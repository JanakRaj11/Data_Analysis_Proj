                                      year the operating environment in egypt improved markedly in comparison
                                      with a challenging 2012 i once again take this opportunity to extend my
                                      congratulations to the team in egypt for their professionalism hard work and
                                      consistent focus on improving productivity which has resulted in another
                                      year of exceptional performance for the operation shareholders should not
                                      underestimate these efforts which allow centamin to stand out in a sector which
                                      generally suffers a reputation of missed forecasts and broken promises
    josef elraghy                    sukaris safety performance was also a significant improvement on the previous
    chairman and ceo                  year with a lost time injury frequency rate of 036 069 in 2012 per 200000
                                      man hours achieved during the period it was again pleasing to note that no
                                      significant environmental incidents have taken place

                                      construction of the stage 4 expansion to double the processing plants
                                      nameplate capacity to 10 million tonnes per annum was complete by the end of
                                      2013 and commissioning is currently under way this major twoandahalf year
                                      expansion project has been completed with minimal cost and timing overruns
                                      this would represent a major achievement in itself but is all the more notable
                                      given the various external challenges that were faced particularly during the
                                      early stages of construction the capital cost estimate of the stage 4 expansion is
                                      us3312 million including contingency with expenditure at the end of 2013 of
                                      us3278 million

                                      commissioning and optimisation of the expanded plant is now a key deliverable
                                      as sukari looks towards a further year of growth in 2014 with our annual
                                      production guidance set at 420000 ounces at a cash cost of us700 per ounce
                                      thereafter we continue to forecast a sustainable output of 450000  500000
                                      ounces per annum from 2015 onwards with scope to exceed the upper limit
                                      once the new plant is fully optimised and operating at abovenameplate levels of
                                      productivity as demonstrated by the existing plant during 2013

                                      sukari is a longlife asset which is supported by a globally significant resource
                                      and reserve base an updated resource and reserve statement was announced
                                      at the end of the year with total resources containing 154 million ounces

the flotation tails of the new circuit will be thickened and
discharged to the tailings storage facility it is expected
that the ore treated through the new flotation circuit will be
predominantly sulphide based ore amenable to recovery
by flotation any ore that may be oxide or transitional in
nature will be treated through the existing processing circuit
by adjustment of the crushed ore product splits to each of
the crushed ore stockpiles

exploration activities
growth of sukari hill
the main focus of exploration to date has been on the
sukari porphyry surface drilling in 2013 continued north              movement of ore
through the ra and gazelle zones and into the northern                 from the open pit to the processing plant
pharaoh zone

during the second half of the year underground drilling was
progressively steppedup as new development provided
improved access from below surface to test potential high

regional exploration
the second pillar of centamins growth strategy is regional
exploration seven other prospects besides sukari hill have
been identified on the 160km2 sukari tenement area and
exploration is being conducted under the principle that
ore from these prospects would be trucked to the existing
processing plant




                                                                                                                                         strategic report
drilling programmes have been under way on the quartz
ridge and vshear prospects to the east and northeast of
the hill respectively during 2013 ongoing drilling to the
south at the kurdeman prospect offers the potential to
fasttrack near surface high grade ore to supplement the
existing production further regional drilling of the sukari
licence is planned for 2013

exploration beyond sukari
the third pillar of centamins strategy is growth beyond
sukari centamin continued exploration on its four

accordingly we actively invest in securing the full spectrum
of skills and competencies needed for effective operations

the companys activities provide direct and indirect
employment training and work experience to many
egyptian nationals as well as creating an immediate
revenue stream for the local economy and the
egyptian government

our workforce has witnessed considerable growth since we
                                                                                                                                  governance
started production in 2010 both in terms of the number
of employees and the range of skills and expertise now
required by our workforce

in egypt we employ 1340 people of whom 93 are
egyptian nationals approximately 50 of our egyptian
nationals are from upper egypt the area where sukari is
situated which typically has less economic activity than the
more prosperous areas around the nile delta

because social conditions in egypt and in the middle east in
general do not encourage the work of female employees in
remote sites a greater percentage of women are employed
throughout the centamin administrative offices

     overview
     centamin is a mineral exploration development and mining company that has been active in egypt since 1995
     the companys principal asset is the sukari gold mine which is located in the eastern desert approximately 900km from
     cairo and 25km from the red sea first gold was poured at sukari on 26 june 2009 and was followed by four successive
     years of growth from approximately 150000 ounces in 2010 to c357000oz in 2013 the doubling of plant throughput
     to a nameplate rate of 10 million tonnes per annum mtpa will see another significant stepup in 2014 as sukari heads
     towards the longterm target production rate of 450500000 ounces per annum from 2015 exploration at sukari hill and
     over the rest of the sukari concession area is continuing with further significant resource and reserve growth expected
     particularly from the high grade underground mine areas

     centamins management team and board of directors have considerable expertise in the gold mining industry this ranges
     from the early stage identification of deposits project financing construction and development to the operating of large
     mines some of the leadership team has been based at sukari for almost a decade taking it from an early stage exploration
     project to the operating gold mine it is today

     centamins operating experience gives it a significant advantage in acquiring and developing other gold projects
     in 2013 centamin agreed a recommended takeover offer for asxlisted ampella mining ltd and formed a joint venture
     with aimlisted alecto minerals plc adding highly prospective licence packages in burkina faso and ethiopia respectively

     accounting for sukari gold mines
     the operating company of sukari sukari gold mines sgm is jointly owned by pharaoh gold mines nl pgm
     and the egyptian mineral resource authority emra on a 50 equal basis for accounting purposes sgm is 100
     proportional consolidated within the centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the
     concession pursuant to the concession agreement the provisions of which are described more fully below pgm solely
     funds sgms activities pgm is also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue
     excluding the royalty payable to the arab republic of egypt are i all current operating expenses incurred and
     paid after the initial commercial production ii exploration costs including those accumulated to the commencement
     of commercial production at the rate of 333 of total accumulated cost per annum and iii exploitation capital
     costs including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial production at the rate of 333 of
     total accumulated cost per annum legal title of all operating assets of pgm will pass to emra when cost recovery is
     completed the right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with pgm and sgm

     since the commencement of commercial production on 1 april 2010 the cash flows generated by sgm through the sale of
     gold are used to fund the ongoing operating expenses incurred in its own right and to fund the cost recovery due to pgm
     for exploration and exploitation capital costs at a rate of 333 of total accumulated cost per annum

     in return ongoing capital expenditure incurred in connection with the sukari mine is funded solely by pgm out of cash flows
     received from sgm through the cost recovery process as described above the expenditure incurred by pgm in relation to
     stage 4 will become recoverable once the infrastructure has been commissioned which is currently planned at the end of
     2013 at the rate of 333 of total accumulated cost per annum legal title of all operating assets of pgm will pass to emra
     when cost recovery is completed the right of use of all fixed and movable assets remains with pgm and sgm

     emra is entitled to a share of sgms net production surplus profit share defined as revenue less payment of the 3
     production royalty to are and recoverable costs based on the companys calculation there was no net profit share due to

shared between emra and pgm any payment made to emra pursuant to these provisions of the concession agreement
will be recognised as a variable charge to the income statement of centamin which will lead to a reduction in the earnings
per share separate accounts are prepared in respect of sgm these are independently audited and certified by egyptian
certified accountants approved by emra any expected profit share payable to emra and pgm becomes payable on
completion of the audit of the sgm accounts centamin will be working together with emra to ensure that these can be
approved as soon as possible so that the profit share can be paid to emra and pgm centamin is looking forward to paying
the first profit share to emra with a view to demonstrating goodwill toward the egyptian government pgm has made

gold mine remains highly cash generative with ebitda of us2342 million 2012 us2333 million centamin has a
robust cash and cash equivalents balance of us1060 million 2012 us1471 million as at 31 december 2013

2013 saw the sukari operation performing well across all areas most notably the processing plant operated consistently




                                                                                                                                    performance review
at c15 above nameplate capacity and the output from the underground mine continued to rise quarteronquarter to end
the year at levels significantly above original expectations the completion of construction of the stage 4 plant expansion
which is currently under commissioning sets the stage for the next stepup in production towards sukaris longterm target
of 450500000 ounces per annum from 2015 onwards

an updated resource and reserve statement for sukari was announced on 18 december 2013 with the total measured
and indicated resource containing 134 million ounces moz and the total reserve containing 82moz the underground
reserve of 230 million tonnes mt represented a 120 increase on the december 2011 reserve despite mining
depletion we remain confident of further significant reserve expansion with the 052mt proven component of
this reserve showing a grade of 114gt gold and continued positive results from ongoing drilling into the target
highgrade extensions

centamin produced 356943 ounces of gold in 2013 which is a 36 increase on 262828 ounces in 2012 the higher
yearonyear production was a result of a a 26 increase in tonnes milled to 57mt due to the improved plant
productivity and availability b an 50 increase in production from the underground due to improved underground mining
contractor equipment availability and c a 4 higher feed grade to the mills 212gt in 2013 compared to 204gt in 2012
as underground productivity and head grades increased

in total material movement was related to increase in the mining fleet capacity during the year additional mining
equipment will continue to be delivered during the first half of 2014

as part of the implementation of stage 4 the company is in discussions with emra and other government departments in
relation to increasing the daily usage of ammonium nitrate an in order to increase open pit mining rates to the required
level to feed the expanded plant the increase in the daily issue of an is still outstanding and this has had an impact on
the movement of waste material compared to the current mining plan however from recent meetings with the relevant
authorities management believe government approval is now in its final stages

ore production from the open pit was 117mt at 081gt with an average head grade fed to the plant of 125gt the rom
ore stockpile balance increased by 1kt to 18kt by the end of the year mining was primarily from the stage 3 area in the

ore production from the underground mine was 587kt the ratio of ore from stoping versus development remained
consistent year on year with 52 of development ore 304kt and 48 of stoping ore 283kt ore production from stoping
and development was in line with forecasts development and stoping requirements were increased in the second half
of 2013

a total of 11620 metres of diamond drilling was completed for both shortterm stope definition and underground resource
development during the year 3786m of development were driven through ore the project development total to date is

15766m of which 9200m were through ore

as part of the development of the ptah area the first crosscut to access the 845 860 875 and 890 levels has been
completed three exploration drill cubbies have been established where drilling is actively taking place ore drives have
been developed on the ptah 875 level and the exhaust system was extended to the 875 level crosscut

processing
the annual throughput in the sukari plant was 57mt in 2013 a 27 increase on 2012 45mt productivity of the
processing plant averaged 700tph for the year 12 above the nameplate design rate of 625tph as the operations team
continued to optimise availability and throughput

plant metallurgical recoveries were 886 in the year a 26 increase on 2012 continued optimisation of operational               governance
controls and improved circuit stability resulted in the recovery steadily increasing throughout the year whilst operational
improvements are being made recoveries are expected to remain consistent until the new carbon regeneration kiln is
commissioned in 2014

exploration update
sukari hill
centamin has resources as of 30 july 2013 of 134 million ounces measured and indicated and 19 million ounces
inferred and reserves as of 30 september 2013 of 82 million ounces underground drilling continued to be steppedup
during the year as new development provided improved access from below surface to test potential high grade extensions
of the deposit underground drilling is utilising 4 longyear lm90 rigs these rigs have been located in the ptah decline
drilling east through both the eastern and the western contact of the porphyry and in the amun area drilling outwards east
and west from the within the porphyry the ore body has neither yet been closed off by drilling to the north nor at depth




                                                                                                                                                      strategic report
further exploration of the sukari deposit will take place during 2014 predominantly from positions within the porphyry in
both the amun and ptah areas

regional exploration
reverse circulation and diamond drilling programmes have been under way on the quartz ridge vshear and kurdeman
prospects to the east northeast and south of the hill respectively during 2013 ongoing drilling to the south at the
kurdeman prospect offers the potential to fasttrack near surface high grade ore to supplement the existing production
further regional drilling of the sukari licence is planned for 2014

growth beyond sukari
centamin continued exploration on its four tenements in northern ethiopia where drilling has confirmed the presence of




                                                                                                                                                      performance review
low grade mineralisation

in september 2013 centamin entered into joint venture with alecto minerals plc to pursue existing and new opportunities
identified by alecto in ethiopia the initial joint venture projects relate to two exploration licences wayu boda and aysid
meketel where exploration activities have now commenced

a recommended allshare takeover offer for asxlisted ampella mining ltd was announced on 10 december 2013
this takeover provides centamin with an extensive licence holding over a highly prospective and underexplored 100km
trend of gold mineralisation in burkina faso as well as further exploration properties in côte divoire centamin will
implement a systematic exploration program aimed at developing the outstanding potential for further significant growth
of the existing resource base comprising 192moz indicated and 133moz inferred

     continued
     liquidity and capital resources continued
     liquidity risk is the risk associated with not having access to sufficient funds to meet planned and unplanned cash
     requirements centamin manages its exposure to liquidity risk by ensuring that its operating and strategic liquidity levels
     are well above minimum company requirements

     trade and other payables increased from us546 million to us781 million reflecting the amounts owed for mining
     equipment which were needed to move the additional material in readiness for stage 4

     in the daytoday business the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital
     expenditure requirements the cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested to maximise returns while ensuring that
     capital is safeguarded to the maximum extent possible by investing only with financial institutions with a strong credit rating

     the groups primary source of liquidity is operating cash flow the principal risk factor affecting operating cash flow is cost
     gold prices timing of gold sales and the legal actions in relation to the concession agreement and subsidy for diesel fuel oil

     the groups financial commitments are limited to planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the sukari
     gold mine planned and discretionary spending on work programmes at the exploration licences owned by sheba
     administration expenditure at the egyptian australian jersey and ethiopian office locations and for general working
     capital purposes

     management considers that the group has adequate current assets and forecast cash flow from operations to manage
     liquidity risks arising from settlement of current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities

     we had no debt for both the 2013 and the 2012 period

     segment disclosure
     the group is engaged in the business of exploration and production of precious metals only which is characterised as one
     business segment only see note 8 to the financial statements

     significant accounting policies estimates and judgments
     in the application of the groups accounting policies which are described in note 3 to the financial statements
     management is required to make judgments estimates and assumptions about carrying values of assets and liabilities that
     are not readily apparent from other sources the estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
     and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis of
     making the judgments actual results may differ from these estimates

     the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are
     recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the
     revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods

     the following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the groups accounting
     policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements

     litigation
     the group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at sukari in
     the manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability the details of this litigation which relate
     to the loss of the egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the group to operate outside the area of
     3km2 determined by the administrative court of first instance to be the area of the sukari exploitation lease are available
     in note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed annual information form aif which is available
     on sedar at wwwsedarcom although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy it is not
     currently possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km2

                                                                                                centamin plc annual report 2013     41




                                                                                                                                         introduction
every action is being taken to contest these decisions including the making of formal legal appeals and although their
resolution may take some time management remains confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved
in the meantime however the group is continuing to pay international prices for diesel fuel oil with respect to the
administrative court ruling on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the companys application to
suspend this decision until the merits of the companys appeal are considered and ruled on thus providing assurance that
normal operations would be able to continue during this process

recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure




                                                                                                                                         strategic report
the groups accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure
being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction
activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the
existence of reserves this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and
circumstances in particular whether the group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether
an economically viable extraction operation can be established such estimates and assumptions may change from period
to period as new information becomes available if subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being
capitalised a judgment is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned the relevant
capitalised amount will be written off to the income statement

reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year

provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
the group is required to decommission rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities the provision has been calculated taking into account the
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities restoration and monitoring of




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
the affected areas the provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date

ore reserve estimates
estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices exchange rates discount
rates and production costs for future cash flows it also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models
the economic geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period changes
in ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties property plant and equipment provision for rehabilitation
assets and deferred taxes ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the
statement of comprehensive income and the calculation of inventory
                                                                                                                                         governance
production forecasts from the underground mine at sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and
reserve growth it is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative
based on current information however as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for
further reserve definition the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production
used in depreciation calculations

depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the sukari mine is based on reserve estimates
management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative based on current information
however as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition
                                                                                                                                         financial statements




the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground
mine development

depreciation of the sukari plant
sukari plant capitalised within plant and equipment is depreciated on a straightline basis over a 45 year economic life
when determining the useful economic life of the plant management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead
to future reserves increases at the sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine which is 2029
based on current reserves management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its
current expiry date of 2035

     management discussion  analysis and business review
     continued
     accounting policies
     the group adopted ifrs 13 fair value measurement refer to note 3 to the financial statements for further details
     there have been no further changes to the groups accounting policies during the year

     going concern statement
     the groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development performance and position
     are set out in this business review the financial position of the group its cash flows liquidity position and borrowing
     facilities are also described in this business review above in addition note 26 to the financial statements includes the
     groups objectives policies and processes for managing its capital its financial risk management objectives details of its
     financial instruments and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk

     as highlighted in note 26 to the financial statements the group meets its daytoday working capital requirements through
     cash generated by its operations the current economic conditions create uncertainty particularly over a the level of
     demand of the groups products b the price at which its products can be sold and c the price at which its main raw
     materials can be procured

     the groups forecasts and projections taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance show that
     the group should be able to continue generating sufficient cash in order to finance its operations and capital expansions

     during the year the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions the first of these followed from a decision
     taken by egpc to charge international not local subsidised prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil and the second arose
     as a result of judgment of an administrative court of first instance in relation to amongst other matters the companys
     160km2 exploitation lease in relation to the first decision the company remains confident that in the event that it is
     required to continue to pay international prices the mine at sukari will remain commercially viable similarly the company
     remains confident that the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the administrative court will ultimately be
     successful although final resolution of it may take some time on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld
     the companys application to suspend the decision until the merits of the companys appeal are considered and ruled on
     thus providing assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process a detailed summary of the
     litigation is available at note 20 to the financial statements

     in the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions and that the operating activities are
     restricted to a reduced area it is the directors belief that the group will be able to continue as a going concern

     the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will have adequate resources to continue in operational
     existence for the foreseeable future thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
     financial statements

     nongaap financial measures
     three nongaap financial measures are used in this report

     1 ebitda ebitda is a nongaap financial measure which excludes the following from profit before tax

         finance costs
         finance income and
         depreciation and amortisation

        management believes that ebitda is a valuable indicator of the groups ability to generate liquidity by producing
        operating cash flow to fund working capital needs and fund capital expenditures ebitda is also frequently used by
        investors and analysts for valuation purposes whereby ebitda is multiplied by a factor or ebitda multiple that is
        based on an observed or inferred relationship between ebitda and market values to determine the approximate total
        enterprise value of a company ebitda is intended to provide additional information to investors and analysts and
        does not have any standardised definition under ifrs and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
        measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs ebitda excludes the impact of cash costs and income
        of financing activities and taxes and therefore is not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from
        operations as determined under ifrs other companies may calculate ebitda differently the following table provides
        a reconciliation of ebitda to profit for the year attributable to the company

     internal controls
     financial reporting controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is
     gathered and reported to management including the ceo cfo and coo on a timely basis so that appropriate decisions
     can be made regarding public disclosure management with the participation of the certifying officers has evaluated the
     effectiveness of the design and operation as of 31 december 2013 of the companys disclosure controls and procedures
     as defined by the canadian securities administrators based on that evaluation the certifying officers have concluded
     that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective and designed to ensure that material information relating to the
     company and its subsidiaries is made known to them by others within those entities

     internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our
     financial reporting and compliance with generally accepted accounting principles in our financial statements management
     evaluated at implementation the design of internal controls over financial reporting and has concluded that such internal
     controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
     and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with international financial reporting
     standards ifrs adopted by the european union eu ifrs in addition there have been no changes in the companys
     internal control over financial reporting during the year ended 31 december 2013 that have materially affected or are
     reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting

     financial instruments
     at 31 december 2013 the group has exposure to interest rate risk which is limited to the floating market rate for cash

     the group does not have foreign currency risk for nonmonetary assets and liabilities of the egyptian operations as these
     are deemed to have a functional currency of united states dollars the group has no significant monetary foreign currency
     assets and liabilities apart from australian dollar and united states dollar cash term deposits

     the group currently does not engage in any hedging or derivative transactions to manage interest rate or foreign
     currency risks

     foreign investment in egypt
     foreign investments in the petroleum and mining sectors in egypt are governed by individual production sharing
     agreements concession agreements between foreign companies and the ministry for petroleum and mineral resources
     or the egyptian mineral resource authority emra as the case may be and are individual acts of parliament

     title exploitation and development rights to the sukari gold mine are granted under the terms of the concession
     agreement promulgated as law no 222 of 1994 signed on 29 january 1995 and effective from 13 june 1995
     the concession agreement was issued by way of presidential decree after the approval of the peoples assembly in
     accordance with the egyptian constitution and law no 61 of 1958 the concession agreement was issued in accordance
     with the egyptian mines and quarries law no 86 of 1956 which allows for the ministry to grant the right to parties to
     explore and mine for minerals in egypt

     whilst the company is the first foreign company to develop a modern largescale gold mine in egypt there is significant
     foreign investment in the petroleum sector several large multinational oil and gas companies operate successfully in
     egypt some of which have long histories in the country and have dedicated significant amounts of capital the company
     believes that the successful track record of foreign investment established by these companies in the petroleum sector is
     an important indication of the ability of foreign companies to attract financing and receive development approvals for the
     construction of major mining projects in egypt

     egyptian court litigation
     as discussed elsewhere in this document the company was involved in two separate actions the first followed from a
     decision taken by egpc to charge international not local prices subsidised prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil and
     the second arose as a result of judgment of an administrative court of first instance in cairo in relation to the companys
     160km2 exploitation lease

     concession agreement court case
     on 30 october 2012 the administrative court in egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by
     amongst others an independent member of the previous parliament in which he argued for the nullification of the
     agreement that confers on the group rights to operate in egypt this agreement the concession agreement was
     entered into between the arab republic of egypt the egyptian mineral resources authority emra and centamins
     whollyowned subsidiary pharaoh gold mines pgm and was approved by the peoples assembly as law 222 of 1994

                                                                                               centamin plc annual report 2013     45




                                                                                                                                        introduction
in summary that judgment states that although the concession agreement itself remains valid and in force insufficient
evidence had been submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km2 exploitation lease between pgm
and emra had received approval from the relevant minister as required by the terms of the concession agreement
accordingly the court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km2 was not valid although it stated
that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km2 centamin however is in possession of the executed
original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km2 exploitation lease was approved by the minister of
petroleum and mineral resources it appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the court




                                                                                                                                        strategic report
upon notification of the judgment the group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine
at sukari these included lodging a formal appeal before the supreme administrative court on 26 november 2012
in addition in conjunction with the formal appeal the group applied to the supreme administrative court to suspend the
initial decision until such time as the court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal on 20 march 2013 the
court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations will be
able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way

emra lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 november 2012 the day after the companys appeal was
lodged furthermore in late december 2012 the minister of petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter
publicly indicated that in his view the terms of the concession agreement were fair and that the exploitation lease was
valid the minister of petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that centamin brings to the




                                                                                                                                        performance review
country the company believes this demonstrates the governments commitment to our investment at sukari and the
desire to stimulate further investment in the egyptian mining industry

the company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude although it is aware of the potential for the process
in egypt to be lengthy the company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from two leading
egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km2
exploitation lease the company therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will
ultimately be successful

in the event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the group
the operations at sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the groups operation exceeds the exploitation




                                                                                                                                        management discussion
lease area of 3km2 referred to in the original court decision

the company remains confident that normal operations at sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal process is under way
centamin does not currently see the need to take the matter to a court outside of egypt as centamin remains of the belief
that the egyptian court will rule in centamins favour

diesel fuel court case
in january 2012 the group received a letter from chevron to the effect that chevron would not be able to continue
supplying diesel fuel oil dfo to the mine at sukari at local subsidised prices thereby adding approximately                        governance
us150 per ounce to the cost of production it is understood that the reason that this letter was issued was that chevron
had received a letter instructing it to do so from the egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc subsequent to
this first letter the group received a demand from egyptian general petroleum corporation egpc for le403 million
us60 million being the amount of the subsidy received in respect of the diesel fuel supplied from december 2009
until january 2012

the group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter and in consequence in june lodged an appeal against egpcs
decision in the administrative courts again the group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is
good prospect of success however as a practical matter and in order to ensure the continuation of supply the group has
since january advanced funds to our fuel supplier chevron based on the international price for fuel further details about
this litigation are set out in note 20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed aif which will be available on

     overview of sukari concession agreement
     pharaoh gold mines nl pgm a 100 whollyowned subsidiary of the company egsma now emra and the arab
     republic of egypt are entered into the concession agreement dated 29 january 1995 granting pgm and emra the
     right to explore develop mine and sell gold and associated minerals in specific concession areas located in the eastern
     desert of egypt identified in the concession agreement the concession agreement came into effect under egyptian law
     on 13 june 1995

     a summary of the main terms of the concession agreement is as follows

      pgm provides funding to the operating company sukari gold mining company sgm and is responsible for the
       daytoday management of that company
      pgm is entitled to recover
         all current operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial production
          exploration costs including those accumulated to the commencement of commercial production at the rate of
            333 per annum and
          exploitation capital costs including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial production at the
            rate of 333 per annum
      the are is entitled to a royalty of 3 of net sales revenue from the sale of gold and associated minerals from the sukari
       gold mine
      commencing on the date of commercial production sgm and pgm is entitled to a 15 year exemption from any taxes
       imposed by the egyptian government with an option to file an application to extend this entitlement for a further
       15 years
      after the deduction of recoverable expenses and the payment of the 3 royalty the profits are shared equally between
       pgm and emra with an additional 10 of proceeds paid to pgm in the first two years that there are net proceeds and
       an additional 5 in the following two years
      pgm emra and the operating company are exempt from custom taxes and duties with respect to the importation of
       machinery equipment and consumable items required for the purpose of exploration and mining activities at sukari
      pgm emra the operating company and their respective buyers will be exempt from any duties or taxes on the export
       of gold and associated minerals produced from the sukari gold mine and
      legal title of all operating assets of pgm will pass to emra when cost recovery is completed the right of use of all fixed
       and movable assets remains with pgm and sgm

     in addition the concession agreement establishes a procedure for the conversion of any exploration lease granted
     in favour of pgm into an exploitation lease upon following the procedure prescribed by the concession agreement
     the company was granted such an exploitation lease in respect of 160km2 in 2005 and is in possession of the original
     document granting this lease duly signed by all relevant parties the validity of this lease is however the subject of the
     litigation referred to above

     for the accounting treatment of the concession agreement refer to note 23 to the financial statements

     principal risks affecting the centamin group
     the exploration for and development of metals and mineral resources together with the construction and development
     of mining operations is a speculative activity that involves a high degree of risk

     centamin conducts a variety of risk assessments throughout the year which are reviewed by the audit and risk committee
     and the board in accordance with best practice guidelines and in compliance with the uk corporate governance code
     and relevant canadian requirements

     centamin takes a number of measures to mitigate risks associated with its underlying operational and exploration activity
     which are monitored and evaluated regularly due to the nature of these inherent risks it is not possible to give absolute
     assurance that mitigating actions will be wholly effective

     the table below describes the key risks affecting centamin and its operational and exploration activities together with the
     measures to mitigate risk and the preserved risk by management

                       inside and outside of egypt until further production growth beyond sukari is identified the risk remains high

sukari project joint   sgm is owned jointly by pgm and emra with equal board representation whilst responsibility for the daytoday
venture risk and       management of sgm rests with the general manager who is appointed by pgm the board of sgm operates by
relationship with      way of simple majority as such should the board of sgm be unable to reach consensus on a matter requiring
emra                   boardlevel approval or in the event of any dispute arising between pgm and emra which pgm is unable to
                       amicably resolve it may have to participate in arbitration or other proceedings to resolve the dispute which
                       could have a material and adverse effect on centamins business results of operations financial performance
                       and prospects
                       any dispute with emra may adversely affect centamins ability to manage the sukari project in the most
                       effective way such a dispute could arise under the cost recovery and profit share provisions of the sukari
                       concession agreement
                       the successful management of the sukari gold mine is in part dependent on maintaining a good working

                       with relevant ministry and other governmental representatives management and the board of directors believe
                       the group has a positive and constructive working relationship with emra the group complies with all terms
                       and conditions of the concession agreement covering the sukari gold mine emra has equal representation on
                       the board of sukari gold mines and is involved to that extent in approving and auditing all work programs and
                       expenditures emra inspectors are closely involved in monitoring all aspects of the sukari operations current
                       discussions with emra are focused on determining the exact timing and quantum of the first payment of profit
                       sharing for sukari whilst the impact would be high management believes there is a low probability of a material
                       deterioration in relationships with emra particularly following the prepayment in relation to future profit share
                       made during the year
                       mitigating factors also include ensuring cooperative relations with emra however the risk identified above
                       remains moderate

                       mine planning methods the pending commissioning of the stage 4 process plant means that the current risk

     capital and            the capital costs for the sukari project and the development of centamins portfolio assets may be significantly
     operational cost       higher than anticipated due to amongst other things unforeseen delays in supplies labour and material cost
     inflation may          inflation local and international political events or workforce disruption in turn this may result in centamin
     reduce anticipated     having to make unexpected calls on its treasury reserves or otherwise seek to raise external financing for which

                            the sukari project has a limited operating history upon which centamin can base estimates of future operating
                            costs the costs timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote
                            location of the sukari project as well as centamins other development opportunities it is common in new mining

                            other metals from the ore and cash operating costs based on a bottomup approach utilising historical data
                            cash operating costs production and economic returns and other estimates contained in previous studies or
                            estimates prepared by or for centamin may differ from those estimated costs currently anticipated by centamin

     mine construction      planned construction and commissioning of the remainder of the expansion of the sukari project and any further

                            may be insufficient andor further issues and costs may be identified any underestimated or unidentified social
                            and environmental costs related to the development and subsequent closure of a mine could potentially reduce
                            earnings and otherwise have a material and adverse effect on centamins business results of operations financial

     reliance on key        the success of centamins operations and activities is dependent to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities
     personnel              of the directors and management team including developing and maintaining or in the context of the recent

                            egypt investors must be willing to rely to a significant extent on centamin directors and the management teams

hazardous            the mining operations of centamin at sukari are often carried out in extreme temperatures whilst centamin

     litigation risks      centamins finances and its ability to operate in egypt may be severely adversely affected by current and any future
                           litigation proceedings and it is possible that further litigation could be initiated against centamin at any time
                           centamin is currently involved in litigation that relates both to a the validity of its exploitation lease at sukari and b the
                           price at which it can purchase diesel fuel oil
                           in order to mitigate this risk centamin has
                           1 engaged appropriate legal advice and continues to actively pursue its legal rights with respect to the existing
                               litigation and its legal advisers believe that centamin will ultimately be successful in both of these cases and
                           2 management and the companys legal advisers monitor both activity in court and local media for signs of any
                              litigation that may threaten its operations finances or prospects
                           the potential for serious impact should be balanced against centamins adherence to local laws and agreements
                           as well as the egyptian governments support of centamins investment and its proposals for a new investment
                           law that could protect centamin against litigation of this nature

                         in this policy for the coming year we believe this simple approach allows a cleaner

                         of other shareholders there is no better union of interest between shareholder and
                         executives than for executives to be substantial shareholders in their own right

                         as reported last year josef elraghy no longer participates in any long term

                         a sufficient link to shareholders interests trevor schultz award of 1000000 shares
                         under the terms of the directors loan funded share plan failed to achieve the
                         necessary performance criteria after the year end and therefore it was agreed that
                         these awards lapse he will receive no further awards for long term incentives

                         for employees the complex loan funded arrangements that previously existed
                         have been replaced with one simple deferred bonus share plan

6 long term incentive arrangements
introduction
the company has had a number of share schemes intended to facilitate employee and executive participation in the
capital value of the company a number of these share schemes were developed to take account of australian tax law
with the review last year and committee concluding that the schemes were too complex and failed to provide any
meaningful motivation or link to shareholder interests those scheme are no longer being used

the existing executive directors no longer participate in any long term incentive arrangement and neither executive
director has any outstanding award under any company share scheme




                                                                                                                                           management discussion
there is a deferred share plan for senior management detailed below

deferred bonus scheme not for directors
this plan introduced in 2013 allows the annual bonus to be matched with shares which are then ordinarily released in
three annual tranches conditional upon the continued employment with the group the plan was introduced as a review of
annual bonus arrangements for management with the objectives of

1 increasing the variable pay element of remuneration
2 introducing a new retention element in the remuneration package and
3	linking part of that reward to the mediumterm share performance of the company                                                      governance

for the initial year and to introduce the plan on 4 june 2013 the company offered to participants of existing plans the
opportunity to replace awards with an initial one off award under the deferred bonus share plan

the plan is not open to directors of the company
                                                                                                                                           financial statements

     2 adoption of new and revised accounting standards
     in the current year no new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted that have affected the amounts
     reported in these financial statements

     standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position
     the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year their adoption
     has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but with the exception of the
     amendment to ifrs 1 may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements
     ifrs 1 amended government loans         the amendment addresses how a firsttime adopter would account for a
                                               government loan with a belowmarket rate of interest when transitioning to
                                               ifrs the amendments mirror the requirements for existing ifrs preparers
                                               in relation to the application of amendments made to ias 20 accounting for
                                               government grants and disclosure of government assistance in relation to
                                               accounting for government loans

     ifrs 7 amended disclosures             amends the disclosure requirements to require information about all
     offsetting financial assets and           recognised financial instruments that are set off the amendments also require
     financial liabilities                     disclosure of information about recognised financial instruments subject to
                                               enforceable master netting arrangements and similar agreements even if
                                               they are not set off under ias 32 the iasb believes that these disclosures
                                               will allow financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect
                                               of netting arrangements including rights of setoff associated with an entitys
                                               recognised financial assets and recognised financial liabilities on the entitys
                                               financial position

     ifrs 13 fair value measurement            ifrs 13 establishes a single framework for measuring fair value when such
                                               measurements are required or permitted by other standards the adoption
                                               of ifrs 13 has not had any significant impact on the fair value measurements
                                               carried out by the group and the amounts reported within the unaudited
                                               interim condensed consolidated financial statements ifrs 13 requires
                                               specific disclosures on fair values some of which replace existing disclosure
                                               requirements in other standards including ifrs 7 financial instruments
                                               disclosures ifrs 13 also results in an amendment to ias 34 requiring that
                                               some of these disclosures relating to financial instruments are made in the
                                               unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements

     improvements to ifrs 2009  2011          aside from those items already identified above the amendments made to
                                               standards under the 2009  2011 improvements to ifrs 2 have had no impact
                                               on the group

                                                                                            centamin plc annual report 2013     93




                                                                                                                                     introduction
at the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations which have not been
applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by
the eu

ias 36 revised                          recoverable amount disclosures for nonfinancial assets

the directors are still considering the impact of adoption of new accounting standards and note that the main impacts
upon the adoption of the new standards will be

 ifrs 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments
 ifrs 10 and 11 will introduce revised definitions of control and joint arrangements and the group will consider the
  accounting for the concession agreement under this guidance the directors determination of the appropriate




                                                                                                                                     performance review
  treatment under the new accounting standards is not expected to have a material impact in the year of adoption and
 ifrs 12 will impact the disclosure of interests the group has in other entities

beyond the information above it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a
detailed review has been completed

     notes to the consolidated financial statements continued
     for the year ended 31 december 2013

     3 summary of significant accounting policies continued
     principles of consolidation
     the consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the entities that comprise
     the consolidated entity being the company the parent entity and its subsidiaries as defined in ias 27 consolidated and
     separate financial statements consistent accounting policies are employed in the preparation and presentation of the
     consolidated financial statements

     the consolidated financial statements include the information and results of each subsidiary from the date on which the
     company obtains control and until such time as the company ceases to control such entity control is achieved where
     the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from
     its activities

     in preparing the consolidated financial statements all intercompany balances and transactions and unrealised profits
     arising within the consolidated entity are eliminated in full

     sukari gold mines sgm is jointly controlled by pgm and emra on a 50 equal basis for accounting purposes
     sgm is wholly consolidated within the centamin group of companies reflecting the substance and economic reality of the
     concession agreement see note 23 pursuant to the concession agreement pgm solely funds sgms activities pgm is
     also entitled to recover the following costs and expenses payable from sales revenue excluding the royalty payable to
     are a all current operating expenses incurred and paid after the initial commercial production b exploration costs
     including those accumulated to the commencement of commercial production at the rate of 333 of total accumulated
     cost per annum and c exploitation capital costs including those accumulated prior to the commencement of commercial
     production at the rate of 333 of total accumulated cost per annum

     emra is entitled to a share of sgms net production surplus defined as revenue less payment of the fixed royalty to are
     and recoverable costs accordingly no emra entitlement has been recognised to date any payment made to emra
     pursuant to these provisions of the concession agreement will be recognised as a variable charge in the income statement

     going concern
     these financial statements for the year ended 31 december 2013 have been prepared on a going concern basis which
     contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations during the year
     the operation of the mine was affected by two legal actions a detailed summary of the litigation is available in note 20
     of these financial statements the first of these followed from a decision taken by egpc to charge international not local
     subsidised prices for the supply of diesel fuel oil and the second arose as a result of judgment of an administrative court
     of first instance in relation to amongst other matters the companys 160km2 exploitation lease

     in relation to the first decision the company remains confident that in the event that it is required to continue to pay
     international prices the mine at sukari will remain commercially viable similarly the company remains confident that
     the appeal it has lodged in relation to the decision of the administrative court will ultimately be successful although
     final resolution of it may take some time on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the companys
     application to suspend the decision until the merits of the companys appeal are considered and ruled on thus providing
     assurance that normal operations would be able to continue during this process

     in the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions and that the operating activities are
     restricted to a reduced area it is the directors belief that the group will be able to continue as going concern

     the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will have adequate resources to continue in operational
     existence for the foreseeable future thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the
     financial statements

     accounting policies
     accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner which ensures that the resulting financial statements satisfy the
     concepts of relevance and reliability thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events
     is reported

     the following significant policies have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of these financial statements

     cash and cash equivalents
     cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits cash equivalents are shortterm highlyliquid investments that are

financial instruments
financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument

financial liabilities and equity
debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the
contractual arrangement




                                                                                                                                            strategic report
equity instruments
an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
liabilities equity instruments issued by the group are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

financial liabilities
financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss fvtpl or other
financial liabilities

financial liabilities at fvtpl
financial liabilities are classified as at fvtpl when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at
fvtpl a financial liability is classified as held for trading if




                                                                                                                                            performance review
 it has been incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term or
 on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the group manages together and has
  a recent actual pattern of shortterm profit taking or
 it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument

a financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at fvtpl upon initial recognition if

 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise
  arise or
 the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both which is managed and




                                                                                                                                            management discussion
  its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the groups documented risk management or
  investment strategy and information about the grouping is provided internally on that basis or
 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives and ias 39 financial instruments recognition
  and measurement permits the entire combined contract asset or liability to be designated as at fvtpl

financial liabilities at fvtpl are stated at fair value with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in
profit or loss the net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability and
is included in the other gains and losses line item in the income statement

other financial liabilities
other financial liabilities including borrowings are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs other financial          governance
liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method with interest expense
recognised on an effective yield basis the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a
financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period the effective interest rate is the rate that
exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or where appropriate
a shorter period

derecognition of financial liabilities
the group derecognises financial liabilities when and only when the groups obligations are discharged cancelled or
they expire

financial assets
                                                                                                                                            financial statements




financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a
contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned and
are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through
the profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value

subsequent to initial recognition investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the company financial statements
other financial assets are loans and receivables the classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition

     effective interest method
     the effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest
     income over the relevant period the effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts
     through the expected life of the financial asset or where appropriate a shorter period to the net carrying amount on
     initial recognition

     availableforsale financial assets afs
     listed shares and listed redeemable notes held by the group that are traded in an active market are classified as being
     afs and are stated at fair value the group also has investments in unlisted shares that are not traded in an active market
     but that are classified as afs financial assets and stated at fair value because the directors consider that fair value can be
     reliably measured fair value is determined in the manner described in note 26 gains and losses arising from changes
     in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated profits with the exception of impairment
     losses interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets
     which are recognised directly in profit or loss where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired the
     cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss

     dividends on afs equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the groups right to receive the dividends
     is established

     the fair value of afs monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and
     translated at the spot rate at the balance sheet date the foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognised in profit
     or loss are determined based on the amortised cost of the monetary asset other foreign exchange gains and losses are
     recognised in other comprehensive income

     loans and receivables
     trade receivables loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
     market are classified as loans and receivables loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective
     interest rate method less impairment interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate except for shortterm
     receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial

     impairment of financial assets
     financial assets other than those at fair value through profit or loss are assessed for indicators of impairment at each
     reporting date financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that as a result of one or more events that
     occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been
     impacted for financial assets carried at amortised cost the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets
     carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate

     the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the
     exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account
     when a trade receivable is uncollectible it is written off against the allowance account subsequent recoveries of amounts
     previously written off are credited against the allowance account changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account
     are recognised in profit or loss

     with the exception of availableforsale equity instruments if in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment
     loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised
     the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the carrying amount of the
     investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the
     impairment not been recognised

     in respect of availableforsale equity instruments any subsequent increase in fair value after an impairment loss is
     recognised in other comprehensive income

derecognition of financial assets
the group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity
if the group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the
transferred asset the group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have
to pay if the group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset the group
continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received




                                                                                                                                       strategic report
employee benefits
a liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries annual leave long service leave
and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably

liabilities recognised in respect of employee benefits expected to be settled within twelve months are measured at their
nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement liabilities recognised in respect
of employee benefits which are not expected to be settled within twelve months are measured as the present value of
the estimated future cash flows to be made by the consolidated entity in respect of services provided by employees up to
reporting date

exploration evaluation and development expenditure
exploration and evaluation expenditures in relation to each separate area of interest are recognised as an exploration and
evaluation asset in the year in which they are incurred where the following conditions are satisfied

a the rights to tenure of the area of interest are current and
b at least one of the following conditions is also met
   i the exploration and evaluation expenditures are expected to be recouped through successful development and
       exploration of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale or

   ii exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not at the reporting date reached a stage which
        permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and
        significant operations in or in relation to the area of interest are continuing

exploration and evaluation assets are initially measured at cost and include acquisition of rights to explore studies
exploration drilling trenching and sampling and associated activities general and administrative costs are only included in
the measurement of exploration and evaluation costs where they are related directly to operational activities in a particular
area of interest

exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances as defined in ifrs 6
exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources suggest that the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation
                                                                                                                                       governance
assets may exceed its recoverable amount the recoverable amount of the exploration and evaluation assets or the
cashgenerating units to which it has been allocated being no larger than the relevant area of interest is estimated to
determine the extent of the impairment loss if any where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount
of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but only to the extent that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised
for the asset in previous years

where a decision is made to proceed with development in respect of a particular area of interest the relevant exploration
and evaluation asset is tested for impairment reclassified to mine development properties and then amortised over the life
of the reserves associated with the area of interest once mining operations have commenced
                                                                                                                                       financial statements




mine development expenditure is recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses
when commercial production in an area of interest has commenced the associated costs are amortised over the
estimated economic life of the mine on a units of production basis

changes in factors such as estimates of proved and probable reserves that affect unit of production calculations are dealt
with on a prospective basis

the costs of stripping activity to be accounted for in accordance with the principles of ias 2 inventories to the extent that
the benefit from the stripping activity is realised in the form of inventory produced the costs of stripping activity which
provides a benefit in the form of improved access to ore is recognised as a noncurrent stripping activity asset where the
following criteria are met

a it is probable that the future economic benefit improved access to the ore body associated with the stripping activity
    will flow to the entity
b the entity can identify the component of the ore body for which access has been improved and
c the costs relating to the stripping activity associated with that component can be measured reliably                              governance

when the costs of the stripping activity asset and the inventory produced are not separately identifiable production
stripping costs are allocated between the inventory produced and the stripping activity asset by using an allocation basis
that is based on a relevant production measure a stripping activity asset is accounted for as an addition to or as an
enhancement of an existing asset and classified as tangible or intangible according to the nature of the existing asset of
which it forms part a stripping activity asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently carried at cost or its revalued
amount less depreciation or amortisation and impairment losses a stripping activity asset is depreciated or amortised on
a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body that becomes more accessible
as a result of the stripping activity the stripping activity asset is depreciated using a units of production method based on
the total ounces to be produced over the life of the component of the ore body

deferred stripping costs are included in stripping assets within tangible assets these form part of the total investment in
the relevant cashgenerating unit which is reviewed for impairment if events or a change in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value may not be recoverable amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in operating costs

      impairment of assets other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets
      at each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether
      there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication exists the recoverable
      amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any where the asset does
      not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets the group estimates the recoverable amount of the
      cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs

      recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use in assessing value in use the estimated
      future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market
      assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future flows have not
      been adjusted

      if the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying
      amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount where an impairment loss subsequently
      reverses the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable
      amount but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have
      been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cashgenerating unit in prior years

      a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or less unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued
      amount in which case the reversal of an impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase

      revenue
      revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services in the normal
      course of business net of discounts vat and other salesrelated taxes

      sale of goods
      revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when the group has passed the significant risks and rewards of
      ownership of the mineral production to the buyer it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will
      flow to the group the sales price can be measured reliably and the group has no significant continuing involvement and
      the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably this is when insurance risk has
      passed to the buyer and the goods have been collected at the agreed location

      where the terms of the executed sales agreement allow for an adjustment to the sales price based on a survey of the
      mineral production by the buyer for instance an assay for gold content recognition of the revenue from the sale of mineral
      production is based on the most recently determined estimate of product specifications

      preproduction revenues
      income derived by the entity prior to the date of commercial production is offset against the expenditure capitalised and
      carried in the consolidated statement of financial position all revenues recognised after commencement of commercial
      production are recognised in accordance with the revenue policy stated above the commencement date of commercial
      production is determined when stable and sustained production capacity has been achieved

      interest revenue
      interest income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the amount of
      revenue can be measured reliably interest revenue is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding
      and at the effective interest rate applicable which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through
      the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount

      production royalty
      the arab republic of egypt are is entitled to a royalty of 3 of net sales revenue as defined from the sale of gold and

where applicable the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent
consideration arrangement measured at its acquisitiondate fair value subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted
against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below all other subsequent
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with
relevant ifrs changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised

where a business combination is achieved in stages the groups previouslyheld interests in the acquired entity are
remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date ie the date the group attains control and the resulting gain or loss

if any is recognised in profit or loss amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have
previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss where such treatment would
be appropriate if that interest were disposed of

the acquirees identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under
ifrs 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date except that

 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and
  measured in accordance with ias 12 income taxes and ias 19 employee benefits respectively
 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the group of an acquirees sharebased payment awards

 assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale

assets held for sale and discontinued operations are measured in accordance with that standard if the initial accounting
for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs the group
reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete those provisional amounts are adjusted
during the measurement period see below or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the
amounts recognised as of that date

the measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the group obtains complete information
about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
investments in associates
an associate is an entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a
joint venture significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee
but is not control or joint control over those policies

the results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method
of accounting except when the investment is classified as held for sale in which case it is accounted for in accordance with
ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations

under the equity method investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted
for postacquisition changes in the groups share of the net assets of the associate less any impairment in the value
                                                                                                                                         governance
of individual investments losses of an associate in excess of the groups interest in that associate which includes any
longterm interests that in substance form part of the groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to
the extent that the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate

any excess of the cost of acquisition over the groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities
and contingent liabilities of the associate recognised at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill the goodwill
is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment
any excess of the groups share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities over
the cost of acquisition after reassessment is recognised immediately in profit or loss

where a group entity transacts with an associate of the group profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the
                                                                                                                                         financial statements

sharebased payments
equitysettled sharebased payments with employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value
of the equity instrument at grant date fair value is measured by the use of the black scholes model where sharebased
payments are subject to market conditions fair value was measured by the use of a montecarlo simulation the fair value
determined at the grant date of the equitysettled sharebased payments is expensed over the vesting period based on
the consolidated entitys estimate of shares that will eventually vest

      3 summary of significant accounting policies continued
      accounting policies continued
      sharebased payments continued
      equitysettled sharebased transactions with other parties are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received
      except where the fair value cannot be estimated reliably in which case they are measured at the fair value of the equity
      instruments granted measured at the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service

      the expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate for the effects of
      nontransferability exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations further details on how the fair value of
      equitysettled sharebased transactions has been determined can be found in note 27 at each reporting date the
      group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest the impact of the revision of the original
      estimates if any is recognised in profit or loss over the remaining vesting period with corresponding adjustment to the
      equitysettled employee benefits reserve

      issued capital
      incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction net of tax
      from the proceeds

      where the company or other members of the consolidated group purchases the companys equity share capital the
      consideration paid is deducted from the total shareholders equity of the group andor of the company as treasury shares
      until they are cancelled where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued any consideration received is included in
      shareholders equity of the group andor the company

      taxation
      income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax

      current tax
      the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
      consolidated statement of comprehensive income because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible
      in other periods and items that are never taxable or deductible the groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax
      rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

      deferred tax
      deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
      statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit deferred tax liabilities are generally
      recognised for all taxable temporary differences deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary
      differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary
      differences can be utilised such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from
      goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction
      that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit

      deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries
      and associates and interests in joint ventures except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary
      difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future deferred tax assets
      arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the
      extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the temporary
      differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future

      the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that
      it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered

      deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the
      liability is settled or the asset realised based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
      by the end of the reporting period the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences
      that would follow from the manner in which the group expects at the end of the reporting period to recover or settle the
      carrying amount of its assets and liabilities

      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
      current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to
      settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis

                                                                                              centamin plc annual report 2013     103

special considerations
in australia centamin egypt limited and pharaoh gold mines nl have elected to form a tax consolidated group and
therefore are treated as a single entity for australian income tax purposes pharaoh gold mines nl has elected into the
branch profits exemption whereby foreign branch income will generally not be subject to australian income tax

in egypt centamin has entered into a concession agreement that provides that the income generated by sukari gold
mining companys activities is granted a longterm tax exemption from all taxes imposed in egypt

restoration and rehabilitation
a provision for restoration and rehabilitation is recognised when there is a present obligation as a result of exploration
development and production activities undertaken it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably the estimated future obligations include
the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities restoration and monitoring of the affected areas the provision for future
restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the restoration obligation
at the reporting date future restoration costs are reviewed annually and any changes in the estimate are reflected in the
present value of the restoration provision at each reporting date

the initial estimate of the restoration and rehabilitation provision relating to exploration development and mining
production activities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and amortised on the same basis as the related asset




                                                                                                                                        performance review
unless the present obligation arises from the production of the inventory in the period in which case the amount is
included in the cost of production for the period changes in the estimate of the provision of restoration and rehabilitation
are treated in the same manner except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a
finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset


4 critical accounting judgments
critical judgments in applying the entitys accounting policies
the following are the critical judgments that management has made in the process of applying the groups accounting
policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements

management has discussed its critical accounting judgments and associated disclosures with the companys audit and
risk committee

impairment of assets other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets
ifrs requires management to test for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
a finite lived asset may not be recoverable as a result of the decline in the gold price the group carried out an impairment
test over the assets other than exploration and evaluation and financial assets

impairment testing is an area involving management judgment requiring assessment as to whether the carrying value of
assets can be supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets using cash flow projections
which have been discounted at an appropriate rate in calculating the net present value of the future cash flows certain               governance
assumptions are required to be made in respect of highly uncertain matters including managements assessment of

      4 critical accounting judgments continued
      critical judgments in applying the entitys accounting policies continued
      litigation
      the group exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related
      to pending litigation as well as other contingent liabilities see note 20 to the financial statements judgment is necessary
      in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed or a liability will arise and to quantify the possible range of
      the financial settlement

      the group is currently a party to two legal actions both of which could affect its ability to operate the mine at sukari in the
      manner in which it is currently operated and adversely affect its profitability the details of this litigation which relate to
      the loss of the egyptian national subsidy for diesel fuel oil and the ability of the group to operate outside the area of 3km2
      determined by the administrative court of first instance to be the area of the sukari exploitation lease are given in note
      20 to the financial statements and in the most recently filed annual information form aif which is available on sedar
      at wwwsedarcom although it is possible to quantify the effects of the loss the national fuel subsidy it is not currently
      possible to quantify with sufficient precision the effect of restricting operations to an area of 3km2

      every action is being taken to contest these decisions including the making of formal legal appeals and although their
      resolution may take some time management remain confident that a satisfactory outcome will ultimately be achieved
      in the meantime however the group is continuing to pay international prices for diesel fuel oil with respect to the
      administrative court ruling on 20 march 2013 the supreme administrative court upheld the companys application to
      suspend this decision until the merits of the companys appeal are considered and ruled on thus providing assurance that
      normal operations would be able to continue during this process

      in the unlikely event that the group is unsuccessful in either or both of its legal actions and that the operating activities are
      restricted to a reduced area it is managements belief that the group will be able to continue as going concern

      recovery of capitalised exploration evaluation and development expenditure
      the groups accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure results in exploration and evaluation expenditure
      being capitalised for those projects where such expenditure is considered likely to be recoverable through future extraction
      activity or sale or where the exploration activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the
      existence of reserves

      this policy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events and circumstances in
      particular whether the group will proceed with development based on existence of reserves or whether an economically
      viable extraction operation can be established such estimates and assumptions may change from period to period as new
      information becomes available if subsequent to the exploration and evaluation expenditure being capitalised a judgment
      is made that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely or the project is to be abandoned the relevant capitalised amount will
      be written off to the income statement

      as described in note 13 to the financial statements management have taken the decision not to renew the shehagne
      or finarwawinibo werie lehe and saharti licences in respect of exploration rights held sheba explorations holding
      limited a wholly owned subsidiary of centamin plc and have thus written off all expenditure incurred to date including the
      acquisition costs in relation to those licences amounting to us6712752

      revenue recognition
      revenue from the sale of mineral production is recognised when the group has passed the significant risks and rewards of
      ownership of the mineral production to the buyer it is probable that economic benefits associated with the transaction will
      flow to the group the sales price can be measured reliably and the group has no significant continuing involvement and
      the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably this is when insurance risk has
      passed to the buyer and the goods have been collected at the agreed location

      going concern
      under guidelines set out by the uk financial reporting council frc the directors of uk listed companies are required
      to consider whether the going concern basis is the appropriate basis of preparation of financial statements

                                                                                                centamin plc annual report 2013     105

the following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
within the next financial year

provision for restoration and rehabilitation costs
the group is required to decommission rehabilitate and restore mines and processing sites at the end of their producing
lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities the provision has been calculated taking into account the
estimated future obligations including the costs of dismantling and removal of facilities restoration and monitoring of
the affected areas the provision for future restoration costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure
required to settle the restoration obligation at the reporting date




                                                                                                                                          management discussion
ore reserve estimates
estimates of recoverable quantities of reserves include assumptions on commodity prices exchange rates discount rates
and production costs for future cash flows it also involves assessment and judgment of difficult geological models the
economic geological and technical factors used to estimate ore reserves may change from period to period changes in
ore reserves affect the carrying values of mine properties property plant and equipment provision for rehabilitation assets
and deferred taxes ore reserves are integral to the amount of depreciation and amortisation charged to the statement of
comprehensive income and the calculation of inventory

production forecasts from the underground mine at sukari are partly based on estimates regarding future resource and
reserve growth it is the opinion of management and directors that these estimates are both realistic and conservative
based on current information however as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for
                                                                                                                                          governance
further reserve definition the life of this part of the mine remains limited and there is a risk that some or all of this growth
will not materialise with a consequent negative impact on current production forecasts which affect the unit of production
used in depreciation calculations

depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs
depreciation of capitalised underground mine development costs at the sukari mine is based on reserve estimates
management and directors believe that these estimates are both realistic and conservative based on current information
however as the mine relies on continued deeper development and exploration drilling for further reserve definition
the estimated reserves may change with a consequent negative impact on the carrying value of capitalised underground
mine development
                                                                                                                                          financial statements




depreciation of the sukari plant
sukari plant capitalised within plant and equipment is depreciated on a straightline basis over a 45 year economic life
when determining the useful economic life of the plant management has assumed that its exploration activities will lead
to future reserves increases at the sukari mine site which will extend its life beyond the current life of mine which is 2029
based on current reserves management have the option to extend the concession agreement by 30 years beyond its
current expiry date of 2035

department that the companies operating in the gold mining sector in egypt were not entitled to such subsidies
in addition the company during the year received a demand from chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received
in the period from late 2009 through to january 2012 amounting to some us60 million eg403 million

the group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter and in particular on the opinion given by legal advice
department of the council of state and in consequence in june 2012 lodged an appeal against egpcs decision in the

      as at the date of the financial statements no final decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter
      furthermore the group remains of the view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome
      and will look to recover funds advanced thus far should the court proceeding be concluded in its favour however
      management recognises the practical difficulties associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this
      reason has fully provided against the prepayment of us970 million as an exceptional item of which us556 million
      was provided for during 2013 as follows

      a a us510 million increase in cost of sales
      b a us17 million increase in stores inventories
      c a us21 million increase in mining stockpiles and ore in circuit and
      d a us08 million increase in property plant and equipment capital wip

      this has resulted in a net decrease of us510 million in the profit and loss

fuel supply
in january 2012 the group received a letter from chevron to the effect that chevron would only be able to supply diesel




                                                                                                                                         management discussion
fuel oil dfo to the mine at sukari at international prices rather than at local subsidised prices which had the effect
of adding approximately us150 per ounce to the cost of production it is understood that the reason that this letter was
issued was that chevron had received a letter instructing it to do so from the egyptian general petroleum corporation
egpc it is further understood that egpc itself issued this instruction because it had received legal advice from the
legal advice department of the council of state an internal government advisory department that the companies
operating in the gold mining sector in egypt were not entitled to such subsidies in november the group received
a further demand from chevron for the repayment of fuel subsidies received during the period from late 2009 through
to january 2012 amounting to eg403 million approximately us60 million at current exchange rates

the group has taken detailed legal advice on this matter and in particular on the opinion given by the legal advice
department of the council of state and in june 2012 lodged an appeal against egpcs decision in the administrative                      governance
courts again the group believes that its grounds for appeal are strong and that there is a good prospect of success
however as a practical matter and in order to ensure the continuation of supply whilst the matter is resolved the group
has since january advanced funds to its fuel supplier chevron based on the international price for fuel

as at the date of this document no decision had been taken by the courts regarding this matter the group remains of the
view that an instant move to international fuel prices is not a reasonable outcome and will look to recover funds advanced
thus far should the court proceeding be successfully concluded however management recognises the practical difficulties
associated with reclaiming funds from the government and for this reason has fully provided against the prepayment of
us970 million as an exceptional item refer to note 6 of the accompanying financial statements for further details on the
impact of this exceptional provision on the groups results for 2013
                                                                                                                                         financial statements




no provision has been made in respect of the historic subsidies prior to january 2012 as based on legal advice
the company believes that the prospects of a court finding in its favour in relation to this matter remain very strong

      concession agreement court case
      on 30 october 2012 the administrative court in egypt handed down a judgment in relation to a claim brought by
      amongst others an independent member of the previous parliament in which he argued for the nullification of the
      agreement that confers on the group rights to operate in egypt this agreement the concession agreement was
      entered into between the arab republic of egypt the egyptian mineral resources authority emra and centamins
      whollyowned subsidiary pharaoh gold mines pgm and was approved by the peoples assembly as law 222 of 1994

      in summary that judgment states that although the concession agreement itself remains valid and in force insufficient
      evidence had been submitted to court in order to demonstrate that the 160km2 exploitation lease between pgm
      and emra had received approval from the relevant minister as required by the terms of the concession agreement
      accordingly the court found that the exploitation lease in respect of the area of 160km2 was not valid although it stated
      that there was in existence such a lease in respect of an area of 3km2 centamin however is in possession of the executed
      original lease documentation which clearly shows that the 160km2 exploitation lease was approved by the minister of
      petroleum and mineral resources it appears that an executed original document was not supplied to the court

      upon notification of the judgment the group took various steps to protect its ability to continue to operate the mine
      at sukari these included lodging a formal appeal before the supreme administrative court on 26 november 2012
      in addition in conjunction with the formal appeal the group applied to the supreme administrative court to suspend the
      initial decision until such time as the court is able to consider and rule on the merits of the appeal on 20 march 2013 the
      court upheld this application thus suspending the initial decision and providing assurance that normal operations would be
      able to continue whilst the appeal process is under way

      emra lodged its own appeal in relation to this matter on 27 november 2012 the day after the companys appeal was
      lodged furthermore in late december 2012 the minister of petroleum lodged a supporting appeal and shortly thereafter
      publicly indicated that in his view the terms of the concession agreement were fair and that the exploitation lease
      was valid the minister of petroleum also expressed support for the investment and expertise that centamin brings to
      the country the company believes this demonstrates the governments commitment to our investment at sukari and the
      desire to stimulate further investment in the egyptian mining industry

      the company does not yet know when the appeal will conclude although it is aware of the potential for the process in
      egypt to be lengthy the company has taken extensive legal advice on the merits of its appeal from a number of leading
      egyptian law firms who have confirmed that the proper steps were followed with regard to the grant of the 160km² lease
      it therefore remains of the view that the appeal is based on strong legal grounds and will ultimately be successful in the
      event that the appellate court fails to be persuaded of the merits of the case put forward by the group the operations
      at sukari may be adversely effected to the extent that the groups operation exceeds the exploitation lease area of 3km²
      referred to in the original court decision

      the company remains confident that normal operations at sukari will be maintained whilst the appeal case is heard

      g credit risk
      credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the
      group the group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral
      or other security where appropriate as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults the group measures
      credit risk on a fair value basis the groups credit risk is concentrated on one entity but the group has good credit checks
      on customers and none of the trade receivables from the customer has been past due also the cash balances held in
      canadian and australian dollars are held with a financial institution with a high credit rating

      the gross carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the groups maximum
      exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral or other security obtained

                                                                                               centamin plc annual report 2013     125

      from such group the actual participants in the 2011 eos there are no current plans for options to be granted under the
      2011 eos

      the 2011 eos provides for employees other than directors to receive up to an annual aggregate of options over ordinary
      shares with an exercise price calculated by either the volume weighted average closing price of ordinary shares sold on an
      exchange for the five trading days most recently preceding the day as at which the market value is calculated or if market
      value is required to be determined in another manner or another amount for the purposes of tax legislation in another
      jurisdiction then the value is so determined at the date of issue the ability to exercise the options is conditional on the
      group achieving its performance hurdles for the initial grants to be made under the 2011 eos it is the current intention
      that the performance criteria will be the tsr performance criteria as detailed in the 2011 executive lfsp further details of
      the performance conditions can be found in the remuneration report there are no outstanding awards under this plan and
      there is no current intention to use the plan

      under the 2011 eos the exercise price of the options is denominated in great british pounds all options expire on the
      earlier of their expiry date or termination of the individuals employment

      deferred bonus share plan
      during the year the company implemented a deferred bonus share plan dbsp which is a longterm share incentive
      arrangement for senior management but not executive directors and other employees participants

      under the dbsp the board shall at its absolute discretion require such eligible participants to defer up to one hundred
      per cent 100 of their bonus opportunity and such eligible participants shall not be paid their deferred bonus in cash but
      shall instead be granted a deferred bonus award over such number of shares provided that the eligible participant remains
      in employment on the date of grant effectively the vesting date the award of the deferred shares will not have any
      performance criteria attached they will however be subject to a service period

      on 4 june 2013 the group offered to both the beneficiaries of the shares awarded under the elfsp and to the majority
      of the beneficiaries of the options granted under the eos the choice to replace their awards and options with awards
      under the dbsp the group has accounted for this change as modifications to the sharebased payment plans and will be
      recognising the incremental fair value granted measured in accordance with ifrs 2 by this replacement over the vesting
      period of the new dbsp awards

      under this offer each participant has been granted a number of awards under the dbsp equivalent to the number of shares
      or options held under the elfsp and eos respectively such dbsp awards shall be subject to the terms and conditions
      of the dbsp and shall ordinarily vest in three equal tranches on the anniversary of the grant date conditional upon the
      continued employment with the group all offers made to participants were accepted

      the total sharebased payment charge relating to centamin plc shares for the year is split as follows

      no lfsp awards or eos options were granted during the year

      the fair value of sharebased payments awarded under the lfsp and granted under the 2011 eos were measured

the fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities are subject to change following a detailed
assessment of the fair values which is currently under way for the purposes of the preparation of the financial statements
management has assumed the following

a inventories have not been adjusted as management do not have sufficient information from which to estimate fair value
b management have assumed that the book value of the property plant and equipment is indicative of fair value as
    detailed valuations have not been performed and




                                                                                                                                                management discussion
c management have allocated the excess of the fair value of the consideration of us466 million over the fair value of the
    identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired to mineral rights

the premium on acquisition of ampella has been calculated as follows
								us000
                     12363
current assets								
noncurrent assets 								1523
current liabilities								914

fair value of assets and liabilities acquired						                                                                           48826

management have assumed that a deferred tax liability will arise for the full value of the uplift to the mine assets based
on the limited information available and accordingly have recorded a deferred tax liability of us108 million the mineral
right inclusive of the deferred tax liability amounts to us466 million

on completion of the detailed fair value exercise certain intangible assets may be identified and recorded separately
this may also result in the recognition of additional deferred tax liabilities further any intangible assets with a finite life
identified in the business combination will be required to be amortised over their useful life

transaction costs are assumed to be approximately us19 million
