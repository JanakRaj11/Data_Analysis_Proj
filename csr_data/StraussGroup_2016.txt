these price reductions are the result of management decisions at strauss israel to make         more accessible to
our manufacturing processes more efficient and therefore pass on these savings to our
consumers in the form of price reductions in order to make our products more accessible
                                                                                                more consumers
to a broader range of consumers while retaining the quality of our ingredients and the
value for our consumers at the time of writing strauss israel is the only food company in
israel that has taken such serious measures to reduce pricelist prices in addition to funding
promotions from time to time in collaboration with the retail groceries throughout the year

                                                       accessible for persons with disabilities includes modifying the infrastructure of the websites
                                                       and adapting them to the various devices used by persons with disabilities since october

                                                       another aspect of making strauss israel more accessible for our consumers relates to our

improving our
impacts on the
environment
preserving our environment is important to strauss as it helps us to become
more efficient through the reduction of resources and therefore costs and it
also contributes to the efforts of the companies to improve the environmental
impacts of our business for global sustainability in our 2020 sustainability
strategy we set targets to reduce our environmental impacts in the area of
energy water emissions and waste in 2015 we invested  131 million in
improving our performance and following several activities we achieved or
even exceed our objectives in the area of water and emissions and we almost
fully achieved our long term energy reduction target in 2016 we will develop
new targets for 2020 that will reflect our new standards of performance and
our expectation of further continuous improvement

our new recyclable bottle
in 2015 we launched yotvata milk in a plastic bottle replacing cartons
the process enabled us to improve efficiencies in production and
transportation reduce our impact on the environment and pass on
some of these savings to our consumers in the form of price reduction of
175 the plastic bottles are transported flat to our factory and inflated
using special equipment as we need them  thereby saving substantial
transportation resources and air emissions  from around 310 trucks per
year to around 30 this process required an investment of around 77
million in new equipment for inflating the bottles in 2016 we expect to
handle more than 30 million bottles we updated our consumers about
the advantages of our plastic bottles in a marketing campaign across
all channels and articles on social media

                                    bottles was very innovative instead
                                    of transporting trucks full of empty
                                    bottles we now transport small tubes

                                    factory this sounds simple but the
                                    process was very complex and required
                                    many changes in our operations in
                                    the end we succeeded and this is a
                                    triple win for our efficiency for the
                                    consumer and for the environment

       our values during 2015 we started a process of        marketing charter
       updating our code of ethics ten years after it was     as part of the sustainability vision of strauss group
       originally written since we launched the code         and in connection with our code of ethics we
       there have been many changes in the nature              understand that responsible and fair marketing
       of business globalization connection between          and advertising is one of the conditions of
       countries and people and new technology                our social license to operate we commit to
       advances and more these changes affect the             ethical behavior in all of our business dealings

       always being tested and rests with the thousands
       of daily decisions and activities we undertake          in 2015 we launched an internal responsible
       every day through our people                           marketing charter as a reflection of this
                                                               commitment in light of the many impacts of
       these changes influence our behavior both               our group across many business lines and in many
       internally and externally and today we are             countries that market food products to millions

ethical behavior
for contractors
in 2015 we terminated a cleaning contractor
in israel as a result of a complaint from one of
the contractors employees about not receiving
full social entitlements after investigation
the complaint proved justified and we ceased
to work with this contractor in the discussion
with the contractor we required payment of all
outstanding entitlements to the 12 employees
that were assigned to work at strauss today
ten of these employees are directly employed
by strauss israel at our logistics center and we
assisted the other two in finding alternative work

notes 
 greenhouse gases included in the calculation of co2e are co2 ch4 and n2o fuel emission factors are taken from ipcc emissions factor database electricity
   emissions factors for israel germany and romania are taken from the national electricity grids all other electricity emissions factors use the ghg protocol
 data for 2014 has been restated to remove obela obela data reported in 2014 included energy water and emissions only
 emissions from ozone depleting substances has been restated for 2014 due to error
 energy consumption from coffee biomass and biogas from wastewater treatment are reported as zero emissions
 other relates to emissions resulting from flaring of excess biogas from waste water treatment not used as an energy source
 reduction in emissions in 2014 is caused by the move from lpg to natural gas and the corresponding update of emissions factors in israel
