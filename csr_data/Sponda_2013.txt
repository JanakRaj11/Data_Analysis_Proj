in 2011 sponda defined seven responsibility priorities the implementation and development of which will be particularly focused on in the
companys operations


the priorities are based on the companys strategy and in particular on its strategic areas of focus related to customer experiences and
environmental responsibility the purpose of the responsibility priorities is to support the development of spondas operations from the
perspective of sustainable development


sponda reviewed the responsibility priorities and their relevance to the operations of the company at the end of 2012 at the same time the goals
related to each priority were reviewed and progress in terms of reaching the goals was assessed


spondas responsibility priorities are


     improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint
     material efficiency
     property locations
     enhancing the customer experience
     investing in employees
     transparency in operations
     taking the industry forward


more detailed information on each of the responsibility priorities can be found in sections dedicated to them in this online annual report

improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon
footprint
the property sector has a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency sponda recognises this and pays
particular attention to the energy efficiency of its properties and the carbon footprint caused by energy consumption



why is this a priority

the eu climate and energy strategy aims for a 20 per cent decrease in the energy consumption of new buildings by 2020 construction activity
and energy consumption of buildings together represent over 40 per cent of final energy consumption


improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions therefore plays a key role in achieving that aim in 2021 all new buildings
must meet near zero energy standards


sponda strives to reach the eu targets through its own operations and through cooperation with clients energy efficiency is an important
consideration in all of the companys property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance operations sponda also encourages
its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties the company also provides
guidance to its clients on energy efficiency and environmentally friendly building use


every day approximately 30000 people work in premises owned by sponda as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy
consumption of a building cooperation between the landlord and tenant is of crucial importance in reducing energy consumption even small
acts can result in major changes


the figures for environmental responsibility concerning spondas properties located in finland are collected on energy and water consumption
and waste management there is a certain degree of annual variability in spondas property holdings due to sales and purchases which affects
the comparability of the annual environment figures


for 2012 comprehensive energy consumption related figures could be collected for sponda properties also in russia



improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint at sponda

the key aspects of the priority are

   the consumption of heat electricity and water in buildings
   property development
   increasing environmental awareness among clients and employees

certification and spondas design guidelines

at sponda new construction property renovation and the design of lowenergy office buildings are all subject to the companys design
guidelines which are in many ways more extensive than the generally applied standards and regulations the guidelines help the company
develop adaptable and energy efficient properties that offer good physical working conditions for tenants and users


sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations in 2011 sponda decided to apply for
international environmental classification an environmental certificate for all new buildings and major renovation projects this allows sponda to
offer the customers increasingly highquality and environmentally friendly premises



energy efficiency programme reduces environmental load

the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through spondas energy efficiency programme originally launched in 2009 the
scheme is aimed at achieving energy savings in cooperation with clients


the energy efficiency programme starts with an energy review in sponda properties to determine the energy consumption of each property and
to examine the different technical systems relating to energy consumption


energysaving goals and measures for achieving them are set individually for each property in cooperation with the users developments are
then monitored in regular meetings with clients spondas partners ovenia oy and corbel oy are responsible for property maintenance
operations and for collecting and monitoring energy consumption data


the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency programme are reinvested in the property the programme initially aims at energy
savings of 10 per cent by 2016 the longterm goal is to achieve a 20 per cent saving in energy consumption by 2020



sponda increases environmental awareness among its employees

spondas head office in helsinki was granted wwf green office certification in 2010 in recognition of the high extent to which environmental
aspects are taken into consideration in office work sponda uses the green office programme to promote the environmental expertise of
personnel and guide employees in making environmentally sound choices environmental awareness is increased through an annual green day
event as well as green office tips published regularly on the company intranet


sponda aims to actively reduce the energy consumption and other environmental load of its head office in 2012 the energy consumption of
spondas head office declined compared to 2011 electricity consumption declined by 39 per cent standardised heating consumption by 45
per cent and district cooling by 238 per cent the major decline in the entire propertys water consumption down 244 per cent from the previous
year is not comparable due to drain damage


spondas employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports lowemission options employees
are also provided with company bicycles as part of spondas green office environmental programme employees are also trained in economical
driving the company makes shared public transport tickets available to employees who need to travel in the helsinki region during the working
day

measures taken in 2012

more properties covered by the energy efficiency programme

at the end of 2012 the energy efficiency programme covered 107 2011 113 properties some of the properties divested during the year were
also omitted from the programme ten properties owned by the real estate funds managed by sponda started their own energy efficiency
scheme in 2012


for properties that joined the programme already earlier energy reviews continued energy saving measures were taken and consumption was
monitored in accordance with propertyspecific action plans


spondas energy efficiency programme has been implemented also in russia since 2010 measures that save energy in the buildings are
determined on the basis of the energy consumption reviews performed in the properties in 2012 sponda launched a tenants energy guide
applicable to russia which was distributed at all spondas properties


monitoring of consumption in the properties and related reporting were developed during 2012 in russia to cover all sponda properties the
consumption of electricity heating and water in the buildings is monitored on a monthly basis the consumption figures are mainly comparable to
the figures for the previous years


energy consumption of spondas properties decreased

the energy consumption of properties owned by sponda decreased in 2012 the measured heating energy consumption of comparable
properties was up by 11 per cent from the previous year however weatheradjusted heating energy consumption was 77 per cent lower than
the year before the total electricity consumption of comparable properties decreased by 48 per cent water consumption declined by 115 per
cent and cooling energy consumption fell by 295 per cent compared to the year 2011


in 2012 the carbon footprint caused by the total energy consumption of all of spondas properties in finland was one per cent higher than the
previous year


in 20112012 sponda took part in preparing the lowenergy construction guidelines of ril  finnish association of civil engineers the guideline
on lowenergy construction of premises was published by ril at the beginning of 2012 sponda also completed its own lowenergy building
concept based on the ril guideline in 2012


sponda joined the city of helsinkis and businesses joint climate partners network in 2012 the network aims to create new operating methods
to reduce climate emissions and strengthen the competitiveness of companies

customer cooperation for the environment

sponda encourages its customers to energy savings also in its environmental partnership programme launched in 2011 which aims to reduce
the environmental load caused by the use of buildings through joint efforts the number of environmental partners was increased in 2012


the content of the extranet service for customers was expanded in 2012 and the service is in use in an increasing number of properties the
extranet service gives customers guidance on energy efficient operations and waste sorting and also includes news on the progress of the
energy efficiency programme clients can also use the extranet to monitor the energy consumption of their property on a monthly basis


sponda arranged four environmental events at clients premises in partnership with wwf finland during 2012 the events open for everyone
offered diverse environmental information and encouraged the users of premises to think about environmental issues

material efficiency
spondas efforts in promoting material efficiency are particularly focused on waste sorting and providing instructions for waste
sorting the aim is also to reduce the amount of waste generated in construction work



why is this a priority

in 2008 the finnish government approved a national waste plan aimed at reducing waste generation and achieving a reduction in the total
annual volume of municipal waste by 2016 the objective of the plan is to have less than 20 per cent of municipal waste end up in landfill sites
with the remaining 80 per cent recycled or used for energy generation sponda aims to contribute to the overall effort to reach the goals of the
national waste plan through its own operations



material efficiency in spondas operations

the key aspects of the priority are

   the sorting and recovery of property waste
   improving efficiency in material use also in purchasing
   producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental effects


while the appropriate sorting of waste is the responsibility of the users of properties sponda aims to facilitate convenient sorting of waste at its
properties through its own operations and by ensuring that the necessary waste sorting facilities are in place the company arranges for post
sorting waste management unless otherwise agreed with tenants sponda encourages the users of properties to recycle and sort waste and to
reduce the total volume of waste


reducing the volume of waste generation is an integral aspect of material efficiency spondas construction and renovation projects take this
aspect into account by investing in flexible and adaptable spatial solutions in building design this reduces construction wastegenerating
alteration work during the use of the building
