                                              ceo statement
                                              a genuine concern for society and our community has been part
                                              of our family history for almost two centuries and represents the
                                              fundament of the business principles our forefathers adopted for
                                              gc rieber following generations of leaders and owners have
                                              further developed and strengthened our value base social
                                              responsibility has always been a core element of our competitive
                                              advantage which is why i like to call our approach responsible
                                              innovation

warren buffet once said that social responsibility is expensive and that sustainable behavior requires
sacrifices at the expense of profitability research has so far failed to provide clear answers to whether
organizations which score high on social responsibility are more or less profitable than those who dont

i tend to agree that social responsibility and sustainability may imply a cost in the short term one may
miss a profitable contract because it doesnt pass through internal quality controls a project may become
more expensive due to investments in research and alternative technology and there is certainly no
room for cutting corners to save a penny

however my strong conviction is that sustainability and responsibility contribute to profitability in the
long run as a matter of fact i believe they are a prerequisite for every companys survival business is
all about trust from stakeholders our reputation is our most valuable asset and the key to attracting
talent acquiring new business and ensuring investor loyalty it is only through a transparent and honest
dialogue with our stakeholders that we can prove who we are and what we stand for understanding and
respecting our stakeholders interests and expectations enables us to adjust our course in due time and
to ensure that we keep delivering products and services which create value it is the opposite that will
cost us dearly

unfortunately we dont always get it right the first time and changing realities may take us by surprise
we are therefore humble towards the challenge that lies in achieving our sustainability goals however
our allegiance to continuous improvement is stronger than ever this includes our unbroken
commitment to the principles of the un global compact initiative

if we at the end of a day  or a year  are unable to document progress and a contribution to making the
world a better place we need to pull out of a project business area or investment for our own sake and
for the sake of society

in this annual communication on progress we describe our csr framework and our actions to
continually improve the integration of the global compact and its principles into our business strategy
culture and daily operations we also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our
primary channels of communication

sincerely yours

business and leadership principles
the core of elements our modern csr policy may be found already in our founders business principles
from 1879 which among other state

healthy growth and sound financial development can be achieved only if there is open interaction
between the company and its business associates employees owners and the community at large
for our targets to be reached none of these groups may exploit its strength at the expense of the
others

the company shall treat natural resources with respect never to be squandered these resources
are to be passed on to future generations in at least as good shape as they were in when we took
over

inclusive leadership is one of our core principles for gc rieber executives and implies that we expect
our leaders to build an organization that takes responsibility  for its customers wider society the
environment and each other

based on our strong business principles and core values we have developed internal guidelines for
ethics and csr that we expect all gc rieber employees to adhere to the guidelines contain general
principles for best practice and professional conduct and represent the fundament of our core beliefs
and our corporate culture


code of conduct for suppliers and partners
in order to make our position on csr and sustainability clear to our business partners we have set up
a code of conduct coc gc rieber will when selecting suppliers and prior to making investments
consider compliance with this coc along with other relevant aspects the coc provides a framework
for what we consider to be the minimum standard for professional conduct


csr policy strategy and action plans
our csr policy is an integral part of our organization and reflects our business goals at gc rieber we
involve and engage all parts of the organization in csr work

social responsibility and sustainable development are integrated throughout our entire business
operations we believe that our group companies can better support international sustainability
programs by actively using their knowhow and competence to drive economic environmental and
social development through own initiatives and efforts

each business area in the gc rieber group identifies businesscritical sustainability goals and aligns
them with their respective key stakeholders expectations those goals are then turned into action
plans which are communicated internally and externally and monitored continuously


quarterly csr reporting
all businessunit leadership groups provide quarterly csr progress reports according to a common
format based on the ten ungc principles these reports are presented and discussed in company and
group board meetings to ensure toplevel commitment and to monitor continuous followup on
relevant measures
