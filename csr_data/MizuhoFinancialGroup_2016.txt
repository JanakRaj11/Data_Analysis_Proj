     governance to be strengthened while the board delegates                       frequently discussions lasted for close to four hours as a
     to the management substantially more decisionmaking                            result of the participation of outside directors with experi
     power on business execution as a result the speed of                          ences in various fields their ideas provided new perspectives
     decisionmaking increases and the board is able to engage                      on management issues in addition the presence of outside
     in discussions regarding substantive corporate management                       directors helps the management to have stronger commit

3 securities
  in accordance with accounting standard for financial instruments the business accounting deliberation council
  january 22 1999 mhfg classifies securities excluding those of investments in nonconsolidated subsidiaries and
  affiliates into three categories based upon managements intent these securities are accounted for as follows
  i trading securities are carried at market value and included in trading assets
  ii bonds held to maturity are stated at amortized cost straightline method and determined by the moving average
        method
  iii other securities are securities which are not classified as either trading securities or bonds held to maturity other
        securities which have readily determinable fair value are stated at fair value with changes in net unrealized gains or
        losses net of applicable income taxes after excluding gains and losses as a result of the fairvalue hedge method
        included directly in net assets the fair value of japanese stocks is determined based on the average quoted
        market price over the month preceding the consolidated balance sheet date the fair value of securities other than
        japanese stocks is determined at the quoted market price if available or other reasonable value at the consolidated
        balance sheet date cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the movingaverage method other securities
        the fair values of which are extremely difficult to determine are stated at acquisition cost or amortized cost which is
        determined by the movingaverage method
      in addition investments in affiliates not under the equity method are stated at acquisition cost as determined by the
  moving averagemethod
      securities which are held as trust assets in money held in trust accounts are valued in the same way as securities
  above
  certain securities other than trading securities excluding securities for which it is deemed to be extremely difficult to
  determine the fair value are devalued to the fair value and the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair
  value is treated as a loss for the fiscal year impairment devaluation if the fair value primarily the closing market
  price at the consolidated balance sheet date has significantly deteriorated compared with the acquisition cost including
  amortized cost and unless it is deemed that there is a possibility of a recovery in the fair value the amounts of
  impairment devaluation were 9161 million 81294 thousand and 3206 million for the fiscal years ended march
  31 2016 and 2015 respectively




                                                                                                                            165

2 contents and risk of financial products
  the main financial assets of the mizuho group consist of loans to customers and securities such as japanese stocks and
  government bonds the group holds these securities for the purpose of reserves for deposit payments reserves and as
  investments these financial assets are subject to various types of risk that may cause the group to incur losses due to
  a decline in or total loss of the value of assets as a result of deterioration in a counterpartys andor an issuers financial
  position credit risk or due to a decline in the value of assets caused by fluctuations in interest rates stock prices and
  foreign exchange rates and so on market risk
     the main financing source of the mizuho group is a stable source of deposits from its customers in addition to direct
  funding from the financial market these financing sources are subject to the risk of losses liquidity risk arising from
  funding difficulties due to market disruption or a deterioration in our financial position that makes it difficult for us to raise
  the necessary funds or that forces us to raise funds at significantly higher interest rates than usual
     in addition the mizuho group uses derivative financial products to control the interest rate risk related to the assets
  and liabilities of the group as part of our asset and liability management alm the group primarily utilizes the
  portfolio hedge by grouping numerous financial assets and liabilities such as loans and deposits into similar interest risk
  units in accordance with risk management policies some derivative products like interest rate swaps are used as
  hedging methods for cashflow hedges or fair value hedges the group applies hedge accounting to the majority of
  these products treating them as deferred hedges the effectiveness of the hedges is assessed periodically by
  regression analysis and other methods to ensure whether the derivative financial products effectively work in order to
  offset the exposure to changes in fair value and variable cash flows from hedged items it should be noted that the
  mizuho group uses derivative financial products for trading purposes and so on as well
     as financial services become more complex and diverse the mizuho group is exposed to various risks including credit
  risk liquidity risk and other risks

3 risk management for financial products
  a commitment to risk management
      we recognize the conducting of operations tailored to the risks and managing such risks as a key issue relating to
      overall management in order to implement our business strategy while maintaining our financial stability we
      maintain comprehensive risk management and control measures
         we maintain basic policies for risk management established by our board of directors that are applicable to the
      entire mizuho group these policies clearly define the kinds of risks to be managed set forth the organizational
      structure and provide for the human resources training necessary for appropriate levels of risk management the
      policies also provide for audits to measure the effectiveness and suitability of the risk management structure in line
      with these basic policies we maintain various measures to strengthen and enhance the sophistication of our risk
      management system
  b general concept of risk management
      we classify our risk exposures according to the various kinds of risk including credit risk market risk liquidity risk
      and operational risk and manage each type of risk according to its characteristics
         in addition to managing each type of risk individually we have established a risk management structure to identify
      and evaluate overall risk and where necessary to devise appropriate responses to keep risk within limits that are
      managerially acceptable in both qualitative and quantitative terms
         more specifically we allocate risk capital to our principal banking subsidiaries including their respective
      subsidiaries and other core group companies to control risk within the limits set for each company we also control


204

    risk within managerially acceptable limits by working to ensure that the overall risk we hold on a consolidated basis
    does not exceed shareholders equity and other measures of financial strength to ensure the ongoing financial
    health of mizuho financial group our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies we regularly
    monitor the manner in which risk capital is being used in order to obtain a proper grasp of the risk profile within this
    framework reports are also submitted to the board of directors and other committees of each company
c credit risk management
    the board of directors of mizuho financial group determines basic matters pertaining to credit risk management in
    addition we have established the risk management committee as one of its business policy committees this
    committee broadly discusses and coordinates basic policy in connection with credit risk management and matters in
    connection with overall credit portfolio management and credit risk monitoring for the mizuho group under the
    control of the chief risk officer of mizuho financial group the risk management division and the credit risk
    management division jointly monitor analyze and submit suggestions concerning credit risk and formulate and
    execute plans in connection with basic matters pertaining to credit risk management
       we have adopted two different but mutually complementary approaches in credit risk management the first
    approach is credit management in which we manage the process for each individual transaction and individual
    obligor from execution until collection based on our assessment of the credit quality of the customer through this
    process we curb losses in the case of a credit event the second is credit portfolio management in which we
    utilize statistical methods to assess the potential for losses related to credit risk through this process we identify
    credit risk and respond appropriately
       we use statistical methods to manage the possibility of losses by measuring the expected average loss for a one
    year risk horizon expected loss and the maximum loss within a certain confidence interval credit var the
    difference between expected loss and credit var is measured as the credit risk amount unexpected loss we
    recognize two types of risk arising from allowing unexpected loss to become too large one type is credit
    concentration risk which stems from granting excessive credit to certain individual counterparties or corporate
    groups the other type is chainreaction default risk which arises from granting excessive credit to certain areas
    industrial sectors and other groupings we manage these risks appropriately in line with our specific guidelines for
    each
       the board of directors of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies determines
    key matters pertaining to credit risk in line with basic policies set forth by mizuho financial group their respective
    business policy committees are responsible for discussing and coordinating overall management of their individual
    credit portfolios and transaction policies towards obligors
       the chief risk officer of each principal banking subsidiary and core group company is responsible for matters
    relating to planning and implementing credit risk management the credit risk management division of each principal
    banking subsidiary is responsible for planning and administering credit risk management and conducting credit risk
    measuring and monitoring each credit division determines policies and approvesdisapproves individual
    transactions regarding review and management of and collection from customers in accordance with the lines of
    authority set forth by each principal banking subsidiary in addition each of our principal banking subsidiaries has
    also established internal audit divisions that are independent of the business divisions in order to ensure appropriate
    credit risk management
d market risk management
    the board of directors of mizuho financial group determines basic matters pertaining to market risk management
    policies in addition we have established the risk management committee as one of its business policy committees
    the committee broadly discusses and coordinates matters relating to basic asset and liability management policies
    risk planning and market risk management and proposes responses to emergencies such as sudden market
    changes
       the chief risk officer of mizuho financial group is responsible for matters relating to market risk management

      for trading and banking activities we set limits for var and for losses for banking activities we set position limits
      based on interest rate sensitivity as needed
         our principal banking subsidiaries and certain other core group companies have formulated their basic policies in

      matters relating to market risk management while their chief executive officers are responsible for controlling
      market risk based on a common mizuho group risk capital allocation framework the abovementioned companies
      manage market risk by setting limits according to the risk capital allocated to market risk by mizuho financial group
         they have the same market risk management structure as the mizuho financial group such as their business
      policy committees being responsible for overall discussion and coordination of the market risk management
         in addition they have established middle offices specializing in risk management that are independent of their
      front offices which engage in market transactions and their back offices which are responsible for book entries and
      settlements this system enables them to achieve mutual checks and control over market operations
         when var is not adequate to control risk the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices such as 10

               historical observation period of one year
     iii crossshareholdings
         for crossshareholdings we take the same market risk management approach as that for banking and trading
         businesses with the use of var and risk indices
            the risk index for the crossshareholdings sensitivity of the portfolio to a 1 change in the equity index of
         topix is 297 billion 263991 thousand and 374 billion for the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 and 2015
         respectively
     iv risk management using var
         var is a commonly used market risk management technique with statistical assumptions to measure maximum
         possible loss in the market which will be incurred to the holding portfolio in a certain period with some probability
         it should be noted that in general var model has the following shortcomings
               var estimates could differ by assumptions of holding period confidence interval level and approaches for
                 the measurement
               var which is calculated based on historical data does not necessarily indicate an accurate future possible
                 maximum loss
               var might underestimate the probability of extreme market movements when the market gets inactive as
                 var assumes sales of holding portfolio and hedges in the market during the holding period for the
                 calculation
               the use of a 99 confidence level neither takes account of nor makes any statement about any losses
                 that might occur beyond this confidence level
            the variance covariance model used as the measurement technique of var assumes that change in a market
         movement follows a normal distribution therefore the model might underestimate the risk under the
         circumstance that the market is likely to move extremely beyond the assumption the model might also
         underestimate the risk when the normal correlation assumption between interest rate and share price collapses
         under the circumstances when a rise in the interest rate and a deterioration of share price happen simultaneously
            we check the validity of the market risk measurement made by var approach periodically by the backtest
         which compares var with actual profit and loss in addition to var we make a wide variety of management and
         controls such as risk indices monitoring implementation of stress tests loss limit monitoring in order to make strict
         risk management by capturing carefully all risks including what var approach is not able to cover
f liquidity risk management
     our liquidity risk management structure is generally the same as the market risk management structure described
     above item d market risk management however the head of the financial control  accounting group of
     mizuho financial group is additionally responsible for matters relating to planning and running cash flow
     management operations while the financial planning division is responsible for monitoring and adjusting the cash

      flow management situation and for planning and implementing cash flow management reports on the cash flow
      situation are submitted to the risk management committee the executive management committee and the
      president  ceo
         we measure liquidity risk using indices pertaining to cash flow such as limits on funds raised in the market limits
      on liquidity risk are discussed and coordinated by the risk management committee discussed further by the
      executive management committee and determined by the president  ceo we have established classifications for
      the cash flow conditions affecting the group ranging from normal to anxious and crisis and have established
      procedures for dealing with cases which are deemed to fall into the anxious or crisis categories in addition we
      have constructed a system under which we will be able to respond smoothly in the event of emergency situations
      that affect our funding by establishing action plans

4 supplementary explanation of matters relating to fair value of financial instruments and others
  fair values of financial instruments include the values based on market prices and the values deemed as market prices
  obtained by the reasonable estimate when the financial instruments do not have market prices since certain
  assumptions and others are adopted for calculating such values they may differ when adopting different assumptions
  and others

              riskbased capital

             3 summary of approach to assessing capital adequacy

             in order to ensure that riskbased capital is sufficiently maintained in light of the risk held by us we regularly conduct the
             following assessment of capital adequacy in addition to adopting a suitable and effective capital adequacy monitoring
             structure

             maintaining a sufficient bis capital ratio

             we confirm our maintenance of a high level of financial soundness by conducting regular evaluations to examine whether
             our riskbased capital is adequate in qualitative as well as quantitative terms in light of our business plans and strategic
             targets to match the increase in riskweighted assets acquired for growth in addition to maintaining our capital above the
             minimum requirements of common equity tier 1 capital ratio tier 1 capital ratio total capital ratio and capital buffer ratio

             balancing risk and capital

             on the basis of the framework for allocating risk capital after obtaining the clearest possible grasp of the groups overall
             risk exposure we endeavor to control risk so as to keep it within the range of our business capacity by means of allocating
             capital that corresponds to the amount of risk to the principal banking subsidiaries etc within the bounds of our capital
             and we conduct regular assessments to ensure that a sufficient level of capital is maintained for our risk profile when
             making these assessments we calculate the potential losses arising from assumed stress events and risk volumes which
             we assess whether they balance with the groups capital stress events are based on risk scenarios that are formulated
             based on the current economic condition and the economic outlook etc and from scenarios such as the occurrence of
             historical stress events in addition we examine whether an appropriate return on risk is maintained in the assessments

              we apply the advanced internal ratingsbased approach to calculate credit riskweighted assets under basel
              framework with regard to some business units or asset classes that are deemed to be immaterial for
              purposes of calculating credit riskweighted assets we apply the standardized approach
              we use our estimates of pd probability of default and lgd loss given default in calculating credit risk
              weighted assets in accordance with regulations we estimate pd by using longterm averages of actual
              defaults to which conservative adjustments are made based on internal data and make adjustments to lgd
              taking into account recessionary periods we regularly perform verifications of pd and lgd through back
              testing and other methods we also utilize these estimates for measuring credit risks for internal use

              evaluate the value of the collateral guarantee performance capability of guarantor and legal enforceability and we also
              conduct periodical subsequent reevaluations furthermore we monitor the state of concentration of collateral type and
              concentration of credit risks in individual companies including indirect credit exposure such as guarantees
              when calculating the credit risk weighted assets for capital adequacy ratio regulations the effect of credit risk mitigation
              through financial collateral mainly deposits and securities other collateral mainly real estate and guarantees by
              sovereign banks or corporations above a certain credit rating is reflected
              for derivatives transactions and repurchase transactions in cases in which a bilateral netting contract is valid in light of

             9 management of counterparty risk in derivatives transactions and longsettlement transactions

             in managing the risk pertaining to counterparty risk in derivatives transactions and longsettlement transactions we
             generally allocate risk capital together with loans etc as to derivatives transactions with financial institutions etc we
             periodically where necessary deliver and receive collateral to and from the counterparty based on the replacement cost
             to mitigate credit risk collateralized derivatives transactions in conducting such transactions there is a risk in which we
             may be required to provide additional collateral in cases where our credit profile deteriorates we calculate reserves for
             derivatives transactions by multiplying the same reserve ratio that we use for loans etc against the replacement cost

summary of securitization exposure and its risk management

             the structure of these products also contains risks related to the originators the administrators trustees and managers of
             the underlying assets

             to address these risks we also analyze the structure in terms of the underlying assets and credit events we monitor the
             ability quality and operating performance of originators and managers in charge of controlling the underlying assets as
             well as covenant information and credit status of the parties related to the program
             in addition for resecuritization products we pay attention to the underlying assets of the underlying securitization products

             we also assign internal ratings to all products and review the rating at least once a year if there is a change in the credit
             situations we will review the internal rating as appropriate as mentioned above we have established a system to
             comprehensively understand the risk characteristics of securitization exposures and manage these exposures

             we conduct credit risk measurements on all credit transactions including securitization transactions furthermore we
             carry out periodic monitoring on investment amount and performance on securitization transactions and report the
             situations to our risk management committee etc

             status of response to basel framework

             in calculating credit riskweighted assets of securitization exposure under the internal ratingsbased approach we apply
             the ratingsbased approach rba if the asset has a rating obtained from eligible external credit assessment institutions
             and apply the supervisory formula approach sf in other cases pursuant to the fsa notice no 20 we apply a risk
             weight of 1250 under basel iii when neither rba nor sf can be applied

             in addition in calculating credit riskweighted assets of securitization exposure under the standardized approach we
             calculate based on risk weight according to ratings by eligible external credit assessment institutions and weighted
             average risk weight of underlying assets

             in terms of securitization exposure in our trading book that is subject to market risk regulations we adopt the standardized
             measurement method and calculate market risk equivalent amounts in connection with the specific risks of securitization
             products based on risk weights according to ratings assigned by eligible external credit assessment institutions pursuant to
             the fsa notice no 20

             reasonably calculated prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management as fair value unless it is deemed to
             be extremely difficult to determine the fair value in deriving reasonably calculated prices based on the reasonable
             estimates of our management we used the discounted cash flow method and the price decision variables include default
             rates recovery rates prepayment rates and discount rates

             furthermore we apply appropriate accounting treatment on compound financial products based on report on auditing
