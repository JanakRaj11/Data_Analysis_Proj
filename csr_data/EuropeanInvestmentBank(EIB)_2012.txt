        an eib project ten years down the line
        in 2000 the eib lent gbp 105m for the design rebuild refurbishment and maintenance of
        29 secondary schools in the city of glasgow in 2011 the glasgow schools project was the subject
        of an ex post evaluation

        with a population of 590 000 inhabitants glasgow is scotlands largest city and the thirdlargest
        provider of higher and further education in the uk despite recent improvements it has a high
        prevalence of social deprivation and economic uncertainty one in four glaswegians claims
        welfare benefits one in two families is headed by a single parent and 33 of the working
        age population are unemployed education attainment levels have been below the national
        average for decades and for a long time performance has been inconsistent across glasgow
        citys schools with secondary schools in especially poor condition and needing substantial
        refurbishment with a backlog of maintenance costs




20   corporate responsibility report   2011

                                                                                                                                          responsible finance
                                                                                                                                         for jobs and growth




        at the turn of the century public authorities decided to allocate more resources to education
        however since the glasgow city council could not afford to commit to the necessary level
        of investment from its own resources they chose a publicprivate partnership5 scheme to
        meet such major challenges at the same time this was also considered to be a good way for
        improving the delivery and management of public services

        in 2000 the glasgow city council decided to close 10 secondary schools while providing
        32 500 pupil places in 28 strategically placed schools they were all intended to be modern
        standard amenities providing a stimulating highquality learning environment with premium
        information and communications technology ict available sharing a site with a secondary
        school one primary school was added to the scheme

        the main idea behind the entire project was to transfer the rebuildingrefurbishment life cycle
        maintenance and physical operation facilities management of the 29 schools to the private
        sector over a 30year concession period 12year contract only for ict services

        some broad economic and social objectives were also defined ie to raise educational standards
        even though no quantitative targets were set or quantified ex ante in view of the neglected
        state of most of the schools the impact was also expected to have a knockon effect on the
        selfesteem and wellbeing of the local population finally the project was a key strategic tool
        used by glasgow city council to retain the population in the inner city and to limit the difficulties
        induced by a very rapid decline in population notably with regard to the management of public
        services and public facilities

        evaluation results
        the glasgow schools project was highly relevant in terms of european national and local
        needs the project was effective and efficient thanks to a good level of delivery during both
        the construction and operational phases limited cost overruns few delays relatively good
        coordination between many players and entities it was sustainable thanks to a good degree
        of flexibility from the counterparts and structures forming the consortium the project also
        has a solid economic model finally it was excellent with regard to its impact on the social and
        economic environment

        eib contribution and management
        as one of the first educational projects and one of the banks first ppps the appraisal phase was
        particularly detailed and carefully carried out incurring many indepth appraisal missions de
        facto this appraisal phase took place as a sort of ppp benchmark exercise for the eib in particular
        with regard to the legal aspects the implementation of the project was carefully monitored and
        monitoring continues until this day as this is a longterm loan with specific features notably its
        ppp nature bank staff pay regular visits to the project

     independent limited assurance report
     to european investment bank

     assurance on the following information included in the corporate responsibility report 2011 for the year ended
     december 31 2011 of european investment bank the report indicators and statements in the report

     european investment bank managements responsibility for the report

     european investment banks management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the

     applicable in 2011 at the bank as detailed on page 36 of the report for determining the european investment
     banks objectives in respect of sustainable development performance and reporting including the identification
     of stakeholders and material issues and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management
     and internal control systems from which the reported performance information is derived



     responsibility of the réviseur dentreprises agréé

     our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the
     work performed we conducted our engagement in accordance with international standard on assurance
     engagements isae 3000 assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial infor
     mation as adopted for luxembourg by the institut des réviseurs dentreprises that standard requires that we
     comply with applicable ethical requirements including independence requirements and that we plan and
     perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the indicators and statements in the report
     marked with a tick  are free from material misstatement

     a limited assurance engagement on a sustainability report consists of making inquiries primarily of persons
     responsible for the preparation of information presented in the sustainability report and applying analytical and
     other evidence gathering procedures as appropriate these procedures included

      inquiries of management to gain an understanding of the banks processes for determining the material issues
        for the banks stakeholder groups

                                                                                to european investment bank




 comparing the information presented in the report to corresponding information in the relevant underlying
   sources
 inquiries about the design and implementation of the systems and methods used to collect and process the
   information reported including the aggregation of data into information as presented in the report
 with regard to the indicators and statements marked with a tick  included in the report verifying that they
   were correctly derived from the banks 2011 audited financial statements when applicable

a limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement or an
audit conducted in accordance with international standards on auditing and assurance engagements and
consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters
that might be identified in an audit or a reasonable assurance engagement accordingly we do not express a
reasonable assurance conclusion on the report as a whole or on the indicators and statements in the report
marked with a tick 



conclusion

based on the limited assurance procedures performed as described above nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that the indicators and statements in the report marked with a tick  are not prepared
in all material respects in accordance with the internal reporting criteria applicable in 2011 at the bank as
detailed on page 36 of the report
