at infosys we have taken the energy efficiency of our new buildings                 chillers and efficient inline pumps coupled to the chiller better control
to a new level by implementing innovative technologies and smart                     valves and automation are available in the market today
automation our buildings are therefore among the most efficient                    the main advantage of retrofits is that the new equipment can be sized
globally at the same time we have taken up major retrofits at our                  very accurately based on measured operating parameters over a period
existing buildings particularly for our air conditioning systems                   of time thereby improving efficiencies greatly all these deployed at
to bring them to the highestpossible efficiency levels in the last three           old chiller plants result in a dramatic reduction in the connected load
years several chiller plants at our campuses have been retrofitted                 as well as in the energy consumption
to eliminate wastage and bring about huge reductions in energy
                                                                                     for instance one of our chiller plants was retrofitted from a

the case for a retrofit begins with a detailed audit of all the equipment            system the pumping system was changed from a bank of endsuction
of the chiller plant including the chilled water pumps condenser                   pumps to vertical inline pumps coupled to the chiller the improved
pumps cooling towers and chillers over a period of time the load in              design has helped reduce the number of valves from 74 to 25
the buildings might have undergone changes through the replacement
                                                                                     the reduced pressure drop in the plant room and the rightsizing and
of equipment with newer and more efficient technology advancements
                                                                                     selection of efficient pumps resulted in a reduction in the connected

two years ago we took up a challenge of reducing 1 mw of connected load at each of our five major locations in india  bangalore mysore
hyderabad chennai and pune today after retrofitting 24 chiller plants across these locations we have achieved a reduction of 72 mw in
connected load with savings of 157 million units

our retrofit projects had a payback period of about two years for the investment made towards the entire retrofits including a central plant
manager this implementation serves as an example for the industry to invest in major retrofits to effect significant reductions in operations costs

use and discharge at a specific site or operation
iwt uses data from a number of sources to assist companies in
developing a more holistic planning approach towards combating
watershortage situations by comparing a companys site with
the best available water and sanitation data based on country and
watershed criteria the global water tool answers questions such as 
how many of my sites and what percentage of my production is in
overexploited or critical aquifers or which of my sites are in rising
or falling groundwater areas
we are incorporating more granular indiaspecific water datasets
into the tool which will lead to mproved analytics as part of this

          assessments of methods practices tools and competence used in collection aggregation and reporting of data as it is
          transferred and managed at different levels of the organisation

conclusions

in dnvs opinion based on the work carried out the report is a fair representation of the companys sustainabilityrelated
strategies management systems and performance the report along with the referenced information in the web site and annual
report meets the general content and quality requirements of the gri g31 and dnv confirms that the report meets
requirements for application level a we have evaluated the reports adherence to the following principles on a scale of good
acceptable and needs improvement

stakeholder inclusiveness we reviewed the existing stakeholder engagement process its implementation across the sampled
sites and confirm that the company is committed to understanding the stakeholder concerns as an ongoing process the process
may be further strengthened to consolidate all stakeholder concerns and create central repository of stakeholder concerns the
report may also bring out the key stakeholder concerns and the companys response in more coherent manner in our view the
level at which the report adheres to the principle is good

materiality the materiality determination process has been reworked considering the internal and external inputs and we are of
the opinion that the outcome of the process has not missed out any significant known material issues the process may be
extended to cover all its operations spread across geographies to understand the emerging frontier material issues risks in our
view the level at which the report adheres to the principle is acceptable

completeness the report has fairly attempted to report or reflect the sustainability strategy management approach and
sustainability performances against the gri g31 disclosures and core indicators the report brings out the responses related to
partial reporting omissions and commitments to full reporting related to aspects and performance indicators that are material
within the companys reporting boundary for application level a in our view the level at which the report adheres to the principle
is acceptable

responsiveness we consider that the companys response to key stakeholder concerns ie policies and management systems
including governance are fairly reflected in the report within the reporting boundary set for this report the future reports may
bring out companys response to material value chain issues across all operations and geographies in our view the level at which
the report adheres to the principle is acceptable

reliability the majority of data and information verified at head office and sites were found to be accurate some of the data
inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to transcription interpretation and aggregation
errors and the errors have been corrected hence in accordance with the moderate level assurance engagement we conclude that
the specified sustainability data and information presented in the report are generally reliable in our view the level at which the
report adheres to the principle is good

neutrality the company has reported its sustainability issues and performance in terms of content and presentation a neutral
tone in our view the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good

opportunities for improvement

the following is an excerpt from the observations and opportunities reported back to the management of infosys however these
do not affect our conclusions on the report and they are indeed generally consistent with the management objectives already in
place
      the report could enlarge its disclosures related to material issues of information technology and business process
          outsourcing considering the peers disclosures and may extend the boundary to cover the entire infosys group
      the materiality assessment approach may identify issues which go beyond the gri indicators and develop performance
          metrics for material issues to enable benchmarking with sector peers
      to evolve an issue based multi stakeholder engagement process to completely map the expectation and needs of
          definitive stakeholders and may incorporate these as inputs to annual strategic planning process
      consider routine communication of key sustainability performance in its website for the benefit of stakeholders
      to further improve the reliability and traceability an erp based system may be evolved to capture performance indicator
          data at source for all key sustainability performance indicators
