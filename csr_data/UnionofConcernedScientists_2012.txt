1 a message from our president

                                                 since 2006 the union of concerned scientists
                                                 ucs has measured the greenhouse gas ghg
                                                 emissions footprint of our organization which
                                                 houses over 135 staff across offices in four states
                                                 while our ghg footprint is contingent upon the
                                                 emissions intensity of the various modes of
                                                 production and transportation that we employ
                                                 and work constantly to improve we strive to
                                                 make concerted operational efforts to further
                                                 reduce that impact reducing paper usage
                                                 whenever possible implementing composting
                                                 across three offices committing to green office

                                                 supported agriculture are just a few of the myriad
                                                 ways we have mitigated our organizations
                                                 impact on the environment and atmosphere

                                                this year we continued to use the
                                                internationallyrecognized global reporting
                                                initiative gri g3 guidelines we measured our

                                                gathered information about our employees work
and commute habits in order to inform future internal policy decisions we are proud to announce
that in 2010 we achieved more than a 6 reduction in our overall emissions

ucs also purchased renewable energy credits in amounts that correspond to our emissions from
electricity and natural gas usage these credits help fund vital solar and wind power projects and
spur further development of a lowcarbon economy we hope that our efforts to reduce our
carbon footprint and to comprehensively understand the extent of that footprint will serve as a
model for other organizations the way organizations talk about operational sustainability is an
ongoing discussion and we seek to further that dialogue in the years to come

31 reporting period
january 1st 2010 december 31st 2010

32 date of most recent previous report
this is the second year we are completing a gri report however we have conducted a
comprehensive carbon foot printing exercise for the last 4 years ucs has been reporting on
greenhouse gas emissions associated with our use of electricity since 2002 ucs began reporting
with the california climate action registry ccar an organization that ucs helped to found
when we lobbied for passage of ca sb 1771 in 2001 when ccar transitioned to the carbon
registry tcr in 2009 ucs began reporting into their system

in 2010 ucs transferred our carbon emission reporting from the carbon registry tcr to the
global reporting initiative gri the gri reporting template is specifically designed for nonprofit
organizations and allows us to report and track a wider range of sustainability activities and
global warming emission sources

ucs remains a basic member and supporter of tcr we continue to encourage businesses and
larger global warming emitters to report and track their emissions through tcr which includes
independent thirdparty verificationa critical component in ensuring accurate accounting of
emissions

33 reporting cycle annual biennial etc
this report covers calendar year 2010 with a few acceptations noted in the data

34 contact point for questions regarding the report or its contents
miriam swaffer sustainability coordinator mswafferucsusaorg or 510 8091564

35 process for defining report content
we utilized the gri g3 template for nonprofit reporters

35 how did you decide what you selected to report on and who to report to
in past years we have measured our carbon footprint in all areas where data was available in
2009 we increased our reporting to include the items recommended in the gri g3 standards the
primary audience of this report is internal however it will be posted publicly on the ucs website
wwwucsusaorg in coming years ucs plans to share our sustainability story and best practices
with a wider audience including the larger notforprofit and nongovernmental organization
ngo communities

36 boundary of the report
this report includes all facilities and operations under ucs control members and activists are
located worldwide but primarily in the us

                                               amount of emissions associated with them


electricity
the chart below demonstrates ucs electricity over time this chart displays our megawatt hour
mwh usage over time which has gradually increased and a breakdown by office with a
comparison between 2008 and 2010 in 2010 electricity use increased in each of our offices
except dc the cross office average increase was only 241 the cross organizational increase
can largely be attributed to the more than 10 growth in power demand from our headquarters
in 2010 the headquarters saw an increase in number of staff and the installation of an air
conditioning unit into the computer room on the 5th floor which accounts for this spike

we work diligently to minimize its energy use and when possible generate renewable energy on
site ucs has taken aggressive energy efficiency measures including installation purchasing
policies that encourage the purchase of energy star approved appliances lighting and products
usage of daylighting whenever possible and conducting an energy efficiency audit in our
cambridge office our headquarters boasts a solar panel array on the roof

however in order to operate our offices we still find that we need to use electricity from the
power grid much of this electricity use has a negative impact on our environment because most of
it is generated from coal natural gas and other greenhouse gas emitting fossil fuels

you might think it is impossible for us to take responsibility for and mitigate the environmental
impact of our electricity after all there is no way to ensure that the electricity we use from the
power grid is generated from renewable resources since there is no physical way to tag an
electron as having been generated from solar wind or other renewable resources rather than
from fossil fuels just as water from different watersheds is mixed together in our municipal water
systems before reaching our faucets electricity generated using renewable and fossil fuel energy
resources is mixed together in the power grid before it reaches our lights computers and
appliances

fortunately there is a way for the union of concerned scientists to ensure that for every
megawatt hour of electricity it uses a megawatt hour of electricity generated using renewable
resources is delivered to the grid renewable energy generation creates two distinct products
electricity and the environmental benefits such as a lack of toxic pollution and global warming
emissions associated with that renewable energy generation these benefits have value to
organizations and households who want cleaner energy and are sold by green power projects in
the form of renewable energy certificates also known as recs tradable renewable certificates or
green tags each rec represents the environmental attributes of one megawatthour kwh of
renewable electricity

recs provide a way for electricity users like the union of concerned scientists to encourage
green power project development purchasing recs increases overall demand for renewable
energy and raises the value of recs sold by green power projects improving these projects
economic viability the renewable electricity generated by new green power projects flows into
the power grid helping avoid the need for fossil fuelbased electricity

ucs has chosen to match 100 percent of its offices electricity use with recs certified by greene
energy the nations leading voluntary certification program for renewable energy for over a
decade greene energy has been certifying renewable energy that meets environmental and
consumer protection standards that it developed in conjunction with leading environmental
energy and policy organizations

we are matching our electricity use with greene energy certified recs purchased from 3degrees
a fourtime winner of the department of energys green power leadership award these recs
will be generated by photovoltaic solar panels installed at schools in milpitas california wind
farms in iowa and other green power projects located in the midatlantic pjm electricity market

business travel
business travel the second largest source of co2e
at ucs stayed at a relatively stable 192mts a 52
increase from 2009 the significant decrease in
emissions from business travel from 2008 to 2009
was in part due to economic downturn which
decreased travel budgets it was expected that 2010
would see a significant rise in travel budgets and
thus the resulting emissions this was not the case
and because air travel is such a large component of
our carbon footprint the stabilization has had a
large impact on our overall greenhouse gas
emissions

some of this decrease can be attributed to the form
of transportation staff chose when traveling the
figure to the right show that as air travel
decreased car travel increased more than doubling
from 2008 to 2010 cars have a lower ghg emissions profile for shorter trips and thus are a
better choice


paper usage
paper usage reduction has been a goal of the sustainability program at ucs for many years the
three many sources of paper usage are publications development mail and office use see the
chart below for details

                                                            publications including reports and
                                                            factsheets are a key strategy for
                                                            disseminating ucs positions on
                                                            policy and are thus core to our
                                                            work emissions from publications
                                                            saw a 3159 decrease from 2009
                                                            to 2010 the stf speculated that
                                                            staff was overordering publication

                                                            excess of what was being used this
                                                            waste of resources also meant that
                                                            the organization was constantly

calculator3 the guide asks the report author to think through the dissemination plan for the
report as well as its shelf life additional reductions in publications emissions can be attributed to
the organizations shift from longer reports to shorter factsheets that can be printed inhouse
this enables staff to print publications on demand and thus reduces over ordering of printed
materials these conclusions will be tested in 2011 to see if this decline in emissions is continued

development mail ie hard copy monetary appeals to potential and current donors emissions
increased over 38 from 20092010 while some of this increase is due to improvement in the
data quality we did see an increase of about 16 in the number of pieces of mail we sent in 2010
vs 2009 the additional emissions were key to the organizations bottom line the additional mail
brought us 10000 new members and an increase of 150000 in revenue from all members gifts
from new members  gifts from renewed members

office use that is paper used to print and copy emissions decreased by 60 this success is
credited to a 2009 campaign involved taking some printers offline and thus forcing staff to walk
further to retrieve their print outs changing printer defaults to double sided made paper usage
more visible by tracking quarterly and encouraging interoffice competition

two sources of emissions that saw significant declines in 2010 were natural gas usage and
commuter travel the reporters suspect that these reductions are generally from changes in the
process of capturing of these data sets

    further discussion of print quantity calculator in indicator 11 sub section reducing paper use

indicator 11 initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reductions achieved
ucs convened the sustainability task force stf comprised of staff members from all our
organizations programs and offices the stf meets monthly to identify and implement green
practices across a wide range of issues including procurement power management and event
planning the stf has undertaken an impressive array of projects since its inception in 2008
these projects are summarized below

organizational guidance to help ensure that both internal and external operations are as
environmentally friendly as possible the stf reviewed and revised planning documents and
paperwork to ensure that sustainability was a common thread throughout for example the stf
updated the organizations travel guidance policies to advocate for lowimpact travel options
whenever possible and revised the staff travel voucher form used to reimburse staff for work
related purchases made on business trips to collect data such as distance traveled and mode of
transit for carbon accounting purposes we also updated our internal eventplanning guide to
incorporate practices such as choosing locally grown food for meals and adding recycling andor
compost bins in meeting rooms

reducing paper use the evolution of technology has allowed us to distribute more of our
reports fact sheets and member publications electronically saving paper and money in the
process to help further reduce the number of printed copies needed we created a print quantity
calculator form that staff use when creating printed materials to help them accurately determine
how many copies they will need and avoid overordering the dramatic decrease in emissions from
publications can be attributed in part to the deployment of print quantity calculator we have
further reduced emissions in out washington dc office by offer printondemand capability by
printing only what is needed when it is needed staff do not feel obligated to go to a copy shop or
commercial printer and order a larger quantity of materials than they will ultimately use
instituting quarterly reporting on copy and printer paper use has led to friendly competition
driving further reductions

energy use monitoring ucs obtained a professional energyefficiency audit in its cambridge
ma headquarters to identify options for further reducing energy use the cambridge office is a
green renovation buildout and is already significantly more efficient than similarly sized
conventional office space in the area we monitor electricity and natural gas use in all four ucs
offices cambridge ma washington dc berkeley ca and chicago il and use this data in our
annual carbon accounting analyses in these analyses we also report on heattrapping emissions
from business and commuter travel and paper use

increasing staff sustainability efforts ucs staff are deeply committed to environmental issues
both personally and professionally the stf has helped ensure that staff can reduce their impact
not just in the office but to and from the office as well for two years stf staff have coordinated
events around national bike to work week we offer contests among staffand among offices
to encourage participation and also offer incentives for walkers to take part

another area in which we have fostered staff sustainability efforts is food in 2010 our cambridge
headquarters and dc office joined the berkeley office in offering composting composting has
been widely embraced by staff and greatly reduces the amount of trash we generate ucs

leadership in implement composting has led to wider adoption the success of both the berkley
and dc office composting programs lead the building managers to adopt composting building
wide enabling over a 200 other businesses including a restaurant to begin composting their food
waste

in 2010 we scoped the potential for delivery of community supported agriculture csa shares to
our offices we are excited about the synergy this project has with our policy analysis and
advocacy in recent years of food and environment program has taken up the issue of local food
and small farms by providing delivery of csa shares to the offices we create further
opportunities for staff to support these policies

spreading the word ucs is proud of the work it does to promote a cleaner environment in
addition to quarterly updates to staff about stf projects and accomplishments ucs shares its
sustainability work with the public online at wwwucsusaorgaboutoursustainabilityefforts in
fiscal year 2012 we plan to build both our external and internal communication processes and
capacities by launching a communications subcommittee of the stf hiring a sustainability intern
with experience communicating about sustainability and working with our peer organizations to
better understands how to communicate about this aspect of our work we hope to revamp our
web present and are scoping including this sustainability report in our annual report


indicator 12 total workforce including volunteers by type contract and region
150 staff members and approximately several hundred volunteers


indicator 13 average hours of training per year per employee by employee category
all employees receive approximately 34 hrs of orientation training including it office
administration and harassment policy training all staff are offered voluntary training in meeting
management 8 hrs personal time management 8 hrs and additional software training 816
hrs 50 of employees in positions in close proximity to hr or memberdonor information are
provided with privacy policy training 1 hr supervisors and project managers receive 8 hrs in
supervision training and 8 hrs of management training this amounts to a minimum of 3 hrs and a
maximum of 53 hrs training average 28 hrs


indicator 14 percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career
development reviews
100 of employees receive annual performance reviews

indicator 15 composition of governance bodies and breakdown of employees per category
according to gender age group minority group membership and other indicators of
diversity
ucs employees are approximately 60 female the management team is 50 female
approximately 13 of employees are noncaucasian exact data is not available for age but the

organization is generally diverse in age range with several staff in their 20s several in their 60s
and many in between ucs is also diverse in education with many bas mixed with phd scientists

indicator 16 nature scope and effectiveness of any programs and practices that assess
and manage the impacts of operations on communities including entering operating and
exiting
we have limited community impact due to our size and location in major us cites and we do not
have a program in place to assess impact

at the state and regional level we partner with local academics and activists to provide them with
the analysis to amplify their work we have used this model to develop a series of global warming
impacts reports which supported the enactment of the two current caps on green house gas
emissions in the us regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi and the california global warming
solutions act also know as ab 32

indicator 17 percentage of employees trained in organizations anticorruption policies
and procedures
100 staff are trained in anticorruption policies

product responsibility

indicator 18 programs for adherence to laws standards and voluntary codes related to
ethical fundraising and marketing communications including advertising promotion and
sponsorship development and product review process memos
development and hr staff oversee all compliance for fundraising and marketing ucs is certified
in all 50 states for solicitation ucs undergoes an annual audit allowing us to use funds and gain
tax certification as a 501c3 organization the full organization even outside of the state follows
guidelines from the massachusetts privacy act regarding donor information
