 conducting measures on equipment in line with the new regulatory standards to prevent the occurrence of nuclear accidents
 and to mitigate the impacts and restore the station to its normal status as quickly as possible in the event of a disaster we are
 also strengthening our antidisaster measures
enhancing antidisaster measures
 in order to prevent abnormal radioactive emissions in the event of an incident at the nuclear power station and to suppress
 and mitigate the impact in the event of such emissions we are establishing the necessary system and manuals and securing
 the requisite goods and materials we will also continue to conduct drills to ensure the effectiveness of these measures and
 improve our ability to respond to disasters while enhancing cooperation with the national and local governments and thereby
 increasing the practicality of our antidisaster measures

 disaster management system
 we have a disaster management system based on which we will establish          disaster management system
 the emergency task force headquarters in the head office and at the
 power station these headquarters will collect and share information and
                                                                                                                          chubu electric power

    implementing further measures on equipment based on new ﬁndings and
    regulations in addition to conventional measures
      chubu electric power has long been committed to improving the safety of the hamaoka nuclear power station based on new
      ﬁndings with this strong commitment we are implementing measures on equipment in line with the new regulatory standards
      and based on ﬁndings obtained from the accident at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station

                                                   measures against earthquakes
    the hamaoka nuclear power station is designed
    to have high seismic resistance and we are also
    implementing measures against the tripleinterre
    lated tokai tonankai and nankai earthquakes
        further in line with the new regulatory stan
    dards set by the nuclear regulation authority
    and also in consideration of the various ground
    motion ampliﬁcations identiﬁed in the premises
    based on the ground motion evaluation we set
    new ground motion parameters at present we
    are working on alterations of the supports for
    conduit pipes and electric cables as well as on                                      support reinforcement

                                                  measures to improve management efﬁciency
we are making an allout effort to reduce the procurement costs for materials equipment and services improve the efficiency
of thermal power generation procure fuels at cheaper prices and increase operational efficiency so that we can improve our
management efficiency as we planned in estimating the power supply cost in consideration of the governments strict assessment
policies for the approval of electricity rates
    we will continue to implement measures for higher management efficiency to achieve a lowcost structure and increase our
competitiveness in the market

reducing procurement costs by standardizing speciﬁcations
we will standardize machinery specifications which each electric power company has independently set thereby reducing
procurement costs

 our replies to opinions and questions raised by customers
              about the rise of electricity rates                                                                            customers




q1   we are already bearing the growing cost of thermal power fuels under the fuel
     cost adjustment scheme so surely this rise in electricity rates was unnecessary



 a     the fuel cost adjustment scheme is designed to incorporate changes in fuel prices into electricity rates
       however changes in the amount of fuel consumption are not considered under the system
           at present the consumption of fuels for thermal power generation is increasing because of the full
       shutdown of the hamaoka nuclear power station but electricity charges paid by customers have not been
       increased to cover the additional fuel cost caused by higher fuel consumption
           in order to ensure the safe and stable supply of electricity as our most important corporate mission we
       decided with regret to raise our electricity rates




q2   the rise of electricity rates will have a great impact on households ﬁnances
     have you made any efforts to improve contract types in response



 a     we have added the peak shift lighting type and also relaxed the conditions necessary for customers to
       sign an e life plan contract we will continue making improvements to contract types to provide customers
       with more options from which they can choose one suitable for their lifestyle
           on our website we provide a simulator with which customers can compare various contract types based
       on their actual use of electricity in order to identify the type that will lead to lower electricity charges
           in the future we will introduce smart meters which will clearly show the amount of electricity used by
       customers and based on the findings we will provide customers with more diversified contract types to
       meet their needs




q3   since youve raised electricity rates surely we dont need hamaoka nuclear
     power station anymore



 a     in japan with its limited energy resources in order to deal with rising fossil fuel prices and issues like global
       warming and at the same time secure stable energy into the future we believe that we must continue to utilize
       nuclear power as a vital energy source whilst making a priority of securing safety and the trust of the public
            with regard to the hamaoka nuclear power station we are steadily implementing hardware safety
       improvement measures starting with our ongoing tsunami and earthquake countermeasures preparing
       software measures on the disaster prevention side and aiming to adapt as quickly as possible to the new
       regulatory criteria furthermore with regard to the initiatives of chubu electric power we believe that
       nothing is more important than conscientiously explaining our activities to local residents and society at
       large and gaining their understanding




                                                                                 chubu electric power company group annual report 2014   18

                                                basic ideas on investments

                          at chubu electric power we anticipate that our difficult financial situation will continue
                          during the ongoing suspension of the operation of the hamaoka nuclear power plant
                          although the increase of electricity rates is expected to have a positive impact on our balance
                          sheet and cash flow conditions
                              to fulfill our primary mission ensuring a safe and stable electricity supply we will con
                          tinue to make the utmost effort to further improve safety of the nuclear power plant and
                          take various measures to ensure a stable power supply we will also pursue better operational
                          efficiency in order to return to profitability at the earliest possible juncture and strengthen
                          our financial position
                              at the same time we will continue to strengthen our efforts to achieve further business
                          growth and build a stronger foundation for sustained future growth and communicate the
                          progress and achievements of these efforts with our customers and shareholders



                      indispensable investments for a safe and stable electricity supply
                      we will promptly and steadily implement necessary safety improvement measures for our facilities
                      including the hamaoka nuclear power station we will also build facilities that are indispensable for
                      supplying lowcarbon highquality energy at reasonable prices in a stable manner
                          we will design and implement these initiatives in such a way as to ensure investment efficiency


                      strategic investments for business growth and development
                      to build a stronger foundation for sustained growth in the future we will make strategic investments
                      for business growth and prosperity while managing the associated risks appropriately
                          we will carefully select strategic investments by strictly adopting rigorous criteria


                      shareholder return
                      our policy on shareholder return effective july 30 2012 is as follows



                          the company will work to maintain stable dividends after taking account of financial
                          conditions and other factors while continuously investing in construction and operation of
                          facilities that are essential for a safe and stable supply of electricity



                      for fy 2013 no dividends were declared due to the continued severe financial situation we
                      sincerely regret that we were unable to meet the expectations of our shareholders
                          for fy 2014 our forecast assumes there will be no interim dividends given the necessity for
                      further improvement of management efficiency and financial strength a forecast of final dividends
                      of the fiscal year has not been determined yet because it is difficult to make an accurate or
                      reasonable forecast at this point in time

chubu electric power group what we aim for
                            chubu electric power group what we aim for

             to be a corporate group that satisﬁes
         all energyrelated needs and keeps growing

on the reform of electricity systems specific discussions are underway including the
establishment of an organization for widearea power system operation in 2015 the proposed
full liberalization of the electricity retail business by around 2016 and the enhancement of
neutrality of the power transmissiondistribution sector by around 2018 to 2020
   with regard to this chubu electric power believes that a competitive marketplace where
customers can select freely what service to purchase from whom will encourage electric
business operators to innovate and make greater efforts to achieve a stable and efficient
power supply which will eventually result in creating an even better and more customer
friendly power system
   the business environment of the energy sector in japan will go through a sea change in
the future because the government is considering the reform of not only power systems but
also gas service systems to facilitate more active competition
   considering these ongoing and upcoming changes as a great opportunity for us we
will take aggressive actions to ensure stable power supply provide a wide range of energy
services through competition and ultimately translate what we aim for into reality

     energy at reasonable prices
     chubu electric power makes various efforts to ensure stable supply of lowcarbon high quality energy
     at reasonable prices speciﬁcally we aim to ensure reliable fuel procurement at lower costs by acquiring
     upstream interests and taking other measures to strengthen the value chain of fuels we have also started
     to install highly efﬁcient thermal power stations to curb co2 emissions

     more reliable economical and flexible fuel procurement
     competition for energy resources is intensifying globally in                                 beyond this through direct involvement in fuel production
     anticipation of middle to longterm tight energy supplies due                               purchase transportation and other processes through
     to growing demand in emerging countries and other causes                                    which we aim to strengthen the entire fuel value chain
         to address this situation we are working to procure                                     spanning fuel acceptance and electricity generation
     fuel in a more reliable and economic manner and strive to                                        as a result we can keep ourselves informed about fuel
     increase ﬂexibility in our procurement to ensure a prompt and                                production status and other necessary information which
     appropriate response to supply and demand ﬂuctuations                                       in turn allows us to secure fuels reliably mitigate fuel price
         traditionally sellers usually take care of the procurement                              fluctuation risks and adjust fuel procurement volume

 message from general manager of fuels department

  we will strive to improve the reliability ﬂexibility and economic efﬁciency of our
  fuel procurement
  chubu electric power is one of japans largest fuels buyers with annual coal purchase of
  about 10 million tons and annual lng purchase of about 13 million tons in ﬁscal 2013 fuel
  costs accounted for approximately 50 percent of ordinary expenses
      in recent years procuring fuels for electricity generation in a reliable and flexible
  manner and at internationally competitive prices has become even more important given
  the necessity of responding to wide swings in fuel volume requirements caused by the
  operational status of the hamaoka nuclear power station the liberalization of the electricity
  market and other factors
      in response to such major challenges to our business we are moving beyond traditional
  fuel purchasing and entering into new ﬁelds such as fuel transportation and trading and
  even lng production
      to fulﬁll our commitment to ensuring stable supply of electricity at reasonable prices        yuji kakimi

        achieving higher energy efﬁciency and better working environment with an
        arctype electric heating system
        aisin takaoka co ltd a manufacturer of automotive casting parts wished to improve the
        energy efﬁciency and work environment in its casting processes to meet the longfelt need by this
        customer chubu electric power collaborated with toyota motor corporation and tokuden co
        ltd to develop an arctype ladle heating system inspired by a ladle preheating system where a
        ﬁreresistant container called a ladle is used to convey casting iron from the melting furnace to the
        molding line
            adopting this arctype electric heating system to replace the conventional system using gas
        burners has led to a reduction in energy consumption of about 75 and in running costs by some
        60 as well as the improvement of the working environment
            in recognition of these achievements we and other codevelopers of the system received an                arctype ladle heating system
                                                                                                                      adopted by aishin takaoka

  message from one of our outside directors

   my expectations toward chubu electric power
   when i took the position of outside director chubu electric power was in the process of
   implementing a management structure reform that involved the reduction of the number
   of directors and the introduction of an executive ofﬁcer system while focusing on fairness
   and transparency as central management issues as the company was undergoing this
   change i felt that my expected role as an outside director was to provide perspectives as a
   person with a broad international view as a general citizen and as a woman i have been
   supporting the innovation of the company from these perspectives ever since
       although the electric power industrys main business arena is japan chubu electric
   power has been actively expanding its presence overseas with a broad international view
   this actually helped the company to quickly procure additional liquefied natural gas             hideko katsumata

energy saving initiatives
improving energysaving functions of the company building
chubu electric powers atsuta building implemented a plan directed
to establish an energyefficient facility with superior environmental
features for the buildings secondary largescale renovation project
after its construction in 1971 specifically the company employed new
codeveloped energy source equipment that is highly efficient within
a wide power range raised efficiency in thermal storage by improving
existing water heater storage tanks and reviewed and optimized air
conditioning operations based on operating hours and usage together
with other improvements we reduced energy consumption of the energy
source equipment and air conditioning system by 54 and achieved a
17 reduction for the entire building compared to the prerenovation
level these achievements were highly evaluated and the building was
given a renewal award by the society of heating airconditioning and
                                                                                                             renovated energyefficient atsuta building atsutaku nagoya city

        exchange opinions with members of the central japan branch of the nippon
        association of consumer specialists nacs
         major opinions of participants
        regarding the explanation on the electricity rate increase to customers             exchanging opinions with consumer specialists
         detailed information is provided in chubu electric powers leaflets and on website
          however most people do not read them carefully i want chubu electric power to provide information in such a way that
          customers can understand the content better and more easily
         chubu electric power should know its information materials and notices contain a large amount of jargon and are hard
          for the general public to understand
        regarding club katene a web service for customers households
         with regard to this service there are many issues to be solved for example membership registration procedures are too
          complex and some services are available only for a limited time
         the service that enables customers to see their past power consumption in a graph format is very helpful i think chubu
          electric power should publicize this service in a more proactive way
        communication efforts regarding important matters such as a nuclear power station
         many people have concerns about unexpected events that might affect the nuclear power station it is preferable that
          chubu electric power discloses information on the risk factors pertaining to the nuclear power station at the time of an
          emergency such communication efforts will help people engage in indepth discussion and gain more understanding
          about the nuclear power station

2 nuclear power backend costs etc
the backend business of nuclear power takes an extremely long time
period and has many uncertainties to prepare for the future backend
costs based on the rules set by the government chubu electric has set
aside provision for reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel and provision for
preparation of the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel
    even so the costs of nuclear fuel cycles including backend costs
may vary depending on regulatory reform changes in estimates of
future expenses mandated and voluntary and the operating status of
reprocessing facilities as a result company performance may potentially
be affected
