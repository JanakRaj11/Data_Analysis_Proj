deployment of even more waterconscious frameworks                               advantage for making a business stronger and also because
the criteria for being a truly global company is not just about                 the success of the overseas offices depends on local human
business internationalization it is about collaborating with local               resources i would like to see toto increase their human

use in expanding improvements in sanitation around the world                     explanation of those results could be taken further i would like to
it is also worth explaining not only about totos activities but                 ask to not just consider design aspects but also systematically
also the activities conducted through collaboration with various                  arrange and report esg activities based on these indicators
stakeholders such as private organizations and public                               because toto is working on developing indicators for
