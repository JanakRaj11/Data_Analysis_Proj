	level 1  the hierarchy in level 1 includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices this includes mutual
  funds that have quoted price the mutual funds are valued using the closing nav

	level 2  the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market like forward contracts is
  determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible
  on entityspecific estimates if all significant inputs required to fair value as instrument are observable the instrument
  is included in level 2

	level 3  if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data the instrument is included in
  level 3 this is the case for unlisted equity securities etc included in level 3

		level 1 level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices this includes mutual
   funds that have quoted price the mutual funds are valued using the closing nav

		level 2 the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market like forward contracts is
   determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as
   possible on entityspecific estimates if all significant inputs required to fair value as instrument are observable
   the instrument is included in level 2

		level 3 if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data the instrument is included
   in level 3 this is the case for unlisted equity securities etc included in level 3

   5 other comprehensive income
		under ind as all items of income and expense recognised in a period should be included in profit or loss for the
   period unless a standard requires or permits otherwise items of income and expense that are not recognised
   in profit or loss but are shown in the statement of profit and loss as other comprehensive income includes
   remeasurements of defined benefit plans the concept of other comprehensive income did not exist under the
   previous gaap

		the transition from previous gaap to ind as has not had a material impact on the statement of cash flows

		under ind as bank overdrafts repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the cash management process
   are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of presentation of statement of cash flows under previous
   gaap bank overdrafts were considered as part of borrowings and movements in bank overdrafts were shown as part
   of financing activities consequently cash and cash equivalents have reduced by  1158 cr as at 31st march 2016 1st
   april 2015   1282 cr
