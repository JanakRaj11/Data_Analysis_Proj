since 2011 a series of accidents and explosions have occurred at chemical plants in japan these accidents have not                for society
only been dreadful for local communities but also had an economic impact by disrupting supply chains toray groups
operations were also seriously affected by these supply problems                                                                   csr report highlight
regrettably toray group itself has experienced more fires and near accidents recently in 2012 the group saw more
of these incidents than in any other year since the fire prevention project started in 1998 in response we launched               csr news

a second phase of the project in june 2012 all toray plants in japan are now carrying out comprehensive inspections
                                                                                                                                    development of science

to conduct onsite inspections of plants thought to be higher risk and review safety best practices from within and

teleconferencing offices and plants in tokyo and mishima chiba tsuchiura and kamakura joined the drills based                  subject index
on a scenario where they also incurred damage this was a valuable exercise in that we confirmed that we are
prepared to respond immediately to an earthquake and that all systems are in place for confirming the safety of                     activities of toray group
employees and collecting damage reports
learning from the drills we created a new management protocol for the earthquake response headquarters which                      our people

also addresses risks from the earthquake projected to occur in the nankai trough off japans pacific coast we will
continue to hold regular drills simulating even greater damage to facilities we are determined to keep improving our
earthquakeresponse measures and business continuity plan in the context of torays overall disaster preparedness

the debt crisis the shale gas revolution in the united states has the potential to transform the countrys economic
structure and continuous growth in china asean nations and other emerging countries is driving progress in the

enable us to succeed

can continuously grow while helping solve the pressing problems of the age with their products and businesses will be
the ones that earn sustainable growth this means that while we vigorously pursue our growth strategy we also
recognize that sustainable business development requires all employees and workplaces to practice corporate social
responsibility csr this is why we are reemphasizing torays longstanding commitment to safety accident

     toray creates a telecommuting program for employees

       in april 2012 toray launched a telecommuting program with the aims of making it easier for employees to
                                                                                                                                       contact us
       work while raising children or caring for family members and making workplaces more dynamic by fostering
       more diverse working styles for employees wanting to telecommute the program allows them to spend a
       portion of their total work hours working from home capped at an upper limit employees can organize their
       schedules according to their individual circumstances enabling them to more effectively balance work and
       family life


     i plan my work in advance to make smart and flexible use of the telecommuting program


       my wife gave birth to twin girls in february 2012 since we already have a
       four year old son i suddenly found myself very busy it became really
       difficult to do both my job and childcare duties so i was struggling to find
       ways to handle everything at the time but right around then i heard the
       news that the company had started up a telecommuting program it was
       perfect timing for us so i took advantage of it and registered right away
       there were several days when i had to stay at home because my wife had
       to leave the house whether to take the kids to the clinic when they were

sick or needed a vaccination or other reasons nevertheless i was able to
take care of my kids and do my work at the same time that is very helpful                                                 58
for me so i use the system to work from home about once a month when
i decide what day to telecommute i plan my work and prepare the items i
need to be able to work from home and use our remote access service1
in this way i try to minimize any inconvenience for my colleagues at work


i hope that the number of employees using the program grows and it
becomes popular in the future so that many people are able to carry out
their work and family duties more effectively

i have been able to spend my time more efficiently thanks to the telecommuting program

i am continuing to work while bringing up two children one is in the first
grade and the other is in preschool so my commute to work which takes
one and a half hours each way is quite a burden for that reason when
the telecommuting program started up in fiscal 2012 it looked very
appealing to me
when i work from home it is not easy to fully understand how work in the
office is progressing or to communicate with my boss and coworkers as
effectively as i would in the office just by using the telephone and email
nonetheless because i have cut down on my commuting time and i can
get some housework done during my breaks in the day quickly pick up my                   yoriko tobiishi
daughter from nursery school and even take a little time to play with my                  clinical development division
kids in the park near my house i feel like i have more time and energy                  toray industries inc
this is a big advantage of the program
events held on weekdays at my sons elementary school have recently
increased so i have to do my job more efficiently therefore i plan to
make more effective use of the telecommuting program in the future i will
continue asking for the understanding of my family and coworkers as i try
to achieve a satisfying worklife balance

  toray group safety record

data on occupational accidents has been compiled by toray since 1980 and by toray group as a whole since 1990
accident information is shared groupwide and is valuable for measures aimed at preventing the occurrence of
similar accidents accordingly group companies in and outside japan have improved safety records to the level
achieved by toray
in 2012 the occupational accident frequency rate including both those resulting in lost work time and no lost work
time per million manhours worked was 012 for toray 027 for subsidiaries and affiliates in japan and 017 for
subsidiaries and affiliates outside japan in the same year the rate of occupational accidents resulting in lost work
time was 015 for toray group as a whole a slight improvement compared to the rate of 016 in 2011 but still short
of the groups target of 005 for this key performance indicator

  enhancing safety and accidentprevention training

toray group incorporates occupational safety and accident prevention training into the curriculums of its specialized
and job gradespecific organizational education programs in addition the group emphasizes handson accident
training by having employees participate in crisis situation simulations to raise hazard awareness
occupational safety simulation trainings are designed to simulate various accidents involving equipment such as
becoming caught or entangled in machinery and rollers getting hit by projectiles or falling objects receiving electric
shocks and experiencing blowouts of gas or liquid during pressure reduction in accidentprevention simulation
training toray has been conducting fire and explosion demonstrations since the mid1970s so that employees can
directly experience the terrible impact such an accident could have toray intends to continue using sophisticated
training methods and programs like these to make a clear impression on employees at its own plants and those of its
group companies

                                                                                                                               61

in 2012 toray its group companies in and outside japan and its subcontractors jointly implemented a safety
initiative for forklift operations the risk of accidents is high in workplaces where forklifts operate alongside people to
separate them spatially the measure calls for safety fences placed around forklift operation areas and to separate
them temporally people are prohibited from entering warehouses during certain working hours

inspections employing a checklist covering fire and explosionrelated items the checklist consists of 906 items
compiled on the basis of lessons the group has learned from past accidents and it has been adopted by group
companies both in and outside japan toray group intends to continue these comprehensive inspections going
forward


    preparing for accidents through fireprevention drills

all companies and plants in toray group are making efforts to improve their disasterpreparedness capabilities by

    initiatives for improving fireprevention capabilities

in recent years a spate of accidents and explosions has occurred at major chemical companies in japan and toray
group has also experienced more fires and near accidents at its worksites in response to these trends toray group
has started a second phase of its fire prevention project which it originally initiated in 1997 in an effort to step up
its disasterprevention capabilities


during the first period of this second phase spanning from june to december 2012 the general manager of torays
manufacturing division led emergency inspections of all production plants emergency inspections of electric power
capacitors and exhaust ducts were also carried out as a measure to prevent the recurrence of the near accidents that
have occurred in recent years in addition an expert committee was set up to bring together the groups employees
and managers who have expertise in disaster prevention
the expert committee is made up of about 40 members who specialize in internal safety of toray group chemical
processes engineering and other fields the committee is organized into six teams responsible for determining tasks
that toray group must take on when performing the following activities

   reassessment of the causes of fires and near accidents that have occurred in toray group
    consideration of countermeasures onsite confirmation of the effectiveness of recurrence prevention
    measures
   establishment of countermeasures for toray group based on case studies of accidents that have
    occurred outside the group
   inspection of procedures for suspending operations in the event of a power or fuel supply interruption
    and for resuming operations at toray groups manufacturing sites with higher fire and explosion risk

the second period of the fire prevention projects second phase commenced in january 2013 accordingly toray
group has drawn from the lessons and tasks undertaken in the first period and is now examining concrete fire
prevention measures in its efforts to continue improving its ability to avoid a major accident

      only economic effects that can be determined with a high degree of certainty are included in the calculation
       presumed effects are not included

       objective capital investment resulting from leases is also included expenses include labor costs and
       depreciation however internal labor costs related to local volunteer activities are not included

   energy cost reduction figures show the amount of reduction for the 12 months after the completion of an
    energy conservation facility expenses are not recorded as they are deducted when the effect is calculated   125
   waste disposal cost reduction figures show the amount of reduction achieved through waste reduction efforts
    and resource recycling for 12 months after the measures are undertaken
   effects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are measured over a 12month period following the completion
    of measures or facilities to conserve energy

  entering india and brazil on a course to expand worldwide

in india toray established toray international india private limited in april 2011 and the toray industries inc
india liaison office in september of the same year in brazil toray restructured and expanded its subsidiary
launching toray do brasil ltda in november 2012 in both india and brazil the markets are forecast to grow rapidly
in the future therefore toray has begun examining the feasibility of expanding operations and manufacturing locally
in these two countries and is also considering from a variety of perspectives the possibility of business tieups with
indian and brazilian companies

toray group has formulated its own principles for considering business
entry into a new country firstly we give importance to collaborative                                                 141
relations with stakeholders in that country secondly we intend to
conduct business over the long term while contributing to the
development of communities finally we actively hire local human
resources and promote the localization of management in the many
regions where the group operates we strive to conduct business while
promoting mutual understanding with local people so that we can develop
trust and work together in partnership to build a brighter future

     using polylactic acid fiber to make land arable and greener

     since 2007 toray group has been employing sand tubes made of
     polylactic acid fiber in a verification project for preventing topsoil
     loss and restoring vegetation in the inner mongolia autonomous
     region of china starting in fiscal 2012 the group began employing
     a method combining the sand tubes and treeplanting to help
     prevent desertification in china and in a new initiative it started
     utilizing roll planters made of polylactic acid fiber to turn denuded
     areas of south africa into arable land

               republic of south africa

     polylactic acid fiber a biodegradable material is used to make roll planters
     these roll planters are filled with local soil and placed on denuded land
     then drip irrigation equipment is set up above them and seeds are planted
     between them the combination of the roll planters which have high water
     retention and the drip irrigation ensures that plants can grow efficiently
     with relatively small amounts of water and fertilizer furthermore the
     simple setup of the equipment makes it relatively easy to convert denuded
     areas into arable land

  switching to nonconventional but sustainable resources

given the prospects of the eventual depletion of oil reserves and resultant energy shortages the development of non
conventional resources is now a major endeavor in this context innovations in mining technologies have enabled
rapid development of new resources in recent years the mining industry is now focusing on a broader range of
materials particularly shale gas and oil commercial production has already begun for this resource as well as coal
bed methane and tight sand gas to mine these resources vast quantities of water are used and disposed as
wastewater after use torays water treatment membrane technologies are being applied to purify this wastewater
allowing recycling



                                         deposits of nonconventional resources




  the need for water treatment membrane technology in the mining process

in the process of mining nonconventional resources vast amounts of
water are injected into the ground and then discharged as flowback
water torays water treatment membrane technology is used to purify
the flowback water so it can be safely discharged or reused toray
products are already being used for flowback water treatment in coal bed
methane mining in australia and shale gas mining in the united states
demand for water treatment technologies is steadily rising as mining
projects make rapid progress in exploiting the huge reserves of non
conventional resources nevertheless understanding that environmental
conditions differ depending on the mining site toray recognizes the
importance of a prompt response to any revision of laws and regulations     torays water treatment reverse osmosis

advanced technologies are necessary for mining tight sand gas and shale gas and oil

 1   drilling
      an advanced technique called horizontal well drilling is used to mine shale formations in which gas and oil
      are trapped
 2   hydraulic fracturing
      large quantities of water are injected at high pressure to produce veinlike fractures in the bedrock these
      fractures allow gas and oil to escape
 3   retrieving the hydraulic fracturing water gas and oil
      the flowback water retrieved after fracturing contains various chemicals necessary for ensuring that gas
      and oil can flow efficiently

torays water treatment membrane technologies are applied to purify the flowback water so that it can be safely
discharged or reused

    highlights of toray groups science education support programs

a total of four distinct programs are currently being implemented for grades five and six at elementary schools and
the first and third year at junior high schools respectively covering two topics scientific experiments and
environmental education toray provided 41 lessons in fiscal 2012 compared to 33 in fiscal 2011 some features of
the programs are described as follows


   extended programs are based on the school curriculum and designed with teachers
   employee instructors are sent to schools and they teach the class together with the school teachers
   teaching materials and other supports are extensive

because the programs focus on linking everyday science lessons to the real world they are effective in encouraging
childrens interest in science

      comment from a program advisor
      technologically advanced companies have a major role to play in preventing
      children from losing interest in science

      science education in japan aims to teach students about our countrys unique
      perspective on nature and to promote harmonious coexistence with the
      environment nevertheless we are seeing japanese children and even adults
      losing interest in science the school system and others are addressing the
      situation but it has yet to significantly improve it is particularly important to

take steps at an early stage when children are in the upper grades of
elementary school but elementary school teachers generally lack confidence in                                         149
their understanding of science since they are generalists expected to teach all
subjects
given these circumstances having company workers visit school classrooms
and talk about actual products and technologies helps children see how the
content of their science lessons is connected to advanced science and
technologies that make a difference in everyday life that helps students to
appreciate just how useful science is and can inspire them to study it further
students also become more interested in jobs that involve the use of science
in that light technologically advanced companies have a big role to play in               masayuki ishii

a look at the experiments


  1 using hollow fiber membranes to filter colored water that cannot be filtered
  through filter paper
  colored water pumped through a hollow fiber membrane via a syringe passes through microscopic pores on the
  wall of the membrane and comes out clear and colorless inside the syringe

                                                                                                                             151




the children are astonished at the results using the hollow fiber            the liquid pumped in the syringe is clear
membrane                                                                     and colorless




the pores of the hollow filter membranes are about 500 times smaller than the pores of the filter paper




2 can saltwater be filtered by a hollow fiber membrane
in the next experiment saltwater is filtered with a hollow filter
membrane the filtered water is then evaporated over a gas burner
when the children observe that the salt remained they are surprised that
the hollow filter membrane is not able to filter it some wonder if
saltwater could be filtered by a membrane with even smaller holes




3 saltwater can be filtered through reverse osmosis membranes
reverse osmosis membranes are introduced in this experiment with the
worlds smallest pores measuring one nanometer one billionth of a
meter in diameter these membranes are used in desalination plants and
other facilities around the world saltwater can be filtered if torays
reverse osmosis membranes are used




                                                                                   students tastetest bottled water made
                                                                                   from seawater filtered through
                                                                                   a reverse osmosis membrane




4 observing microscopic particles dissolved in water
initially the children assume that colored water and saltwater cannot be
filtered because they are liquids but then they change their minds after
observing the filtration experiment through the series of experiments
the students become able to confirm the presence of particles too small
to see with the naked eye including paint and salt inside a liquid



                                                                                   students drew diagrams of the particles
                                                                                   found in the liquid solution based on
                                                                                   the experiment results




5 learning about the relationship between filtering technologies and global
water problems
the instructor explains how the hollow fiber membranes used in the experiments are widely applied in everyday
life for purifying water also describing how water treatment membranes are related to technologies that will
play an active role in solving water shortages around the world often indicating their new interest in the
possibilities of science and technology students exchange opinions a typical comment is that the number of
children in need of clean drinking water could be reduced by making these membranes more widely available

                                                                                                                          152




  comments from students taking the classes

     i learned that salt and paint are actually made of tiny particles im glad that science is so neatfifth
      grader in elementary school
     studying is usually boring because i have to memorize a lot of stuff but in this lesson i could try to
      figure out the questions and consider many mysterious things about chemistry i got motivated because
      it was so interesting firstyear junior high student
     im happy that i could do the experiments with the instructors detailed explanation now i realize how
      useful studying science is for society thirdyear junior high student




                                     teachers evaluations of torays programs



in evaluations conducted afterwards teachers involved in the lessons gave high marks overall to the
programs the instructors from toray and other items some teachers noted that the lesson content was
effectively applied and deepened the childrens understanding of science and that using experiment supplies
not normally seen by children heightened their interest in class all teachers expressed their hope that the
toray instructors will teach again the next school year




  comment from a teacher who participated in the lessons
  torays science classes are a model for collaboration between companies and
  schools

 the instructor from toray was a respectable adult who still interacted with the
 students in a genuine and downtoearth manner not only explaining the
 technical matters the instructor also spoke enthusiastically about work for
 our thirdyear students the instructor sent a positive message about the
 working world in the lesson i could see that a narrative on how school
 classes are connected to science and technology showing how this field
 contributes to society made the class seem more practical for the students
 and helped them learn i think that torays science classes provide a model for
                                                                                             kumiko aoki
 collaboration between companies and schools which can develop alongside

 programs are expanded nationwide




  comment from an employee who taught lessons
  i want to create new addedvalue products that can make childrens eyes
  light up

 i explained to the children about global environmental problems and how
 toray groups advanced materials are useful for society compared to my
 usual work in technical development teaching the students was gratifying in a
 different way many of the students who lacked confidence in science told me
 after the lesson that it seemed to be an interesting subject from here on i
 intend to put all my energy into creating new products that are kids like these
 have never imagined the idea of inspiring kids really motivates me

  hopes for the future

while determining classroom needs and the effectiveness of program activities through questionnaires and other
methods toray aims to prevent children from losing interest in science by utilizing toray groups resources since
employees also grow by participating in the programs toray intends to continue carrying out these educational
programs going forward
