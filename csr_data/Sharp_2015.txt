top message


    be the kind of company society needs and build a business
    foundation geared to sustainable growth

sharp recorded large net losses in fiscal 2014 we deeply apologize for any worry
we may have thereby caused our customers business partners shareholders and
other stakeholders we have begun implementing the measures of our fiscal
20152017 mediumterm management plan which was announced in may 2015

welfare of people throughout the worldwe strive to contribute to society by
making ourselves an integral part of peoples lives and by making these lives better

appropriately and sincerely

in 2005 sharp formulated the sharp group charter of corporate behavior and the sharp code of conduct two
sets of corporate action principles that would allow us to better achieve the goals of our business philosophy and
business creed the sharp group charter of corporate behavior outlines corporate action principles that apply
uniformly across the entire sharp group while the sharp code of conduct contains standards of action to be
followed by all directors officers and employees in january 2015 we revised these two documents in line with
international standards such as iso 26000

in february 2015 we formulated our fiscal 20152017 mediumterm csr strategy under this strategy based on
the level of importance to the sharp group and to society ie the level of stakeholder expectations the entire
sharp group is working as one to address five material issues materiality supply chain csr initiatives respect for
human rights and diversity management 1 increasing green shared value gsv 2 ensuring the safety and

human rights labor the environment and anticorruption we ask for your continued support as we strive to fulfill
our corporate social responsibility through business activities and become the kind of company society needs




1 diversity management involves incorporating the ideas and values of employees with diverse backgrounds with regard to
   gender age or nationality without being influenced by previous corporate or social standards it is a strategy for
  promoting company growth and the personal satisfaction of employees by responding rapidly and flexibly to changes in
  the business environment taken from a report by the diversity work rule study group of the japan federation of
  employers associations
2 sharp places the fulfillment of societys needs regarding environmental matters in close alignment with its strategy for
  business growth with a view to achieving success in both areas sharp defines the value thus created as green shared
  value
3 stakeholder engagement involves dialoging with as many stakeholders as possible in order to understand their
   concerns and then reflecting these concerns in the companys business activities and decisionmaking

management strategy and csr
policy on csr activities

sharps csr has its roots in its business philosophy and business creed sharp divides its csr activities into four
large categories and pursues them while engaging and communicating with stakeholders in order to make sharp
the kind of company society needs

the first category offering innovations through business activities represents sharps objective of pursuing
whatever is necessary to make peoples lives better through accessible products and services it does this by
making the most of its unique technologies fostered over the years and by having an eye for capturing unique
business opportunities in other words sharp is contributing to society by aiming to be a company that consistently
offers new value while putting the customer first

integrating management and csr has become an important theme in the business world against this backdrop
sharp continually offers innovations while carrying out wellbalanced activities in the three other csr categories
harmony with society and collaboration with partners creation and innovation of corporate culture and basic
social responsibility




    mediumterm csr strategy fiscal 20152017

sharp has formulated a mediumterm csr strategy under which it aims to secure the confidence of stakeholders
by contributing to the sustainable development of society while sustainably growing itself through csr
management




in order to achieve this goal sharp will be swift and accurate in grasping information and changes in the business
environment both inside and outside the company it will also identify material issues materiality that the sharp
group should prioritize and it will cooperate closely with relevant departments when implementing policies and
measures

management strategy and csr
csr dialogue

with a growing focus on social issues like the environment and human rights companies pursuing csr corporate
social responsibility must increasingly narrow down their list of targets so they can conduct activities by the most
effective means possible sharp recently hosted a dialogue between yumiko ito executive managing officer in
charge of csr affairs at sharp and katsuhiko kokubu a professor in the graduate school of business
administration at kobe university the two discussed the viability of sharps mediumterm csr strategy be the
kind of company society needs secure stakeholder confidence through csr management and where sharp
must go from here




     sharps identity and concrete measures

katsuhiko kokubu kk       i looked at sharps fiscal 20152017 mediumterm management plan for sharp to
                            renew itself it is important that it revamp its foundations and focus on continuing to
                            provide value to society there is an intricate link between csr and the continuous
                            creation of value thats why i think a mediumterm csr strategy could play the role of
                            supporting sharps management restructuring

yumiko ito yi             the last part of the mediumterm management plan contains a summary of sharps
                            identity sharp has always been highly rated for using its proprietary technologies to
                            develop previously unseen products for many years our slogan at sharp was
                            sharpa creative sharp pointofview now more than ever we need to conjure up
                            this spirit once again and show that we are sharpfocused on technology and that we
                            have a creative sharp pointofview

                            when i think about what we have done up to now and what we have to do from now on
                            i am reminded that we have to bring sharp closer to people by being a company that
                            continues to provide new value and by using our business activities to contribute to
                            society

kk      hearing you say that makes me feel better about sharp
        something else i should mention is how incredibly
        important employees become when business is tough in
        the area of human resource development at times like
        these i think its crucial for sharp to have concrete
        policies on what type of people it should hire and how
        these people should be trained




                                                     11 

                                                                                              sharp sustainability report 2015


yi     youre right one of the material issues materiality of our mediumterm csr strategy involves diversity i
       agree with you that there is much more we could be doing in the area of human resource development
       especially in difficult times like these i think that sharp employees should work with hope and confidence
       and they should be able to exercise their full talents in the course of their work

       to facilitate this we need to create a human resources system in which we give important jobs to talented
       employees regardless of their gender age or nationality and we should evaluate people based on the
       results they achieve this has been one of the key aims of the mediumterm management plan and efforts
       to this end are fundamentally linked to diversity

kk     csr activities used to be based on rules but today they are based on principles while many japanese
       companies believe that nobody will know what to do unless you have rules this is because they have not
       established principles rather in todays world of csr principles are key and without them you cant
       progress with csr i think that such principles are demonstrated by the key phrase in sharps mediumterm
       csr strategy be the kind of company society needs when youre trying to solve problems such as
       diversity or the human resources system you just mentioned you must make decisions by going back to
       these principles

yi     principlebased csr requires that companies examine the problems they face and what they should do
       about them

kk     companies establish targets set kpis  and then take action but its crucial that they have ways to
       accurately monitor and evaluate their actions in a qualitative manner kpis are effective because they
       clearly and concretely illustrate progress the kpis themselves can be ordinary indices in fact whats
       important is a companys willingness to improve the state of things through these indicators as examples of
       indicators you could use the percentage of female managers in the area of diversity or the amount of co 2
       emissions in the area of environmental protection in other words relatively basic indicators however if
       you set kpis they must coordinate with your existing kpis in other areas of the company otherwise
       theres no use calling them kpis by coordinating its csr kpis with financial kpis such as net sales and
       profit targets i think sharp will garner a reputation as a company ready and willing to take on csr issues
        key performance indicators key management indicators for evaluating how well a company achieves it targets



yi     so positioning kpis is an important part of csr regarding csr kpis there is the danger of them
       becoming simply goals unto themselves after setting the kpis if you see that they have strayed from your
       ultimate goals you have tofor examplecompletely change them in line with evolving business targets or
       carry out some sort of pcda cycle




     promoting stakeholder engagement

                                                  yi      we have made stakeholder engagement one of our
                                                          material issues however we have been grappling with
                                                          this issue due to its extensive range and depth can i take
                                                          this opportunity to ask you for some advice on this
                                                          matter

                                                  kk      all companies proclaim that they will fulfill their csr their
                                                          corporate social responsibility however because csr
                                                          means a responsibility to society a company cant really
                                                          be said to have fulfilled its csr when the criteria for it
                                                          were decided by the company itself and not by society


kk     since csr means a companys responsibility to society the company wont achieve its csr goals unless it
       brings on board those people it is responsible to and has them take part in deciding targets and action
       plans in other words a company cant unilaterally decide what constitutes csr while at the same time
       ignoring society and the people it purports to be trying to help in this sense stakeholder engagement is
       crucial to the principles of csr as an important process of incorporating societys opinions however
       stakeholder engagement is still not firmly rooted in japan there are two reasons for this first there are
       very few stakeholders in japan who are confrontational and who have strict demands second companies
       in japan are not all that open to the outside world however these same companies should understand that
       csr means a companys responsibility to society and that it can only be achieved through stakeholder
       engagement and there are many ways to do this

                                                                                              sharp sustainability report 2015


yi       thats interesting it tallies with my awareness of the issue like you say there can be no stakeholder
         engagement until a company opens itself up more to the public
         this sustainability report was written with the hope that our awareness of the issue and efforts to be as
         open as possible to society will enable us to achieve new successes

kk       in sharps case the company can strive for betterment in any number of ways whats important is to get
         started on stakeholder engagement that promotes the appropriateness of the material issues listen to
         stakeholder opinions and then decide what to do next such a feedback process would constitute
         wonderful stakeholder engagement csr could be likened to a window that is open to society besides
         allowing you to reflect stakeholders hopes and expectations in your management the window also makes
         you more sensitive to society by allowing you to gather future riskrelated information i hope that sharp
         makes the most of stakeholder engagement in its renewal

  restructuring the business portfolio


                               the first basic strategyrestructuring the business portfolioinvolves completely
                               withdrawing from underperforming businesses shifting resources to growth areas
                               and approaching new business areas in each business category the objective is for
                               sharp to establish a more stable highvalueadded business structure

                               the two business groups and eight business divisions will be reorganized according
                               to business characteristics into five inhouse companies this will allow sharp to
                               respond more quickly to changes in customer needs and in the relevant market
                               environment the five inhouse companies are consumer electronics energy
                               solutions business solutions electronic components and devices and display
                               devices

                               for the consumer electronics company as we enter the fullscale era of the
                               internet of things iot a salient trend is the growing variety of consumer
                               electronics products that are being connected to the internet being a company that
owns various technologies in television communications and home appliances sharp views this trend as a
business opportunity sharp will propose new connections between people and home appliances that provide
added value and convenience this will involve offering not only hardware but also integrated cloudbased services

sharp will also be designing products under a new design vision that embodies the concepts of beauty and
affection unexpected surprises and an emotional connection with consumer electronics the company will
launch new businesses and products that are based on this new design vision and that make the most of synergies
among the three existing businesses of digital information equipment health and environmental equipment and
communication systems sharp will also focus its management resources in japan and asia and take on new
challenges in this business area centered on health and environmental equipment

for the energy solutions company sharp will shift to a business mode that focuses on solutions that match local
demand in japan and overseas markets for example in japan sharp will propose solutionsbased on solar
power and storage battery systemsthat enable cloudconnected integration of hems 1 energysaving
appliances and ecocute heat pump water heater systems in the united states meanwhile sharp will augment
its range of offerings which currently includes a peakcut system that reduces peak electricity consumption to help

users save on electricity costs throughout its energy solutions businesses sharp will reduce its fixed costs and
aim to regain its earning power

the business solutions company will offer solutions for global markets by leveraging its existing product lineup
and customer base and by making aggressive investments for example in the mfp 2 business sharp will aim to
expand sales by proposing solutions that integrate mfps and it servicesthereby enabling offices to work more
efficientlywhile increasing its aggressive investments in sales routes in the display business sharp will build a
structure that will enable the company to undertake everything from project development to installation and
maintenance sharp will aim for higher profitability by expanding the proportion of total solution sales

the electronic components and devices company will harness its strengths in unique technologies and shift to
areas with high added value these include devices that employ advanced sensing technology to measure distance
or pm25 levels it will also join forces with the lcd business to bring forth an increasing number of valueadded
products such as touchscreen controllers and automotive camera modules

the display devices company will work to acquire a stable customer base and expand sales of valueadded
panels by strengthening its sales and support systems based on sharps competitive edge in this field of
technology for example sharp will expand its b2b2b business targeting the automotive and medical industries
this business area is relatively stable on the other hand the b2b2c businessan area exemplified by
smartphonesis at constant risk of steep decreases in selling prices due to changes in the market environment
for this business area sharp will work to stabilize orders by greatly increasing the number of clients it will do this
by strengthening sales in southern china and by reinforcing design and development collaborations with business
partners

   enables users to monitor the equipments operational status and energy consumption levels as well as control them
   remotely or automatically
2 an mfp multifunction peripheral is an office machine that integrates copier printer fax and scanner functions into one
  unit



  reducing fixed costs


sharps second basic strategy involves decisively reducing fixed costs this will enable the company to strengthen
its capability to better respond to various risks such as a drastic decline in demand or intensifying competition

specifically sharp will establish a streamlined personnel system that matches the new business structure it will
also reform its business structure and bases as an emergency measure to support profitability in fiscal 2015
sharp will reduce personnel expenditure in the form of directors compensation and employees salaries and
bonuses



  reorganizing and strengthening corporate structure and
  governance


sharps third basic policy reorganizing and strengthening corporate structure and
governance will enable each of its businesses to achieve autonomous
management that reinforces management discipline

sharp will shift to an inhouse company system comprising five inhouse companies
effective october 1 2015 the sales departments which are organized in a matrix
structure within each business will be clearly positioned under the control of each
inhouse company this will enable a consistent integrated structure in which the
president of each inhouse company will head autonomous management under his
responsibility on the other hand the sharp corporation head office will maintain
control over each inhouse company so that the entire organization will be able to
respond flexibly to changes in the business environment through speedy disciplined
management

sharp will also change its organization into a flatter simpler one to create a vibrant
corporate climate in which each employee and department can fully exercise their
initiative and demonstrate a sense of responsibility

we believe the key to sharps recovery lies in human resources employees tasked
with important roles will be provided excellent opportunities for growth and
rewarding work conditions with the goal of creating a resilient organization that can

best even the stiffest competition sharps drastic personnelsystem reforms will
involve the following an overhaul of the employee rank and compensation system
efforts to optimize work conditions a move to match personnel placements more
closely with ability and the adoption of a flatter and simpler organizational structure




    sharps future direction

in formulating the fiscal 20152017 mediumterm management plan sharp reexamined its tradition of bringing
forth previously unseen products using its proprietary technologiesa core aspect of its corporate value we
believe it is crucial for sharp to continue creating such corporate value in order to be reborn and to achieve
sustainable growth

looking forward sharp will pursue proprietary technologies keep looking to capture unique business opportunities
and seek whatever is necessary to make peoples lives better through accessible products and services in other
words sharp is committed to contributing to the sustainable development of society by aiming to be a company
that consistently offers new value while putting the customer first




as well as outlining its financial objectives in its mediumterm management plan sharp has clarified its material
issues materiality in the nonfinancial area through its mediumterm csr strategy and it is taking action
accordingly



  the 5 material issues materiality in the nonfinancial area

    1     supply chain csr initiatives

process for identifying material issues in csr




     step 1 classify major csr themes

sharp believes that csr activities should be conducted with consideration for the effects the sharp groups
businesses have on society it also believes that the actual and potential effects of these activities should be
managed

sharp has distilled its major csr themes by analyzing responses to sri  questionnaires by reviewing issues
commonly addressed by other companies and by canvassing the opinions and expectations of sharps various
stakeholders this latter group includes those who are connected with the sharp groups businesses customers
local communities business partners shareholders investors and employees sharp has classified its major csr
themes based on the seven core subjects of the iso 26000 international standard this has been done with an
understanding that the themes are the sharp groups social responsibility and with consideration for the specific
characteristics of each business and the region in which each business is deployed

 sri socially responsible investment investment in companies that fulfill not only their financial obligations but their
  environmental and social responsibilities as well




     step 2 identifying material issues in csr

the major csr themes classified as described above have been
reorganized into csr material issues materiality based on two
axes the level of importance to society level of expectations from
stakeholders and the level of importance to the sharp group
they were then prioritized and mapped out as shown in the
diagram to the right

after a review by the csrcompliance committee which meets
quarterly and which is chaired by sharps president these
material issues were approved and finally decided upon

in fiscal 2015 the following priority material issues materiality
were identified supply chain csr initiatives respect for human
rights and diversity management increasing green shared value gsv ensuring the safety and reliability of
products and enhancing customer satisfaction and stakeholder engagement

supply chain csr initiatives

there is increased awareness by society and stakeholders of social issues affecting the global supply chain such

expectations towards sharp regarding the contribution it should make as a global company to address such
issues the sharp group also recognizes how important it is to fulfill those expectations to respond to

deployment guidebook which conforms with the eicc code of conduct published by the electronic industry
citizenship coalition eicc and the sharp basic purchasing principles we sincerely ask our suppliers to make
their own csr efforts according to the principles and guidebook

further contributions to global society throughout its entire supply chain this will be achieved through regular csr

 customers evaluate the quality of its products our brand image will be enhanced if we continue to provide products
 that exceed the expectations of customers however if we fail to meet such expectations even once our brand
 image will be damaged and cannot be easily redeemed sharp regards quality as the foundation of cs and will
 continue to conduct activities that ensure high quality in every customerrelated aspect of its business including the

last year when i was appointed outside director i expressed my wishes to contribute in some way to sharp
strengthening its corporate governance and boosting performance management and compliance however it
pains me to say that sharp remains in a dire state for sharp to escape this tough situation and be reborn
everyone in the company must act as one and put into practice its business creed of sincerity and creativity on a
daily basis we must also continue to offer society products with the kind of advanced technology befitting products
exclusive to sharp

when an organizations business performance flounders boosting that performance becomes the number one
priority corporate governance and compliance tend to receive less attention than they should there are numerous
cases where placing performance first and foremost leads to scandals in both the public and private sectors
looking over this past year sharp has made steady efforts to enhance governance and compliancesomething i
give the company high marks for i hope to continue to support sharp in these areas as an outside director

    risk management as part of csr

sharp believes it is essential that it control and manage various risks surrounding the company in order to fulfill its
corporate social responsibility which entails meeting the expectations of stakeholders through the sustainable
development of business that is why sharp makes it a priority to conduct brm business risk management as an
integrated part of its csr activities



  functions of the csrcompliance committee


the csrcompliance committee holds meetings to review major risks deliberate on companywide brm
measures for dealing with them and communicate those measures throughout the company in addition the
committee identifies major risks pertinent to sharps business and operations and then plans and promotes
measures to either prevent those risks or minimize their impact

the csrcompliance committee conducts risk management based on a pdca cycle the committee specifies
which priority items sharp should tackle first taking into consideration any risk incidents that have occurred within
the company as well as the measures drawn up by each group or division the committee also clarifies the persons
responsible provides a time frame for tackling those priority items and then checks the progress being made



  promoting brm


  management based on the rules of business risk management

sharp has developed the rules of business risk management as a basic policy for the promotion of brm and
controls its business risks based on these rules in the rules risk items that could have a major impact on
management are identified as specific risks for each specific risk sharp has created a risk control manual and
has designated a business group or division to be responsible for risk management across the entire company
sharp is continuously moving forward with initiatives to minimize risks and to prevent risks from actually occurring

in addition sharp has established the rules of emergency response detailing responses if a major risk incident
does come to pass taking prompt and appropriate action when an emergency situation occurs works to minimize
loss and to prevent the damage from spreading not only across the company but also to society at large these
rules also specify action items to be implemented to ensure prompt and appropriate information disclosure to
stakeholders

sharp periodically reviews and revises these rules and the manual to reflect changes in the business environment
by for example adding new specific risks




                                                      36 

                                                                                                 sharp sustainability report 2015


  management methods for important risks

from among the risks that sharp has designated as specific those that have a greater potential impact and a
higher probability of occurrence are selected as priority risks and they become the subject of intense focus in the
risk management activities of each group or division

each group or division continuously works to deal with these priority risks from the perspective of policy measures
to 1 reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring and 2 reduce the impact on business activities in the unlikely event
that a risk incident actually does occur

for fiscal 2015 sharp will continue focusing on measures aimed at strengthening risk management at its overseas
subsidiaries and at enhancing information management



  promoting bcps

sharps major business sites and group companies have
formulated bcps business continuity plans that assume the
occurrence of emergency situations such as a largescale disaster
or an outbreak of an infectious disease this effort is intended to
expedite the continuation or early recovery of business when such
emergencies occur by regularly reviewing bcps and holding
training sessions sharp works to maintain and improve the
                                                                         a scene from the bcp training session
business continuity capacity of the organization

assistance measures for disasterstricken business sites



                                          bcp basic policy of sharp group

    customer service that exceeds expectations

from the moment a customer first considers buying a sharp product sharps customer assistance center in
japan always aims to meet or exceed customer expectations

all customer assistance center agents operators are periodically monitored by a responsequality manager
based on those results agents undergo training to improve their responsiveness in terms of providing assistance
that matches the customer inquiry as well as their methods of speaking and listening this enables the agents to
maintain a high level of response skills while also boosting their awareness of customer satisfaction

in fiscal 2014 sharp enhanced the support section of its website so that customers can solve problems without
calling the customer assistance center the website provides enhanced customeroriented services that include
fault diagnosis navigation where customers themselves diagnose the symptoms and solve problems by following
instructions on the screen in fiscal 2014 the number of product categories covered such as lcd tvs bluray
disc recorders washing machines air conditioners refrigerators fax machines and phones was increased
theres also the visual guide which employs video images to explain how to maintain productssomething that
can be difficult to explain with just words and illustrations

the customer assistance center has a tollfree number that gives automated responses to help callers solve
common issues this is particularly convenient late at night when customers can receive troubleshooting
assistance even when agents are unavailable

the number of inquiries to the customer assistance center went down after peaking in 2010 this reduction can be
attributed in part to the termination of the japanese governments ecopoint system a system that fueled product
demand and to the end of terrestrial analog broadcasting the ability of customers to solve problems by
themselves using the previously mentioned online support and tollfree number was also a contributing factor

sharp will continue to enhance its support services to help customers solve problems anytime and with ease

cancel function on the same web page

    activities to reflect the voice of the customer in development

since 2009 sharp has been conducting sek 1 service training for engineers involved in product development

the purpose of this training is to let engineers learn about product quality user friendliness and maintenance by
actually visiting service sites directly listening to the opinions of customers and observing how products are
actually used on site in fiscal 2014 new employees in charge of av equipment received sek service training for
five months

sharps engineers rarely have the opportunity to come in contact with customers through this training which has
them directly talking to customers and sometimes receiving harsh comments engineers learn how important it is to
think from the customers perspective and keep the service sites in mind when creating products

in addition by accompanying senior service technicians on their duties trainees learn the necessary social skills
such as interpersonal communication and an eagerness to actively collect information through support services

although only a few years have passed since such service training began employees have sensed that the training
has helped build stronger ties between the aftersales company sek and manufacturing sites including their
development and planning departments sharp will continue to enhance its training program

was revived in january 2015 along with introducing company initiatives and voluntary activities by business sites
and affiliated companies the magazine reports on employees working diligently at their jobs



                       words from an employee involved in editing


this inhouse magazine makes me think about what i should do after reading the messages from the company at
the same time reading articles on employees who take pride in their work inspires me to work harder since i give
the magazine to my family after i have finished reading it my family now has a good opportunity to learn about the
company

in the past i used to casually peruse the magazine as a reader since becoming involved in the editing process i
have had to consider what type of contents readers want to read and how to convey the messages we want to get
across since various people across organizations participate in the editing process we are able to exchange views
while creating the magazine in addition we try to improve the magazine through questionnaires conducted on
sharps inhouse website

going forward i would like to continue producing this magazine while always keeping the readers point of view in
mind and i would like to make every effort to ensure that this magazine evolves into a longlasting sharpfamily
publication

    achievements for fiscal 2014

in fiscal 2014 sharps positive impact ie avoided ghg emissions was equivalent to 27 million tons co 2 down
10 from the previous fiscal year this was due to such factors as a decrease in shipments of solar power
systems meanwhile the companys negative impact ie ghg emissions decreased by 15 from the previous
fiscal year to 17 million tons co 2 this was due to such factors as sharps development of a number of products
with superb energy efficiency such as largescreen lcd tvs

as a result the gsv index the ratio of positive impact to negative impact increased to 16 ie 27 million tons
co 2 divided by 17 million tons co 2

environmental sustainability management
environmental accounting

sharp introduced environmental accounting in fiscal 1999 to provide a quantitative assessment of the costs and
benefits of its environmental conservation activities and is applying the results to environmental sustainability
management




    environmental conservation costs

in fiscal 2014 sharps environmental conservation investment was approximately 23 billion yen and
environmental conservation expenditures were approximately 346 billion yen costs associated with planning and
design research and development made up a large percentage of these figures




    economic benefits

an increase in the positive effects of minimize and recycle waste recycle resources such as the increased use
of recycled water and the expanded recycling of waste into valuable resources was offset by a decrease in the
energysaving effects of reduce ghg emissions global environmental conservation as a result the actual
benefit remained almost unchanged from the previous fiscal year at approximately 25 billion yen

along with establishing guidelines for environmentally conscious design sharp sets assessment standards for the
certification of environmentally conscious products such as lcd tvs and refrigerators and devices such as lcd
modules and sensors every year the company revises these guidelines and standards thus constantly improving
the environmental performance of its products and devices




    developing green products

sharp calls its environmentally conscious products green products gp the gp guidelines which define
development and design criteria in line with seven concepts have been in use at all product design departments
since fiscal 1998

in developing products sharp sets specific objectives according to the gp standard sheet which is formulated
based on the gp guidelines in the trial manufacture and mass production stages it determines how well the actual
product has met these objectives with those achieving the standards being awarded gp status

the content of the gp standard sheetthe benchmark for development objectivesis revised each year in order
to constantly improve the environmental performance of sharp products

  expanding the use of green materials


in line with a green product concept endorsing the use of green materials and devices sharp is promoting the
use of recycled plastic and biomassbased plastic bioplastic

to expand the use of recycled plastic sharp has developed closedloop material recycling cmr technology
which enables plastic to be repeatedly recycled and reused sharps environmental technology rd departments
and product planning departments are collaborating with recycling companies to collect waste materials develop
plastic recycling methods and develop product designs that suit each type of recycled plastic

at present sharp reuses plastic recovered from waste home appliances that are subject to the home appliance
recycling law in japan looking forward sharp will expand the amount of recycled plastic it uses for example by
reusing parts from collected copiersmfps and will expand the scope of recycling across product categories

  developing super green products


since fiscal 2004 sharp has been certifying products that offer a particularly high level of environmental
performance as super green products sgp in fiscal 2013 sharp revised the criteria for this certification
products are certified if they offer classleading energysaving or energycreating performance or if they offer
significantly reduced power consumption through the use of unique sharp technology this way sharp is
aggressively pursuing the development of products that consume as little power as possible as well as developing
highefficiency solar cells

in fiscal 2014 66 product models were certified as sgp sales of those products reached 2246 billion yen with
sgp sales accounting for 351 of all gp sales

    developing green devices

sharp calls its environmentally conscious devices green devices gd to define guidelines for development and
design based on seven concepts sharp established the gd guidelines which it began applying at all device
design departments in fiscal 2004

in developing devices sharp sets specific objectives according to the gd standard sheet which is formulated
based on the gd guidelines and in the trial manufacture and mass production stages it determines how well the
actual device has met these objectives with those achieving the standards being named gd

in fiscal 2013 sharp revamped the gd assessment system by adding new criteria concerning forwardlooking
initiatives that take customer and business partner demands into consideration the degree to which these criteria
are satisfied is represented in points called gd challenge points in april 2015 sharp raised the level of
assessment by adding criteria that are more difficult to achieve sharp will make full use of this system with the aim
of continuously creating devices that have an even higher level of environmental performance




    identifying and reducing environmental impacts throughout the life of
    products

sharp performs a life cycle 2 assessment lca on its products to identify their impact on the environment
throughout their service life converting this impact into co 2 emissions provides a quantitative measure that sharp
uses in its efforts to reduce environmental impacts for example lcd tvs and other consumer electronics have a
large impact during use thus by focusing on improving their energy savings overall environmental impact can be
effectively reduced

to reduce environmental impact in the procurement and disposal stages sharp is lessening its use of resources it
does this by improving product and packaging designs to make products and packaging lighter thinner and more
compact

sharp will continue to develop products with smaller environmental impacts by taking product life cycles into
consideration

maintain existing high levels of environmental performance and raise operational safety levels at sharp factories




  raising the level of environmental performance              maintaining existing high levels




  maintaining environmental performance levels of factories


sharp is maintaining the level of environmental performance at its factories by transparently managing
ecoefficiency in the four key areas of energy waste water resources and chemical substances and by responding
to problems identified at each factory



  raising operational safety levels of factories


sharp has formulated the environmental safety operations guidelines which serve as a guide both to
environmental maintenance procedures mainly in response to laws and regulations and to the appropriate
management of factory infrastructure and environmentrelated equipment the aim of the guidelines is to enable
sharp to respond correctly to the strengthening of factoryrelated laws and regulations and to the deterioration of
facilities and equipment over time

sharp will audit the operational status of the guidelines every year and work to raise operational safety levels
through score management of the audit results

 in lcd factories a large amount of baseload energy 1 is used to run among other things manufacturing
 machines and air conditioning equipment in clean rooms

 at the kameyama plant kameyama mie prefecture japan in response to worsening energy utilization
 efficiency 2 caused by changes in the external environment efforts were made to reduce baseload energy usage
 by strengthening the activities of the energy savings working group this group was established across related
 departments in fiscal 2011 in the three years following fiscal 2011 the kameyama plant carried out 307 energy
 saving activities five of the most effective of these activities were recognized at japans 2014 energy
 conservation grand prize program and were awarded the meti 3 ministers prize energysaving initiatives
 category

 the five actions were as follows 1 installing a heatrecovery system for outdoor airprocessing units 4 2
 optimizing air conditioning in clean rooms 3 changing the operation of cooling towers 5 according to the season
 4 modifying the startup control software for backup fans and pumps used in production equipment and 5
 switching to led lighting inside the factory sharps various efforts resulted in a reduction in energy consumption
 equivalent to 5505 kiloliters of crude oil a yearthe amount of electricity consumed annually by 6800 typical
 households at the same time the kameyama plant was able to achieve reductions in operating costs that
 exceeded the costs of investment thereby contributing both to environmental protection and to better business
 management

 5 equipment to produce cooling water to use in air conditioning


                         words from a manager


throughout the entire kameyama plant we worked to reduce baseload energy use
in order to improve the efficiency of energy utilization which had worsened during
fiscal 2011 going beyond utility equipment such as air conditioning units our efforts
extended to encompass the production equipment used in clean rooms to
manufacture lcd panels

we will strive to further improve energy utilization efficiency by adopting new energy
saving measures

building a resourcerecycling society in fiscal 2014 the amount of waste etc generated by the sharp group
decreased by 4 compared to the previous fiscal year and waste etc generated per production unit was down 6
compared to the previous fiscal year

as a result of ongoing efforts to recycle solid and liquid waste and to recover valuable resources in fiscal 2014
sharp production plants in japan achieved zero discharge to landfill  for the 14th consecutive year with a view to
making even more effective use of resources sharp has set a target of minimizingon a global scaleits final

                                 reducing waste by adopting reusable cargo shiftprevention bands nsec china


in fiscal 2013 nsec a sharp manufacturing subsidiary in nanjing switched from using stretch film ie protective
packaging material that prevents loads from collapsing to using reusable cargo shiftprevention bands for the
transportation of midsize 32 and 40inch lcd tvs in fiscal 2014 after conducting tests to confirm the suitability of
these bands for transporting larger tvs nsec began using them for all tv models with the exception of 90inch
models this effort has resulted in the elimination of 20 tons of waste stretch film per year




  before using stretch film                                    after using cargo shiftprevention bands



                                words from a manager


  it had long been a concern of ours that we used to just throw away used stretch
  film we wanted somehow to be more environmentally friendly and save on
  costs thats why we began using reusable cargo shiftprevention bands after
  carefully testing for any adverse effects on product quality we tried them out
  with midsize tvs then once wed adjusted the length and width of the bands
  we proceeded to use them with larger tv models as a result weve been able
  to reduce waste and costs were looking into other areas where we can use
  these bands so that we can be more environmentally friendly

discharge amount each sharp plant ensures proper management by establishing voluntary standards that are
stricter than those set forth in laws and regulations and stricter than those agreed upon with local communities



  atmospheric emissions in japan




  5 results for fiscal 2012 and 2013 showed an increase
    in nox emissions this was due to measures taken to
    make up for electricity shortages such as raising the
    operating rate of cogeneration systems



  emissions into water areas in japan




  6 results for fiscal 2011 showed an increase in the
    phosphorous pollutant load due to a change in
    production chemicals used at sharp yonago

in cooperation with shipping contractors sharp is working to reduce the environmental impact of its logistics
activities by for example improving transport methods transport routes and load efficiency




    reducing the environmental impact of logistics in japan

sharp observes a rule set forth in the japanese law concerning the rational use of energy energy conservation
law that requires specified shippers to reduce co 2 emissions per shipping volume by 1 or greater per year all
sharp group companies in japan are working to steadily reduce the environmental impact and costs associated
with logistics by improving transport and load efficiencies and by shifting to environmentally friendly modes of
transport modal shift

in fiscal 2014 sharp group co 2 emissions from shipping activities in japan were 24 thousand tons down 22
from the previous fiscal year emissions per shipping volume were 02 tons co 2thousand tonkm an average
annual reduction of 3 for the most recent five years

sharp is steadily shifting from conventional trucking to more environmentally friendly modes of transport such as
shipping noninternational coastal trading vessels and rail japan railways containers due to overall lower
transport in fiscal 2014 the volume of transport by ship and rail was 23019 thousand tonkm down 26 from the
previous fiscal year and sharp was able to maintain the rate of modal shift at 263 and by unloading imported
goods at harbors chosen for their proximity to their main sales locations sharp is reducing retransport between
distribution centers these efforts enable sharp to reduce the environmental impact of its distribution activities

as in fiscal 2013 sharp was certified in fiscal 2014 with an eco rail mark  by the ministry of land infrastructure
transport and tourism and the railway freight association




 products or companies that use a certain amount of rail transport for freight are given eco rail mark certification products
 or companies use the mark to provide consumers a criterion for choosing products

    reducing the environmental impact of international logistics

sharp has a wide range of initiatives to reduce the amount of co 2 that is emitted as a result of international and
intraregional shipping the company is reducing airfreight volume as it switches to environmentally friendly modes
of transport and it is also improving load efficiency further it is reviewing shipping routes and switching to harbors
that are closer to the final destinations for products sharp is also switching to suppliers located closer to its
factories

in fiscal 2014 the co 2 emissions from international and intraregional transport of products and devices produced
and sold by sharp corporation came to approximately 234 thousand tons

sharp recycles products that have reached the end of their service life based on three policies 1 improve the
recycling rate and aim for the effective use of resources 2 improve the efficiency of the recycling system to reduce
recycling costs and 3 incorporate recycling technologies into the development and design of products




    recycling four kinds of home appliances in japan air conditioners
    tvs refrigerators and washing machines

as a member of the b group 1 for home appliance recycling sharp has constructedand is operatinga highly
efficient recycling system consisting of 18 recycling plants in japan

in fiscal 2014 sharp collected about 14 million units of the four types of appliances covered by the home
appliance recycling law this figure represents a 10 decrease from the previous fiscal year reflecting a
compensatory drop and slow recovery in demand following an increase of lastminute purchases prior to the
consumption tax hike of april 2014

for all four appliance types the b groups rate of recycling greatly exceeded the legally stipulated levels it also
meets the new stricter criteria which will come into effect during fiscal 2015 ie recycling rates of 80 for air
conditioners 74 for flatpanel tvs 70 for refrigeratorsfreezers and 82 for washing machinesdryers 2

    effectively using resources and improving recycling efficiency at the
    recycling plant

sharp and kansai recycling systems co ltd 3 are joining forces to make effective use of resources and to
improve recycling efficiency

previously when refrigerators were recycled around 20 of the total weight of insulation urethane in the
shreddingsorting process consisted of shredded plastic by boosting sorting accuracy sharp was able to halve the
amount of this plastic to 10 of the total weight this has also increased the amount of mixed plastic collected by
6 looking ahead sharp will make further improvements to prevent plastic from being mixed in with urethane

for the recycling of washing machines sharp developed and introduced an automatic dismantling device for
motors compared to dismantling by hand this device is 10 faster it also produces highergrade material that can
be shipped to other companies

since fiscal 2001 to promote easytorecycle product design sharp has been conducting designforrecycling
training aimed mainly at personnel responsible for product planning and design in fiscal 2014 26 people took part
in training for recycling lcd tvs and home appliances

this training program incorporated lectures factory tours and exchanges with employees involved in dismantling
operations participants received handson experience in dismantling actual products collected at the recycling
plant at the end of the training participants shared their views mentioning any difficulties they encountered when
dismantling products and discussing how products could be made easier to recycle the knowledge and experience
gained during this training is reflected in the planning and design of new products

  i found this training session to be very informative it gave me an overview of
  the entire recycling process of a product as it is returned to basic materials and
  it also gave me core knowledge on topics such as how to design recycle
  friendly products it also allowed me to actually see recycling in actionfor
  example how products are dismantled and how issues that need to be solved
  are identified i gained a renewed sense of the importance of design
  forrecycling

  i hope to apply the knowledge gained from this training into my work in
  designing washing machines so i can develop products that are even more
  environmentally friendly

    sharps initiatives for a sustainable recyclingbased society

as the company strives to contribute to the creation of a sustainable recyclingbased society sharp considers
environmental friendliness a key factor in all stages of a products life cycle from design to manufacture to disposal
in particular sharp is focusing on recycling materials recovered from used products

in fiscal 2001 sharp succeeded in the practical application of closedloop material recycling cmr technology the
tubs of used washing machines were recycled into material that was used to make new washing machine tubs
this technology has since been improved over the years to enable recovered plastic to be recycled repeatedly and
reused in parts of new products for example as shelves and vegetable compartments in refrigerators and rear
cabinets in flatpanel tvs

in recent years sharp has been engaged in developing technology to recycle scrap glass discarded during the
lcd panel production process into highly functional paint and into zeolite a material that can purify water in fiscal
2014 sharp began experiments to verify the water purification effects of zeolite synthesized from waste lcd panel
glass with the number of discarded flatpanel tvs expected to rise greatly in the future sharp is focusing its efforts
on the recycling of lcd panels a key component in such tvs

    developing technology to recycle lcd panel glass into new material

having noticed that a portion of lcd panel glass constituents is similar to zeolite sharp went on to conduct joint
research with osaka prefecture university on a technology to synthesize zeolite from lcd panel glass as well as
being used as a catalyst zeolite has many other functions including those involving ion exchange and adsorption
recently zeolite has been attracting attention as an environmental purification material that can help purify water
and improve soil quality

in fiscal 2012 the joint research team succeeded in developing basic technology for forming zeolite on the surface
of lcd panel glass this involves using crushed scrap glass discarded during the lcd panel production process
sharp successfully massproduced this material on a kilogram scale starting in fiscal 2014 it began experiments
to verify the water purification effects of zeolite produced this way

in fiscal 2015 sharp will introduce prototype massproduction equipment to manufacture zeolite on a 100kilogram
scale and it will work to expand the volume of zeolite synthesis sharp will move forward on the practical
application of this technology and study its application in the recycling of lcd panel glass in flatpanel tvs

protecting biodiversity

under the sharp group policy on the sustainable support of biodiversity the sharp group carries out a
multifaceted approach in which it protects biodiversity through business activities and social action programs at
worldwide bases




    biodiversity protection through business and social action programs

biodiversity refers to the existence of a variety of ecosystems species and genes with the modern worlds
environmental pollution more and more species are becoming extinct and ecosystems are in danger

while sharps business activities impact biodiversity the company also benefits from the resources that biodiversity
provides that is why sharp is promoting activities to protect biodiversity and exploit it sustainably

based on the sharp group policy on the sustainable support of biodiversity sharp formulated the sharp
biodiversity initiative in november 2009 the initiative describes biodiversity in an easytounderstand manner and
it outlines concrete measures for business activities and social action programs that take biodiversity into account

in fiscal 2014 sharp continued to implement various measures based on the sharp biodiversity initiative while
each sharp base conducted various activities geared to its specific circumstances

the tenri plant tenri nara prefecture is cultivating sasayuri lilium japonicum a flower species indigenous to the
tenri kofun sharp forest located within the factory grounds sasayuri bamboo lily is a wild lily native to japan it
is very difficult to cultivate it takes a year and half to germinate from seed to sprout and five to seven years to
flower

in the spring of 2009 two sasayuri plants were found growing wild in the tenri kofun sharp forest the tenri plant
began a project of protecting the lilies and expanding the areas where they could flourish the project involves
obtaining seeds from the plants capsules  sowing them in a designated area removing weeds from around the
lilies and setting up and maintaining a fence around the growing area

flowers were successfully produced from sowed seeds for the first time in june 2015 the tenri plant will keep up
its efforts to protect the local natural environment and pass it on to future generations




          harvesting seeds from a capsule                           the first sasayuri to be cultivated by the tenri plant

 a capsule is a type of fruit composed of two or more carpels at maturity the dry fruit splits apart and releases the seeds
 contained inside




                             releasing crabs into the sea for ecosystem conservation smtl thailand


smtl a manufacturing subsidiary in nakornpathom thailand
conducts environmental protection activities as part of its annual
company outing

in fiscal 2014 200 employees took part in an activity that involved
releasing about 200 crabs into the sea in a government
designated nature reserve crabs live in holes that they dig in the
ocean floor their digging draws oxygen into the soil which
increases the activity of microorganisms that work to decompose
organic matter and generate minerals this in turn helps to                    releasing crabs into the sea
preserve the natural environment

such environmental activities which have become something of a tradition at smtl provide an excellent
opportunity to boost employees awareness about biodiversity protection

                           words from a participating employee


  thailand has some of the most abundant and diverse coastal ecosystems in
  the world but recent years have seen much destruction of these ecosystems
  looking to the future climate change in particular will have an increasing
  impact on coastal ecosystems it is therefore becoming ever more important to
  restore these ecosystems or create new ones everyone should realize this fact
  and cooperate accordingly

  ive been interested in this activity ever since i first heard about it and today i
  was one of the participants who released crabs into the sea i feel very proud to
  have been part of this initiative it was an activity that everyone who was there
  enjoyed i will continue to take part in other environmental preservation

    compliance with antitrust laws

sharp has made antitrust laws in particular a priority area and is working constantly to ensure compliance with
them in august 2013 the japan fair trade commission finalized its cease and desist order and surcharge
payment order both of which were issued in 2008 against sharp regarding an alleged lcd module cartel in
response to that sharp reorganized its existing antimonopoly act manual and formulated the antimonopoly act
compliance manual action guidelines these guidelines serve to strengthen companywide awareness of
compliance so as to prevent any repeat of such violations of the antimonopoly act in addition sharp implemented
an online training program in antitrust laws for all employees in japan conducted training at every sharp business
site and affiliated company and reviewed the answers submitted by sharp employees for the checklist in its internal
control selfcheck system to comply with antitrust laws in japan which prohibit the formation of cartels




    compliance with laws related to fair advertising practices and proper
    representations

sharp is taking the following measures to ensure proper representations through compliance with laws and
regulations regarding fair advertising and publicity activities the act against unjustifiable premiums and misleading
representations and labeling under the fair competition code

 1 establish a dedicated team to check the representations made in brochures ads and other such materials prior to their
    release
 2 establish an inhouse review system to deal with any questionable representations for example set up a
   companywide committee on fair representations headed by a general counsel to make final decisions on what to do
   with questionable representations
 3 hold regular inhouse training on the act against unjustifiable premiums and misleading representations and the fair
    competition code
 4 appoint an outside expert as a parttime corporate advisor to obtain objective guidance and advice on issues and
    matters requiring consultation related to representationslabeling

in addition to these measures sharp is fostering awareness among its employees on preventing violations of these
laws and regulations by ensuring that representations are in accord with inhouse standards and checklists as set
forth in inhouse rules and guidelines the company is also using a dedicated website on its corporate intranet to
support skill development in personnel in charge of representations

sharp will work on an ongoing basis to further strengthen its checking system in japan and abroad while also
enhancing related policy measures the company will continue to ensure compliance with representationlabeling
laws as well as laws and regulations governing fair advertising and publicity activities aimed at stakeholders
particularly customers

intellectual property


    intellectual property strategy and management system

sharp regards its intellectual property strategy as one of its corporate strategies and it is promoting it together with
its business strategy and rd strategy by defining core technology areas with respect to each business and by
allocating engineers or researchers who have extensive familiarity with patents in each core technology sharp is
strategically filing patent applications that are tightly coupled with its business development this ensures the
companys superiority in each business area and strengthens its business base

in addition sharp is also acquiring useful patents invented in cooperation with other companies or derived from the
activities of alliances such as industryuniversity cooperation

as of the end of march 2015 sharp held 18137 japanese patents and 23343 foreign patents in addition sharp is
filing applications and registering rights for designs and trademarks globally under its brand strategy


                                   end of march 2013                end of march 2014           end of march 2015

    protecting intellectual property

sharp is firmly committed to protecting its own intellectual property rights which form the basis of its business
activities while also respecting the intellectual property rights of others while sharp takes an amicable approach to
resolving issues of infringement it is the companys policy to seek the judgment of a third party such as the courts
when its intellectual property rights are not respected

by strengthening inhouse rules sharp is also working to bolster protection for trade secrets and to prevent
unauthorized disclosure of production technologies and manufacturing knowhow particularly those that are unique
or critically important to sharp

further counterfeit sharpbrand products have had a growing impact in overseas markets in recent years and
sharp is taking measures to counter these imitations through cooperation with industry groups and with regulatory
authorities taking enforcement actions




    incentives for employee inventions

to comply with the intent of article 35 of japans patent law sharp consulted with employees before stipulating its
inhouse rules called the regulations for employee inventions the regulations include detailed standards on
rewarding an employee who comes up with an invention while on the job and hands over the right to obtain patents
for that invention to the company

sharp also reviewed and revised compensation systems in subsidiaries and affiliated companies in japan and
overseas according to the intent of the patent law in each country and it has come up with programs that improve
incentives for employees who devise inventions in this way sharp has built and is promoting systems to
compensate employees fairly and appropriately depending on the contribution their invention makes to the
company and on the contribution that each employee involved made to the invention

    anticounterfeit actions

sharp has implemented the following two main initiatives to combat counterfeit goods

    1 when counterfeit goods are traded within the national borders of a country sharp will petition local law enforcement
       agencies to crack down and will hold training workshops for officials sharp will also cooperate with other companies
       in the same business area to expose the goods
    2 when counterfeit goods are moved from one country to another country sharp will petition local customs authorities
       to crack down and will hold training workshops for officials

sharp will continue its efforts against counterfeit goods through these actions

fully complying with export and import control


    export control

in japan sharp has been among the first in the industry to remain steadily engaged in export control ever since the
days of the cold war when cocom regulations were in effect in the past it was obvious which cuttingedge
technologies should be put under control but today with the advance of technology there is an increasing number
of cases of consumeruse technologies and products being diverted for use in a military or weaponry context
manufacturers are required to pay the utmost attention when exporting products and components and transferring
technologies in addition north korean missiles and nuclear threat irans nuclear development the crisis in
ukraine terrorist attacks in various regions by groups like the socalled islamic state and other such issues have
put global security in an unpredictable statenecessitating the implementation of even stricter export control

when exporting goods and transferring technologies from japan to other countries japanese companies are
obliged to comply with laws and regulations related to export control such as the japanese foreign exchange and
foreign trade act foreign exchange act each sharp group company including domestic and overseas
subsidiaries has a system in place for secure export control based on the sharp code of conduct and sharp
compliance program on export control through this system sharp strictly monitors goods and technologies that
fall under local export control regulations while rigorously screening the destination and the end use of sharp
products and technologies to ensure that they will not be used in a military or weaponry context

in addition to observing the foreign exchange act companies must comply with the export administration
regulations of the united states  on reexporting usorigin products these regulations are also applicable in
countries outside of the us and sharp is working to comply with these regulations

sharps multifaceted approach to export control has so far resulted in no violation of laws and regulations on export
control

when supplying regulated goods to a customer in japan sharp informs the customer that those goods are
regulated if a customer inquires whether goods or technologies are regulated sharp will issueupon the
customers requesta certificate indicating whether or not the goods or technologies are regulated

the key to sharps stringent export control is education sharp has various education programs that foster
employee awareness of export control it provides elearning sessions to all employees whose work is related to
export control and also offers them to employees whose work does not directly involve export control as a means
to get them acquainted with the matter sharp also provides group training for employees being transferred
overseas and for employees being assigned to new positions related to export control

ever more countries are establishing laws and regulations pertaining to export control and the importance of export
control is growing worldwide for this reason sharp is working to strengthen its system for export control while
also enhancing its ability to disseminate information aimed at preventing any violations of laws and regulations

sharp will maintain this policy and system for export control and work to contribute to secure export control on a
global basis

 the us restricts the reexport of usorigin products to a third country the regulations have an extraterritorial effect outside
  the us so there is the possibility that the us government will impose a penalty on parties that violate these regulations

measures among suppliers sharp created its own sharp supplychain csr deployment guidebook this
guidebook was distributed and made available on the sharp website

around the world step up their efforts in areas related to csr

suppliers fill out csr procurement surveys based on this guidebook

an article on csr initiatives that requests adherence to the policies stipulated in the guidebook the company
worked steadily to reenter these agreements with domestic suppliers in fiscal 2013 and it is currently working to
deploy relevant initiatives with its overseas suppliers in april 2015 sharp revised the content of its guidebook to
conform with the eicc code of conduct  a global standard for the electronics industry sharp is working to further
promote csr initiatives throughout the entire supply chain

plants additional thirdparty audits by external audit organizations were conducted as a way of ensuring more
effective csr auditing these csr audits were carried out in response to changes in the external and internal
environments such as revisions to international csr standards

no violation of laws or serious noncompliance was found during the audits after holding onsite discussions with
suppliers regarding areas that did not meet sharps expectations or that required greater effort sharp made a
variety of requests for improvement

in the democratic republic of the congo drc the environmental destruction and inhumane acts against local
residents perpetrated by armed antigovernment militia forces have become a major international issue

minerals such as tantalum tin tungsten and gold mined illegally in the drc and adjoining countries have become
a source of financing for the armed antigovernment militias and hence these minerals are called conflict
minerals with the establishment of the conflict minerals provision of the doddfrank wall street reform and
consumer protection act in the us in july 2010 and the declaration of the due diligence guidance for responsible
supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas by the oecd companies that use these
minerals for the manufacture or functionality of their products are being strongly urged to conduct their activities
appropriately in an effort to cut off funding to such armed forces

  promoting childcare leave for male employees

to create a more employeefriendly workplace sharp has made efforts to establish a support system and
environment in which both male and female employees can participate in child rearing in light of japans low birth
rate diversifying work and life styles and increase in doubleincome households sharp has revised its childcare
leave system to promote child rearing by male employees as a result for the past few years approximately 150
male employees per year have taken childcare leave so that they could take part in child rearing sharp will
continue to support its employees active participation in childcare and in family life with their children



                        words from a male employee who experienced childcare leave


since i joined sharp ive been in charge of developing displays for new products such as tvs mobile phones and
portable games actually im mainly involved in developing display technology for smartphones and tablets

i have two sons and a daughter born in 2007 2011 and 2013 my wife and i looked into details of the childcare
leave system and decided that i would take childcare leave each time one of my children was born

during my leave periods i put all my efforts into child rearing and housework i learned how hard it can be for a
housewife as so many things dont go as planned when i took my second period of childcare leave i could also
help out with my elder childs homework it was good to see how he was doing at school being in a different
environment and situation from work helped me broaden my perspective as well as grow as an individual

i try to be open and regularly share details about my daily work and operations before taking childcare leave i
shared as much information as possible with my department coworkers others in the department followed my lead
in taking childcare leave and i think we have now established in our department a culture that naturally promotes
this approach

i believe its important to maintain a worklife balance not just for child rearing but also when it comes to sharing
housework however if fathers are to take a bigger role in the home there has to be more balance with the office
workload along with our own efforts we have to work closely with our bosses coworkers and department
members while helping each other out childcare leave has taught me a great deal we can encourage more male
employees to participate in child rearing by taking the lead in using childcare leave and also by sharing such
experiences with others and encouraging others to try taking childcare leave

                       words from a disabled employee


since joining sharp ive been in charge of developing spacemeasurement
techniques using cameras at the communications and video technology research
center since i have difficulty hearing i used to have a hard time keeping up with
discussions at large meetings in my current workplace theres a rule requiring that
minutes be created after each meeting which helps me to keep up to speed with
whats going on sometimes i have difficulty hearing even during facetoface
conversations at such times i dont hesitate to ask the other person to repeat what
he or she said and i try to stand closer to someone who is speaking from a
distance

i try to keep up good communications with my coworkers for example ill ask for
advice when i encounter difficulties with my research rather than simply keeping
them to myself i try to enhance my knowledge by using sns to interact with people
who have different expertise from me and i take part in exhibitions and collect
information as part of my research this helps to prevent me from being intimidated
by my more experienced coworkers

my work is very rewarding especially when our team comes together to present our
research achievements or hold demonstrationseither inhouse or at an outside eventand get feedback from
others only three years have passed since i joined sharp and im keen to catch up quickly to my coworkers id
also like to expand my knowledge as a researcher and be able to take a multifaceted approach to resolving issues

to the improvement of products and services such new findings can directly and
indirectly contribute to employees fulltime work by inspiring them to rethink their
work style
