identity and
corporate
responsibility
we produce energy and create value reliably and responsibly
in the forty years during which motor oil has been operating as an oil refiner and oil products marketing company it has
always functioned with a strong sense of corporate responsibility aiming at sustainable profitability and development in a
socially responsible manner combining a progressive approach to corporate responsibility with an efficient business model
competent people and management motor oil is on a course of continual growth and value creation for all stakeholders
while it effectively fulfils its social role enhancing its contribution to society and paving the way for its future development

its corporate vision and mission provide the framework within which the planning and implementation of motor oils
dynamic growth is achieved moreover its operation is founded on a set of firm principles and values that underpin its
business activity

2012 was an important year for motor oil which managed  in the midst of the economic crisis  to achieve a fifth successive
year of record fuel sales and production 117 and 102 million mt respectively

during the year the refinery operated at an increased level of refining capacity producing 185000 barrels a day while also
keeping costs down through implementation of the companys spending control programme

additionally the company also exploited to the full its export capacity achieving once again  despite the continuing fall in
consumption of petroleum products in the domestic market  a total volume of sales significantly in excess of the refinerys
annual production capacity in 2012 overseas sales including shipping and aviation accounted for 725 of the companys total
volume of sales compared with 678 in 2011

there was also a significant increase in our share of the domestic market despite the dramatic fall in consumption because of
the crisis this is thanks to the high performance of the coral and avin oil service station networks which suffered much less
than the rest of the market from the general decline in sales volumes

finally regarding our financial overview the creation of robust cash flows allowed on one hand an uninterrupted funding of
our increased turnover and operating activities while on the other hand reduced significantly our bank debt

7 managing corporate responsibility
motor oil group operates in the energy sector primarily in oil where the principles of corporate
social responsibility and sustainable development ie development that meets current needs without
jeopardising the availability of resources for future generations need to be meticulously applied and
respected particularly so in this sector since crude oil from extraction and transportation to refining
and use of refined products has environmental effects that must be effectively managed utilising
available technology

in implementing the principles of corporate social responsibility we seek
 to achieve a balanced approach to the economic social and environmental impact of the groups
  operations
 to create value for our shareholders while also serving the interests of other stakeholders
 to show concern for our employees and for society at large

we fully acknowledge the importance of these issues and demonstrate our corporate responsibility by
our commitment to pursue our business activities with due respect for people the environment and
society a natural consequence of this commitment is that we adopt a holistic approach to implementing
corporate social responsibility principles by considering the protection of the environment and
fulfilling our obligations to all stakeholders  our employees shareholders customers suppliers and
society as a whole

motor oil has adopted a corporate responsibility management model that incorporates the four
sectors of action included in corporate social responsibility programmes as they moreover arise from
the un global compact and the internationally accepted global reporting initiative gri

there has been a shortage in greece up to 2010 and europe overall moreover the hydrocracker
complex has afforded more flexibility to the refinery allowing the maximisation of either diesel or
gasoline production according to seasonal demand

the rest of the capital investment programme was focused on the technical upgrading of the refinery
on vertical integration automation energy selfsufficiency and environmental protection as a result
it is now considered as one of the most complex and technically advanced refineries in europe and
worldwide based on the nelson complexity index achieved which is 104

the groups investment expenditures in 2012 amounted to 676 million euros and involved in relation
to the refinery replacement and maintenance of existing equipment in order to increase and improve
production capacity and enhance safety and environmental protection


         operational optimization study

    completion of the programme of organic growth for the refinery necessitated the identification
    of areas of operational improvement in relation to operating procedures and optimization of the
    production process

    the work of preparing the relevant study evaluating the operations of the motor oil refinery
    in various sectors as well as identifying possible means of improvement was assigned to kbc
    process technology ltd a firm of consultants with a global reputation in the petroleum industry

    the study conducted in 2012 involved an inventory of the current state of motor oil operations
    in the following areas selection of raw materials refinery programming waste management
    efficiency and operations of the refinery units and energy efficiency the findings of this inventory
    were compared with best practices in the sector and recommendations were then drawn up for
    improvements in procedures and processes

    when the study was complete a special team was set up to analyze the findings and implement
    short and longterm actions based on technicaleconomic specifications by way of example
    one might mention actions resulting in improved management of the refinery tanks increased
    efficiency of processes and minimization of unit energy consumption finally in the context of
    ongoing monitoring and improvement of refinery operations further development was seen in the
    areas of energy optimization and simulation models for refinery processes

our commercial companies
the groups commercial companies have integrated systems for serving the thousands of customers
who place their trust in them every day

more specifically they have full quality and quantity control systems for their fuels quality controls
are carried out on fuels at all stages of transportation from the refinery or the depot to the retail
stations with the support of our specialised chemical laboratories as well as the special vans which
carry out unannounced checks at our retail stations we take active steps to ensure the quality of our
products

in 2012 the companies coral and avin oil introduced new stateoftheart minivans which travel
around greece carrying out thorough quantity and quality controls these are usually unannounced
and cover all the companies retail stations for 2012 1866 visits were made to the groups retail
stations all across greece

moreover once a year our companies carry out market research on a large sample evaluating data
on levels of service fuel quality customer selection criteria etc

in addition to this shell retail stations may also be visited in the course of shells global
mystery motorist programme which evaluates service and customer satisfaction by
means of a specific questionnaire key areas assessed are efficiency of the service
station levels of service cleanliness and speed of transactions in 2012 some 2500
secret visits were carried out at shell service stations the results of these are presented
to the management of the retail dept of coral which in turn discusses them with the
retail station managers and takes corrective measures where necessary

furthermore in 2011 coral introduced pioneering molecular marker technology into all
the differentiated shell fuels the molecular marker is introduced in infinitesimally small
quantities can only be detected using special instruments cannot be removed or altered
and thereby allows identification of fuels with exceptional accuracy

as part of its efforts to ensure quantity control coral has also introduced its special
smart ring for deliveries of heating oil the pioneering smart ring is an innovative
method of electronic quantity control it contains the customers unique details and the
process of supplying fuel using the ring has been designed to avoid any divergence in
quantity between the order and the actual amount received by the customer making it
the most reliable and technologically advanced system for controlling quantity during
delivery

coral gas  true to its vision of being the leading liquid petroleum gas lpg company in
the country  was the first company to bring to greece lpg tanks with the special flow
limiter valve flv the flv bears the π certification of compliance with eu standards
a special protective mechanism is placed within the tap which limits the flow of gas
from the bottle in the event of a serious leak in the network or if the tap should become
stuck in the open position the coral gas tanks therefore raise safety levels and improve
protection for the consumer representing the most uptodate solution for all domestic
and professional uses of liquid gas

finally all our companies have integrated customer service systems using call centres
and emails our customer service centres deal with more than 200000 calls each year
also responding quickly and flexibly to several thousand requests from customers and
final consumers

2 equal opportunities and human rights
all aspects of human resources management are pursued with transparency and are based on
meritocracy

we offer a workplace of no exclusions in which all are treated fairly and are offered equality of
opportunity and where diversity is valued

recruitment transfers promotions pay and benefits education and training etc are governed by the
principles of our equal opportunities policy the avoidance of any form of discrimination and respect
for employees dignity

in applying the equal opportunities policy we strive to ensure
 that the composition of management reflects the composition of the workforce
 that education and training programmes are available to all personnel in accordance with business
  needs
 equal pay for men and women

we support efforts to create an inclusive society where those with special needs are protected
not simply through the provision of welfare but primarily through efforts made for their productive
integration into society thus we offer jobs to disabled people providing them with access to
employment education and professional development

motor oil fully respects international principles of human rights in particular those set out in the
united nations declaration of human rights and in the un global compacts ten principles to which
we are signatories the group is opposed to any practice which might encourage the imposition of
any form of forced or child labour it complies fully with national legislation on child labour there
are no instances of forced or child labour anywhere in the groups activities nor would they be
acceptable it should be noted that all motor oils activities take place exclusively on greek territory
and the relevant greek labour law that it complies with is consistent with the requirements of the
1998 declaration of the international labour organisation ilo on fundamental principles and
rights at work with references to the greek constitution and labour law the greek legal provisions
include two conventions concerning the protection of freedom of association and the right to collective
bargaining



3 labour relations  relations with trade
unions
at motor oil the terms and conditions of employment are regulated by a collective labour
agreement which was drawn up in september 1974 and is approved by the labour ministry at
the end of 2012 964 of group employees were on openended contracts employees are free to
participate in trade unions and professional associations without any restriction refinery employees
are represented through their trade union and the health and safety committee

the union has had a collective labour agreement with the hellenic federation of enterprises since
1986 this agreement lays down the terms of employment and pay levels at the refinery since 2006
there is a company collective labour agreement between the company and the union that gets
renewed every year and is then submitted to the labor inspection unit dept of corinth

                         we believe that smooth cooperation between the company and the employees union is extremely
                         important  particularly so in difficult times like the present when we are experiencing the effects
                         of the severe economic crisis

                         we therefore hold regular meetings with union representatives the common aim being to ensure
                         harmonious bilateral relations avoid disputes and preserve labour peace while continuing to achieve
                         improvements in working conditions

                         the motor oil group as a result of its capacity in pursuing successful business growth
                         opportunities and through effective management has become one of greeces most important
                         dynamic and consistent employers

of                       in 2012 the size of the combined human resources of the group motor oil avin oil coral coral
permanent                gas and ofc  averaged over the year  was 1814 employees the comparative diagram shows
                         a reduction by 114 employees since the previous year owing mainly to retirements prompted by
employees                change in the legislative framework it should be noted that the 2010 figures were up significantly on
over the last            preceding years mainly because of inclusion in the groups workforce of employees of coral and
six years               coral gas following completion of the acquisition of these two companies

                         in addition to personnel directly employed by the companies of the group a significant number are
                         indirectly employed through subcontractors undoubtedly therefore our business activities create a

                         length of employment and turnover of employees
                         as far as the length of service of the personnel with the group is concerned the average was 145
                         years in 2012 compared to 141 in 2011 139 in 2010 142 in 2009 and 146 in 2008 indicating a
                         relatively low rate of staff turnover with 51 of the workforce staying with the group for more than ten
                         years and only 21 having fewer than five years service

                         these figures indicate a healthy balance in the service profile of our personnel combining the
                         experience of older employees with the renewal and dynamism brought by more recent recruits
                         in addition the low rate of labour turnover demonstrates the extent of employee loyalty to and the
                         strength of ties with the group which is one of our main competitive advantages

                         the low level of turnover of employees in 2012 which was 59 is a reflection of the reciprocal
                         confidence between staff and management and the commitment and level of job satisfaction of
                         our employees

                         longterm employment at motor oil is rewarded by additional salary increments in addition at the
                         refinery at coral and at coral gas  commemorative gifts of value are made to employees completing
                         periods of long service these gifts vary from company to company and are relevant to the years of

             1 health and safety management framework
             health and safety at work and the prevention of occupational hazard is a moral obligation and a
             business necessity which goes beyond the narrow limits of a simple legal obligation our principal
             concern arising from our health safety and environmental protection policy is to take all necessary
             measures and to implement all appropriate projects and programmes in order to achieve our
             established goals for health and safety in the workplace which are laid down as follows
              to minimize the risk of major accidents to the lowest possible level
              to eliminate occupational accidents  goal zero
              constant monitoring and upgrading of the quality of equipment so as to ensure that conditions
               conducive to safe work operations are continuously improved
              effective protection of people our personnel contractors personnel our neighbours associates and
               site visitors as well as the environment and our own installations from the hazards that may arise
               from the companys activities
              effective training of personnel and continuous efforts to establish a culture of safe working
              full compliance with regulatory requirements

             at the refinery delivering on this commitment relies on the effective operation of the integrated health
             and safety management system which is certified compliant since 2008 with the internationally
             recognised health and safety standard ohsas 180012007

             the operation of the health and safety management system is assigned to the refinerys health
             safety and environment section moreover the health and safety organisation includes inhouse
             safety engineers occupational physicians and nursing staff  both at the refinery and at motor oils
             head office  at a level that goes beyond the requirements of the relevant greek legislation law
             38502010

             there are also two statutory committees
             	the safety and environment committee whose members include refinery section heads
             	the fivemember employee health and safety committee set up under law 38502010 whose
               elected members are appointed every two years by the refinery employees

             the above committees are intended to oversee control of health and safety conditions making
             recommendations for changes and improvements as necessary

             similar arrangements operate in the other companies of the group taking appropriate account of the
             particular conditions of each workplace

             during 2012 our efforts to achieve our health and safety goals were focused on the following
              continuing upgrading and improvement of directives and procedures
             	investments in upgrading of personal protective equipment
             	implementation of groundbreaking plans to upgrade the safety culture particularly among
               production maintenance and distribution staff
             	investments in upgrading of and improvements in operating equipment

             the extent to which the health and safety management system operates successfully is reflected
             in trends in the most important safety indices ie the number frequency and severity of losttime
             injuries which have shown a clear downward trend over time

             the lost time injuries frequency index has been particularly low in recent years standing at 13 in
             2012 down significantly on preceding years

             at the refinery the ltif index declined to 18 in 2012 from 22 in 2011 while the target for 2012 had
             been set at 25 this decline is due to the fact that the refinery had one accident less than the number
             in 2011

             it is also important that we study the value of the lost time injuries severity index which stood at 03
             on the group level compared with 08 in 2011
             at the refinery the indicator stood at 035 these figures in combination with the steady drop of
             the last 20 years indicate a demonstrably improvement and a proximity towards the target of zero
             accidents

             although the lti and ltif indices are within the targets set and the overall trend is downward
             the groups management is offering steady support to programmes to educate the workforce
             and to strengthening technical and organizational measures to ensure we remain committed to
             our zero accidents objective

             losttime injuries ltis were thoroughly analysed so as to identify causes and the preventive
             measures that need to be taken
             these statistics relate to the companys own employees and do not include losttime accidents
             involving subcontractors employees the level of which remains very low accidents involving
             subcontractors employees numbered 4 in 2009 2 in 2010 1 in 2011 and 4 in 2012

             finally we should note that as in previous years no case of occupational illness was recorded

3 health and safety investments
improvements in working conditions and in the safety of the work environment are achieved by
making the necessary investments in equipment through the upgrading of existing or the introduction
of new procedures and by means of health and safety inspections

the refinery design construction and operation is in accordance with greek and international
regulations and standards nevertheless a comprehensive investment programme in the proper
maintenance of electrical mechanical and electronic equipment and in technical upgrading and
renewal of that equipment is continually implemented taking account of developing technology
so as to maintain the highest possible standards of safety and accident prevention

in 2012 the total cost of the investment programme of all group companies on projects to improve
health and safety and to procure safety and medical equipment amounted to 63 million euros while
the cost of operating expenditure of all kinds in this area was 46 million euros

the greatest part of the abovementioned investments are associated with projects whose aim
is to reduce the risk of accidents and to improve working conditions as well as projects aimed at
upgrading fire safety measures at our facilities

it should be noted that the abovementioned figures do not include costs of routine maintenance
which have direct implications for safety nor safety related components of investments related to
work on major extensions and upgrades to the refinery

          the state of art power management system
          p ms of the refinery

   in 2011 the refinerys power management system was upgraded the original system had
   been introduced in 2005 at a total cost of 31 million euros and the upgrading represented
   a further investment of 08 million euros compelling reasons for this upgrading were the
   need to improve reliability and ensure effective response to operating problems arising
   from the very large number of parameters more than 100000 the pms is called on to
   handle with their values changing twice each second

                the upgraded pms can be operated much more easily by the user from three of the
                refinery control centres which means that any electrical incident can be diagnosed
                immediately and promptly corrected moreover the new powermax system can process
                and react in just 28 milliseconds to any critical electrical fault on the network ensuring  in
                combination with the increased generating capacity of the refinery power plant  smooth and
                uninterrupted operation of all its power generating facilities

                the stability of the electrical network  based on timely and accurate diagnosis of and
                response to any faults that may occur in the internal network or the external grid  is of vital
                importance in the smooth and uninterrupted operation of the refinery facilities

                 a sudden shutdown of refinery operations owing to an electrical problem leads to
                  increased gas emissions from the flares with deleterious effects for local people and the
                  environment
                 in the event of an emergency incident involving a total or partial shutdown of the refinery
                  fires might be caused by leaks in the product piping or by expansion and contraction due
                  to temperature differences the pms allows selective power loadshedding in the event
                  of such an occurrence
                 the pms will also issue warnings of impending problems in the operation of critical
                  equipment or faults in electrical equipment so that a sudden shutdown of refinery
                  facilities can be avoided

                since it came on line in 2005 the pms has helped ensure that the frequent electrical
                irregularities in the network whether due to internal or external causes which often led
                to unit shutdowns are no longer a threat to the smooth running of the refinery with the
                consequent shutdowns now being practically eliminated




             4 inspections
             our company takes extremely seriously the continuous supervision of production and distribution
             equipment work places and fire safety systems as well as the identification of risks through
             scheduled health and safety inspections

             at the refinery planned health and safety inspections are carried out by both internal inspection
             teams and external safety auditors including greek and foreign consultants

             hotworks and work in confined spaces are subject to a programme of intensive auditing
             and inspection the health safety and environment department carries out an average of 7
             inspections a day the annual total for 2012 was close to 1800

             projects under construction are subject to daily inspections while planned horizontal inspections
             carried out by teams of different composition and mandate comprising refinery executives and other
             competent personnel are performed according to an annual schedule as follows
              safety and environment inspections carried out by fourmember teams headed by a section head
               and including engineers and supervisors as members there are 24 such teams each responsible
               for inspecting once a year six of the 24 sections into which the refinery is divided for this purpose

the findings and recommendations arising from the abovementioned horizontal inspection
procedures and recommendations arising from meetings of the two committees after evaluation
lead to appropriate technical or organizational measures being taken in 2012 in total 680 new
recommendations were put forward while 645 were implemented including some pending from the
previous year with another 253 recommendations pending at the end of the year

vertical inspections were introduced four years ago in 2009 these are performed on a threemonthly
basis by section heads engineers and supervisors from the various refinery sections each section
of the refinery will undergo four such inspections each year one for every shift in 2012 205 new
recommendations were put forward following vertical inspections covering all refinery sections 315
recommendations were implemented including some from the previous year and 243 remained
pending

in addition to the above technical inspections and monitoring of equipment carried out by the
technical department also have a safety dimension in that they lead to measures which reduce
hazard and risk and contribute to the improvement of occupational health and safety conditions the
scheduling and management of such inspectionmonitoring and maintenance activity is based on the
use of sophisticated computer systems such as the plant condition management system pcms
that help to determine the most effective and safe technical operating conditions of equipment
combined with the most efficient use of resources

finally the company takes special care to ensure the operational readiness of the fire prevention
system and the installed firefighting equipment the routine and periodically scheduled checking
of these facilities is carried out according to a very carefully planned annual programme under the
supervision of the fire safety service



5 procedures
technical integrity of equipment compliance with international standards and safe working conditions
are amongst the primary factors ensuring safety in the workplace even more important is how
individuals behave the human factor refinery employees are able to perform their work safely
not only as a result of the strict work procedures they are required to follow and as a result of having
been provided with appropriate skills and competencies but also because they have been trained in
safety awareness

complying with legislation
the company is fully aware of and strictly complies with all relevant greek and european health
and safety legislation while it also applies any relevant international standards codes of practice
and other operational norms where these are judged likely to help achieve even higher standards of
protection than would be achieved by legal compliance alone

an independent third party certifies full and comprehensive implementation of legislation in our
internal procedures and operations

we have also developed a database containing all health and safety provisions of greek law relevant
to the refinerys operations it is constantly updated and made available to all employees on the

             company intranet this database is exceptionally important not only for the legality of our operations
             but also for the wealth of information it contains on a wide range of issues including hazard
             identification and control the drafting of emergency preparedness plans maximum acceptable levels
             of exposure to hazardous substances the use of chemical substances and the relevant precautions
             etc

             besides official regulatory documentation the database contains other significant resources relating
             to refinery safety including all training material the complete internal safety regulations for the
             refinery hazard and risk assessment reports covering all individuals workplaces specifications for
             all safety equipment eg personal protective equipment ppe and fire fighting equipment and
             material safety data sheets msds

             hazard identification risk assessment and control
             we are continually engaged in establishing best practices for identification of health and safety
             hazards in all areas and in implementing procedures for their elimination the framework for hazard
             identification and control is provided by greek legislation presidential decree 171996 and law
             38502010 and by other european and international codes of practice

             systematic risk assessment studies have been carried out for all sections all workplaces and all
             hazard types within the refinery site and appropriate measures to eliminate hazards or to control
             risks to acceptable levels have been taken
             whenever changes are made to workplaces or to working practices these risk assessments are
             reviewed so as to ensure they are always relevant and up to date monitoring of the procedure
             has become even more intensive and methodical in the context of our compliance with ohsas
             certification requirements within each refinery section occupational hazards and risks identified are
             classified into three categories according to the hazard level low medium or high for each hazard
             category a schedule for the completion of measures to eliminate hazards or to reduce risk to as low
             as practicable is determined and personal responsibility for completion of these actions is allocated
              low risk measures to be put into effect within one year
              medium risk measures to be put into effect within six months
              high risk measures to be put into effect within one week

             compliance with these schedules is monitored by the health safety and environment section while
             senior management is accordingly kept informed

             we provide appropriate and adequate training to all our workers covering information and instruction
             relevant to the hazards arising from their work measures for the elimination of hazards or control of
             risk correct use of personal protective equipment safe working practices appropriate emergency
             response procedures and first aid provision

             we enforce safety rules in all situations so as to ensure full implementation of precautionary
             measures and compliance with safe working procedures in this context the protocol related to the
             issue of permits to work is particularly important in ensuring high levels of worker protection during
             repair and maintenance operations for this reason the issuing of these permits is the subject of
             continuous training activity covering both those who issue them and those who receive them both
             company employees and any subcontractor personnel who may be involved in work activities on the
             refinery site

             in order to properly assess risk associated with particular refinery operations detailed hazard and
             operability hazop studies are carried out likewise the studies required by the regulations on
             fire safety are conducted other safety studies are prepared and communicated for approval and
             registration as appropriate with the competent authorities

                                                                                                                     03

                                                                                                                     61
specifications have been issued for all types of health and safety equipment ie personal protective
equipment firefighting equipment etc in order to facilitate its effective replacement as and when
necessary and to ensure that equipment types are standardised as far as possible a particular effort
has been made to standardise specifications for personal protective equipment at all companies and
facilities within the group in addition safety equipment specifications are monitored continuously so
that they can be updated in line with the new technological developments within this context in 2012
all personal protective equipment for employees at the alkylation unit was upgraded to incorporate
the latest technological advances


           indicative actions in safety procedures during
           2012

     work has been completed on preparing a hazop study for the vacuum distillation unit in
      the catalytic cracking complex and the alkylation unit
     we have continued implementation of the monitoring and evaluation of contractors
      to verify their compliance with health and safety rules while working in the refinery
      facilities this monitoring programme was initiated in 2006 regular breach of the rules is
      sanctioned in the form of graduated disciplinary measures reflecting the severity of the
      infringements the programme generates a reliability table for contractors where they
      are ranked according to evaluation of infringements detected
     we have carried out an internal inspectionevaluation of 6 procedures in the health and
      safety management system three of the existing procedures were revised
     we continued to update the safety data sheets for refinery products as part of our
      implementation of the provisions of the european reach and clp regulations
     participation in international organizations dedicated to exploring and achieving continual
      improvement in rules and practices




reports measurements and indices
we regularly report record investigate and analyze incidents fires accidents nearmisses
using internationally recognized indices in order to take the appropriate corrective and preventive
measures while enhancing our experience by monitoring investigations of serious accidents at
comparable facilities abroad and incorporating their findings in our own practice

we systematically record and file all relevant operational data which create a picture of our health
and safety performance so as to monitor this performance statistically at the same time through
goalsetting and benchmarking on the basis of internationallyestablished performance indicators we
seek to achieve continuous improvements and to highlight potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities

protection security
we take all necessary preventive measures to protect our installations against possible security
threats both deliberate and nondeliberate those of our personnel responsible for this protection
are suitably trained both in security and safety matters so as to be able to effectively and swiftly fulfil
their responsibilities being fully aware of the duties assigned to them while at the same time fully
respecting individual freedoms and fundamental human rights

                    and the corinth fire brigade

             on 23 february 2012 motor oil and the corinth fire brigade conducted an impressive
             drill rehearsing their response to a major fire incident at the refinery
             the drill was designed
              to improve the good cooperation and operational action between the two sides
              to check coordination of the firefighting forces under conditions approximating to a real
               incident
              to check the efficacy of the plans for a major fire incident
              to check the adequacy of the staff and equipment available
              to check how effective the personnel rescue plan would be during a major fire incident

             the corinth fire brigade participated in the drill with a team of 15 firemen and 4 officers
             four manned vehicles were used for the drill a foam tender with mounted ladder two
             waterfoam tenders of 10 and 13 tons respectively and a rescue vehicle carrying 5 tons of

       companys medical staff they rescue an injured person who is trapped from the tank
       area where t753 is located

    the drill lasted fifty minutes in all during which the cooperation of the two sides was
    excellent the drill was followed by a thorough discussion of observations made during
    the exercise covering the overall tactics and techniques used to deal with the fire the
    problems encountered and other issues




6 planned shutdowns  new projects
every year planned shutdowns of refinery units take place which are necessary to allow for periodic
maintenance to be carried out and thus ensure their reliable operation both in respect of efficiency
and in respect of safe operation while construction works on new projects are constantly carried out

to avoid accidents during planned and unplanned shutdowns a methodical approach is required
with continuous supervision while work is being carried out

such extended shutdowns of refinery units require vigilance and special precautionary safety
measures because of the greatly increased risk of accidents which include provision of information
to all personnel involved in order to ensure they are aware of the necessary safety measures and
to empower their safety awareness daily cooperation with site managers for identifying hazards
or unsafe conditions and for the concomitant implementation of corrective measures and daily site
safety inspections

inspection teams are established at such times headed by executives from the health safety and
environment section and staffed by engineers from the technical department according to the
specific circumstances and the type of unit being shut down the teams are charged with the duty of
continuous monitoring of the maintenance works with respect to application of safety rules so that
immediate corrective measures can be taken if any irregularities arise

during 2012 a number of construction projects were completed or under way work on which was
carried out without accidents in addition there were two planned shutdowns and thirteen unplanned
shutdowns which were handled successfully without accidents

             7 reach and clp regulations
             the european union reach regulation registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals came
             into force on 1 june 2007 the regulation is intended to rationalize european legislation on human
             health safety and environmental protection from the potential effects of various chemical substances
             at the same time the regulation has shifted responsibility for investigating the impacts of production
             distribution and use of these substances to the industry itself

             the legal framework introduced by the regulation directly affects producers importers and final users
             of chemical substances and preparations in the european union the objective is to prohibit the import
             into or the production within the eu of any substance at any quantity above one ton a year unless the
             substance has been entered on the european register of chemical products

             after successful completion of the first phase of substance registration in 2010 motor oil through
             its participation in various recognized organizations and consortia concawe ferc merc remains
             ready to respond to any requirements that may arise is monitoring developments and preparing for the
             subsequent second phase of substance registration 2013

             the clp classification labelling and packaging regulation of the european union came into effect
             in january 2009 ensuring that risks associated with chemical products are clearly communicated
             to employees and consumers in the european union through proper classification and labelling of
             chemical products

             the risks which may be posed to human health and the environment are labelled using a standard
             system of declarations and pictograms on packaging and on safety data sheets so that workers and
             consumers are aware of the possible consequences of handling these products

             motor oil has completed the above process of labelling its products on all safety data sheets



             8 emergency response plans
             our emergency response arrangements are based on the emergency response plan which is
             regularly reviewed and updated to take account of expansions and other changes to the refinerys
             configuration changing legal requirements and changes to best practices resulting from technical
             developments or experience gained by others in dealing with major or nonmajor accidents

             we have also prepared and submitted studies to the competent authorities in line with the
             requirements of the seveso ii eu directive which describe significant potential accident scenarios
             and related prevention and confrontation measures the emergency response plan describes with
             particular reference to a major accident situation the public health protection measures including
             warnings for neighbouring communities and related advice that would be put into effect in the event
             that the major accidents response plans were activated these plans are drafted by the competent
             authorities and determine how the state might intervene in emergency situations

             the emergency response plan prescribes equipment organization and facilities available both
             internally and from offsite sources to manage an emergency

             features of the plan include
             	the mutual aid agreement whereby all greek refineries cooperate in the event of an emergency
               which dates from 1988 the effectiveness of this collaboration is ensured through joint exercises
               involving motor oil the local fire brigade and the other refineries
             	the safety drills organized weekly and the preparedness exercises on dealing with major

                                                                                                                   03

                                                                                                              and safety


                                                                                                                   65
  accidents that are organized several times a year during these exercises the major incident
  response procedure is activated safety drills and major exercises contribute greatly to the training
  and preparedness of employees and to the evaluation and modification of the plan itself they
  also contribute to the assessment and upgrading of fire prevention equipment since one of the
  outputs from these exercises as far as fire safety is concerned are recommendations for further
  improvements to fire safety facilities
	the fixed and portable equipment for fire detection firefighting and leakage detection and
  containing which are upgraded according to a regular annual investment plan
	the availability on the refinery site of six fire engines and one 12000litre bulk foam tender that are
  available on 24hour standby and are operated by trained firefighter crews
	the existence of alternative locations for the incident control room at four different strategic points
  on the refinery site and the availability of a stateoftheart emergency telephone system that
  provides for refinery staff to be contacted at times of emergency outside of normal working hours



9 safety of port installations
we give the highest priority to security measures relating to our port facilities in order to prevent
any incident whatsoever which apart from any other consequences may also cause accidents or
marine pollution it should be noted that in 2004 motor oil became the first greek company to
be certified by the ministry of mercantile marine for compliance with the international ship and port
facility security isps code which is applied according to the requirements of chapter xi2 of the
international convention for the safety of life at sea solas the accreditation is reviewed each year
in accordance with the existing legislative provisions

as required by the isps code drills are carried out every
sixteen months to practice response to sea pollution with the
cooperation and participation of local port authorities

the revised port information and regulations became applicable
in year 2007 we consider the existence of these regulations
which are specific to our port and codify in a single volume all
the requirements for the safe docking of vessels at our terminal
according to ministry of mercantile marine guidelines and
international codes and conventions to be a prerequisite for the
best possible protection of both our installations and the vessels
themselves the port information and regulations consolidate all
provisions arising from the isps code while describing clearly
and in detail our minimum requirements relating to safety and
security as well as the measures to be taken to avoid pollution



10 safeguarding workforce health
safeguarding the health of our workforce and their workplace safety are key areas of concern for
refinery personnel we have in place a programme of regular medical examinations including blood
tests xrays cardiograms eye tests gynaecological tests etc as well as a programme of vaccinations
and hearing tests

a comprehensive occupational health service is provided at the refinery with the appropriate personnel
and material resources in place to provide medical and first aid services including
 central medical centre staffed by an occupational physician and nurses provided with the necessary
  hospital equipment to deal with emergencies

             the continuous training of our employees their updating with the required information the creation
             of a high level of safety awareness together with the technical and organisational measures form
             the essential pillars for accident prevention and the maintenance of a safe work environment this
             fundamental approach underpins the health and safety management system of motor oil

             the education department has a continuing commitment to training the workforce in aspects of the
             production process and safety in order to increase productivity and reduce risks and the frequency of
             accidents

             considerable emphasis is placed on the systematic supply of health and safety information to
             subcontractors who are materially involved in carrying out various refinery site works in particular
             relating to the general principles of accident prevention and the safe work procedures of the

workforce training
in order to raise safety awareness among refinery personnel safety messages and posters the
results of accident and nearmiss investigations etc are displayed on 13 health and safety notice
boards reserved for this purpose and located throughout the refinery site

fire safety drills continued to take place like in every year and were carried out by the immediate
intervention teams made up of refinery training staff the drills are held once a week at a location
which may or may not be disclosed in advance unscheduled emergency drills are also staged from
time to time during the year

rescue teams received training from the first search and rescue team emak of the elefsina fire
brigade in rescue of persons at risk in inaccessible parts of the refinery at a great height from the
ground

moreover the structured efforts to educate the technical staff of our facilities were continued through
films and presentationsdiscussions on incidents analyzing causes effects and the corrective
measures taken

briefing for contractors employees
briefings for employees of contractors working in our facilities continued in 2012 with a training
programme including provision of information questionandanswer sessions recording results
in a database issuing certificates of attendance on the course for recipients of permits to work
the general component of this training concerns health and safety matters relevant to aspects of
refinery work while a further specialist component addresses 29 different types of jobs this briefing
programme lasts eight hours and in 2012 the sessions were attended by 364 persons

                      fire safety training

                in order to improve the readiness of refinery personnel to respond to emergency situations
                as well as to rehearse the procedures of the emergency response plan and check the
                operability of equipment regular emergency preparedness exercises are carried out the
                2012 programme featured 7 training sessions on the exercise field and 46 drills one a
                week 21 of which evolved into a full major incident response exercise about half of these
                drills were preannounced and prescheduled while the rest were impromptu ie with
                no warning of the date time location or scenario involving the deployment of emergency
                response equipment as well

                the prescheduled drills took place in various areas of the refinery and the fire crew
                training field involving rehearsal of fire crews in the theoretical and practical aspects of
                their duties and their familiarisation with firefighting equipment and related personal
                protective equipment

                desktop exercises were also organized at department control rooms for all shifts in the
                presence of area staff and fire safety crews examining issues of special interest

                the refinerys engineers onduty participated in the fire safety drills
                it should be noted that the fire safety drill programme for 2012 led to 13 observations on
                new projects to improve fire protection for facility equipment 9 of which were implemented
                immediately while the other 4 were entered on the refinery safety project list for
                implementation upon completion of a technical study

                in addition in 2012
                 for the purpose of upgrading the level of training of the fire safety crews a special sixmonth
                  programme of training was introduced involving 120 meetings over the sixmonth period
                  the training sessions were also attended by new operators acting as reserve crews to learn
                  the operation and use of the fire engines and gradually ready themselves to man the crews
                 all shiftworkers passed the annual training in the use of respiratory protective equipment
                 the weekly training of the rescue team continued in operation
                 training sessions were held to maintain training levels for fire engine drivers and reserve
                  drivers familiarizing them with access to various areas and the equipment in new units
                 there were also training sessions for 13 new crew leaders as well as all the new drivers to
                  familiarize them with the fire engines and their movement around the refinery
                 finally the refinery office staff security staff restaurant and storeroom staff were trained in
                  the correct and safe use of fire extinguishers




             collaborations
             in attaining our objectives and ensuring a responsible approach to health and safety issues
             collaboration with other stakeholders is regarded as essential to this end we cooperate closely with
             national organizations and institutions while greek refineries cooperation meetings on health safety
             and environment issues are organized and attended by representatives of the refineries the competent
             ministries local government the fire department academics and other stakeholders
             also in 2012 motor oil and avin oil continued their participation in collaboration with the technical
             university of crete in the european programme proteas under the title reach protocol on
             emissions and accident scenarios in the supply and movement of fuels and petrochemicals

                                                                                                                 03

the proteas programme is funded by the european life programme its main objective
is to support implementation of the new european reach and clp regulations in greece
and cyprus the programme was launched in 2011 and will be completed in december
2014

the programmes objective is
 to use existing industrial standards best practices and legislative requirements in the
  areas of health safety and the environment as well as procedures to prevent emissions
  and accidental leaks of fuels and lubricants into the air water or soil
 use of the provisions on health safety and the environment as well as the guidelines
  incorporated in the msds as required by the reach regulations
 drawing up a protocol of correct practices in the context of a management system for
  health safety and the environment
 to contribute to the implementation of the reach regulations and to reduce the risk of
  emissions or accidental leaks of hazardous substances
in 2012 a review was held at our company  by the eu  on the progress of the
implementation of the programme with very satisfactory results

road safety
road safety is a priority concern for the commercial companies of the group which
move large quantities of fuels by road every day in 2012 more than 300 road tanker
drivers of our own fleet and of subcontracted fleets received training in road safety
in implementation of our road safety education guidelines

fuels are a category of hazardous materials and their safe transport requires
precautionary measures to be taken at three levels ie
 the maintenance of a high technical standard of transport equipment ie road tankers
 the promulgation of strict safety procedures and the monitoring of their implementation
 the continuous updating and training of road tanker drivers

the groups commercial companies avin oil coral and coral gas in running their business
operations in a responsible manner have always strived to ensure that the above precautions are
taken and that the regulations prescribed by the state and by the oil industry itself are maintained in
order to achieve this goal they have established integrated transport safety systems encompassing
the registration and monitoring of all road tankers involved in the transportation of fuels for their own
account which applies to both the company owned vehicles and those owned by subcontracted freight
companies and the training of all drivers that are engaged in the operation of these road tankers

a thorough annual safety check is carried out on all road tankers in accordance with the requirements
of the regulation for the safe road tanker loading at fuel terminals issued by the hellenic
petroleum marketing companies association seepe
this check extends to the full compliance with the terms included in the european agreement
concerning the carriage of dangerous goods by road adr

there is also an ongoing training programme focusing on safe and defensive driving loadingunloading
and fuelmanagement procedures antiskid and antirollover manoeuvres fuel chemistry handling of
customer complaints vehicle safety equipment steam recovery etc

in recent years the programme has also incorporated a detailed analysis of the routes taken by our
tanker drivers so that the safest route is always taken for each journey gps tracking devices have also
been fitted to tankers to allow closer monitoring of driver behaviour speed route taken stops etc

every years training sessions cover part of this programme so that over a 23 year cycle all new
drivers receive their training and existing drivers receive topup training

responsibility
for the
environment
protection of the environment and energysaving are among our primary concerns
respect and care for the environment is a common denominator in all activities of the motor oil group we operate
competitively but at the same time as a responsible corporate organisation we espouse the principles of sustainable
development that is development which is based on environmental protection mutual respect and responsibility towards
future generations for these reasons we continue with investments aimed at the steady improvement of our environmental
performance

in 2012 we spent 197 million euros in our investment programme featuring both large and smaller scale projects making
a direct or indirect contribution to environmental protection our environmental footprint as measured by declining specific
energy consumption and specific carbon dioxide emissions continued to decline specific values of sulphur dioxide and
water consumption remained at last years levels with only the value for water showing a slight increase

in addition we revised a number of the environmental management system procedures and published our annual
voluntary environmental statement 2011 in accordance with the emas iii er 12212009 regulation

in 2011 work was completed on ensuring complete energy autonomy for the refinery with the addition to the power
cogeneration complex of a fifth combinedcycle high energy efficiency gas turbine raising the installed power to 85mw

moreover in 2010 the new crude distillation unit came into operation as well as the new sulphur recovery units
which incorporate best available techniques and stateoftheart antipollution technology 2011 was the first year of full
12month operation for these investments improving the overall environmental performance of the refinery

                      1 environmental management
                      our principal aim is to ensure that our facilities operate in the most energy efficient manner possible
                      to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants to function within the framework of
                      approved environmental terms to rigorously adhere to the relevant greek and european legislation and
                      to implement projects and actions that go beyond basic legal compliance

                      selection of the most efficient means and measures to reduce environmental impact covers the entire
                      spectrum of our activities from the selection of technologies when building new process units to the
                      practices applied during the refinerys daily operation and from the use of advanced process control
                      systems to the training provided to employees working at the refinery


                      environmental management system
                      the focal commitment of the company to the minimization of the environmental impact resulting
                      from its operation is expressed through our health safety and environmental protection policy our
                      commitment could not be realised without the application of an effective environmental management
                      system that has been certified compliant with international standards this system ensures that
                      environmental performance is measured systematically and that activities requiring intervention
                      and improvement are identified thus the principle of prevention is successfully implemented and
                      resources are allocated so as to achieve the maximum possible environmental benefit

      who work on our premises on the implementation of our environmental protection policy
     evaluating our environmental performance and continuously improving our environmental
      management system
     developing communication and dialogue with all stakeholders especially with local
      communities in areas around the companys facilities


the companys environmental management system was first isocertified in 2000 according to iso
140001996 in 2004 it was certified compliant with the updated version iso 140002004 in 2007 it was
recertified compliant with the new version iso 140012004 while in 2008 the certification expanded
to include the production trade and delivery of fuels biofuels lubricants waxes asphalt and special
petroleum products in 2010 the system was recertified by bureau veritas confirming compliance
with iso 140012004

the environmental management system is part of the integrated management system which is
iso 90012008 certified for quality therefore the various internal operations and procedures of the
environmental management system are themselves subject to the strict documentation imposed by
the iso 90012008 standard

our commitment to making public any data relating to our environmental performance and the effects
arising from the operation of our facilities as expressly mentioned in our environmental policy has
led to the voluntary adoption and application of the european ecomanagement and audit scheme
emas as provided for in european union regulation 12212009 this system requires that we
implement appropriate procedures for the identification of the material environmental impacts arising
from our activities and define strategies and implement programmes to mitigate them insofar as is
reasonably possible

additionally within the framework of emas the company is committed to publishing on an annual
basis information about its environmental performance in the form of an environmental statement
as required by its membership to the ecomanagement and audit scheme system an arrangement
that has to be endorsed annually by decision of the ministry of the environment energy and climate
change in 2012 motor oil issued its bvcertified environmental statement 2011 its sixth such
annual report

it should be noted that in the oil refining sector the triple combination of certified compliance with
iso 140012004 and emas in respect of environmental performance and iso 90012008 in respect of
quality management is particularly significant and provides advantages at many levels such multiple
certification is unusual among european refineries with high complexity as motor oils
the new environmental terms on which the refinery must operate approved and put into effect
in 2009 and amended in 2011 place all the refinery facilities including ancillary facilities like the
truck loading station and the port installations under the requirements of directives 9661εc

                      at the prevention and avoidance of air and water pollution or the contamination of soil and ensuring
                      the most effective means are adopted to deal with all environmental protection aspects of the
                      refinerys operations

                      in 2012 as part of efforts to secure the ongoing evolution and improvement of the environmental
                      management system five processes and procedures were reviewed


                      2 environmental impact management
                      motor oil in striving to continuously improve its environmental performance over and above
                      consistent legal compliance implements a programme of measures for the prevention and
                      management of the environmental
                      impacts that are unavoidably
                      associated with its operations

                      an important tool in this endeavour
                      is the measurement regular
                      evaluation of results and the
                      systematic assessment of the
                      environmental impacts at all stages
                      of the production process this
                      assessment is based on a set
                      of criteria including legislative
                      requirements and stakeholder
                      views which lead to the
                      classification of impacts according
                      to their significance and their
                      characterisation as significant or
                      nonsignificant this classification
                      procedure is also carried out
                      whenever there are any changes
                      to the refinerys configuration
                      reevaluating the classification and
                      characterisation of the impacts

                      this procedure for classifying the
                      environmental impacts associated
                      with the refinerys operation
                      and their significance classification has led to the following impacts being classified as significant
                      therefore constituting the challenges we are called upon to manage
                       gas emissions from fixed combustion sources and from the refinerys production processes
                       energy and water consumption

                       liquid industrial effluents and urban liquid waste
                       noise

                      the above environmental impacts are recorded on a regular basis and suitable environmental
                      indices are used for their monitoring on the basis of which the appropriate actions are planned
                      and implemented so as to ensure that proper measures are taken and that there is effective

                      improving the performance of the sulphur recovery circuit

                      2010 saw the commissioning of the new crude distillation unit the design of which satisfies the latest
                      european specifications for environmental protection and safety while incorporating best available
                      techniques and making particular provisions for enhanced energy efficiency furthermore in 2010
                      the construction of the new sulphur recovery units and of the new reverse osmosis desalination
                      plant were completed which further improve the refinerys environmental performance while
                      the completion of the upgrading of the lubricants production complex involved the replacement of
                      compressors and heat exchangers with new more energyefficient units


                      4 best available techniques
                      the integrated pollution prevention and control ippc directive 9661ec prescribes an integrated
                      system for prevention and control of pollution that may be caused by industrial activities the
                      integrated approach is based on the overall environmental performance of a facility and covers
                      emissions into the atmosphere water and subsoil contamination generation of solid wastes use of
                      raw materials and energy noise accident prevention and the rehabilitation of worksites

                      this directive introduced the concept of best available techniques bats into legal requirements
                      bats are techniques that can prevent primary prevention measures that are intrinsic to the
                      production process itself or control secondary measures or endofpipe techniques in a most
                      efficient manner the pollution caused by an industrial activity while being economically feasible and
                      technically practicable best available techniques for various sectors are prescribed in the relevant
                      best available techniques reference documents brefs

                      motor oil incorporates the abovementioned techniques both during the design of new refinery
                      units and when existing facilities are upgraded in order to minimize the impacts arising from their
                      operation in cases of modernization expansion improvement or modification of existing units and
                      procedures at the same time the company incorporates automations and control systems into
                      the operation of the refinery that contribute to efficient management of raw materials and energy
                      while ensuring high levels of reliability and safety in the units finally best available techniques that
                      reinforce pollution prevention capacity have been adopted and are applied in the refinerys daily
                      operations

                      some typical examples of bat applications are shown in the following table

                      climate change is one of the most important global challenges  for human health for social
                      cohesion for economic development and for the security of food supplies

                      according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc changes to the climate itself
                      increased average temperature changes to atmospheric conditions etc and the effects of such
                      changes altered ecosystem composition reduced polar ice caps observed variations in the duration
                      of each season etc are already clearly detectable

                      it has been widely accepted that the principal cause of climate change is the increased concentration
                      of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere most importantly carbon dioxide co2 but also methane
                      ch4 chlorofluorocarbons cfcs sulphur hexafluoride sf6 and nitrous oxide ν2ο

use of natural gas
introducing the use of natural gas to the refinery in 2008 was an important step towards reducing
its carbon footprint while also improving financial and environmental results given that the use of
natural gas reduces co2 emissions and is the economically most efficient way of generating electricity
and producing hydrogen its use as a fuel also has positive consequences in cutting pollutant levels in
flue gases
natural gas is used
	as an alternative raw material for the hydrogen production unit instead of naphtha or lpg
   which allows the quantities of carbon dioxide emitted to be reduced by approximately 8 and 19
   respectively
	as an alternative fuel for the power cogeneration plant gas turbines instead of either fuel gas or
   propane achieving a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 16
	as an alternative or supplementary fuel for preheat furnaces and steam boilers in the place of
   heavy fuel oil fractions thus both increasing energy efficiency and significantly reducing emissions
   of air pollutants


power and steam cogeneration plant
at the end of 2011 with a total investment of 28 million euros the fifth gas turbine and the third
heat recovery steam generator hrsg installation was completed in the power cogeneration plant
the hrsg installation purpose was to exploit the gas turbine exhaust gases temperature for steam
generation the new gas turbine was constructed by siemens and it incorporates stateoftheart
technologies for emission reduction in order to protect the environment efficiency optimization and
maintenance cost minimization

the cogeneration plant now includes five gas turbines with a total active power of 85 mw and three
boilers recovering heat from the exhaust fumes generated these boilers generate about 140 tons
of high and low pressure steam per hour making the refinery selfsufficient in electricity  as it
eliminates the need to draw power from the public power corporation grid  and meeting most of
its need for steam the operation of the plant also contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions at a national level by drastically reducing electricity consumption from the public power
corporation ppc the production of which would require a different fuel mix the resulting benefit for
the environment in terms of lower co2 emissions due to own generation of electricity  is indicated in

                      the significant differentiations between the years 2011 and 2012 are mainly due to the operation of
                      the fifth gas turbine

                      in addition
                       in 2012 the coproduction of around 140 tons of steam per hour by the plant is translated into a benefit
                         for the environment amounting to around 298000 tons of co2 which would have otherwise been
                         released from the burning of additional fuel in the refinerys steam generators
                       the environmental benefit is enhanced by the plants use of natural gas which leads to corresponding
                         reductions in the burning of refinery gas and lpg

                      the power management system best available technique which was upgraded in 2011 protects
                      the refinery from full or partial shutdown owing to a breakdown in the internal or external grid
                      significantly increasing the level of safety and reliability and thereby improving environmental
                      efficiency


                      upgrading of burners and preheat furnaces
                      the upgrading or replacement of furnaces provides for the more efficient exploitation of the heat
                      content of flue gases thus achieving reductions in both fuel consumption and in the emissions of co2
                      and other air pollutants a programme of gradual upgrades to the refinerys furnaces involving the
                      adoption of the forceddraft technology which increases the efficiency by more than 6 is in place
                      while a similar programme applies to the replacement of existing burners with more energyefficient
                      units which emit lower levels of nitrogen oxides lownox burners for example the upgrading of
                      the crude oil preheat furnace of the crude distillation unit in 2007 the largest furnace at the refinery
                      raised thermal efficiency from 80 to 87

                      in 2012 work continued on replacement of the furnace in the thermal pyrolysis unit the new furnace
                      has been designed in accordance with best practice and is expected to achieve a level of thermal
                      efficiency 20 greater than that of the existing furnace


                      gas and condensates recovery
                      levels of recovery of condensates which are fed into steam generators for steam production
                      remained high in 2012
                      the exploitation of the energy content of condensates contributes towards the reduction of fuel gas
                      and liquid fuel volumes that would otherwise be used for steam generation by the steam boilers

                      in addition there is an ongoing programme for maximising the recovery of gases to be used as fuel
                      and thus minimize flaring


                      desalination
                      reverse osmosis is the most energyefficient type of desalination technology and is being extensively
                      exploited extensive use is made of this technique with two units in operation while work began in
                      2012 on installation of a third unit

                                                                                                                       04

monitoring and daily practice
the energy performance of production units is constantly monitored so as to correct any
malfunctions that come to light the advanced process control system through continuous
monitoring achieves the optimisation of energy use in the units where it has been installed

with the same aim the refinerys preventive maintenance programme provides for
	the systematic retubing repair and cleaning of heat exchangers and air coolers in order to
  increase the percentage of heat recovery
 replacing through annual programmes of pipeline and equipment insulation thus minimizing
  losses to the environment
	the maintenance andor replacement of rotating equipment whose energy performance has fallen
  below specified levels as a result of length of use
 repairing andor replacing of the refractory material burners and tubes of preheat furnaces

emissions monitoring
to protect and improve air quality air pollutant emissions are monitored using a wide range of
techniques stateoftheart measurement equipment continuously renewed and upgraded is
employed the measurement programme including continuous as well as intermittent readings
covers both point and diffuse emission sources

in the peripheral zone of the refinery air quality is monitored by four appropriately equipped stations
 three fixed monitoring stations are capable of continuously measuring the concentration of
  hydrogen sulphide h2s and sulphur dioxide so2
 a mobile station equipped with automated stateoftheart measuring and recording devices which
  can perform a wide range of measurements including meteorological parameters wind speed and
  direction air temperature and relative humidity and the concentrations of nitrogen oxides νο νο2
  and nox sulphur dioxide so2 hydrogen sulphide h2s carbon monoxide co methane total
  hydrocarbons hydrocarbons excluding methane ch4 nmhc thc benzene and particulate matter
  pm10 and pm25

within the refinery flue gases from the stacks of the main combustion plants point emissions of the
fuels hydrocracking and lubricants complexes are continuously monitored by online analysers the
parameters monitored are concentrations of oxygen nitrogen oxides sulphur dioxide and suspended
particles in flue gases as well as temperature flow and pressure of flue gases

as in the case of the main refinery stacks the main pipelines channelling gases to the flares of the
combustion lubricants and hydrocracking units are subject to continuous flow measurement
moreover there is continuous measurement of concentration of overall suphur in flue gases in the
flares of the combustion and hydrocracking units
at the catalytic cracking unit there is continuous monitoring of the flow and temperature of the flue
gases the concentration of oxygen and carbon monoxide of sulphur dioxide of nitrogen oxides and
of suspended particles
it should be noted that all analysers are connected to the refinerys distributed control system dcs
a configuration that allows for the complete control of the combustion taking place in the furnaces

emissions from the refinerys other stacks are monitored every three months by a suitably accredited
external organisation

an automated performance control system operates at the sulphur recovery units which
continuously monitors and records h2s concentrations at the entry points and h2s and sο2
concentrations at the exit points of these units also the h2ssο2 ratio is continuously measured
recorded and adjusted so as to ensure maximization of recovery performance which is of the
order of 995 in the case of the new scottype units the smooth operation of the afterburners

                      incinerators associated with these units is achieved through continuous monitoring of sο2 and ο2
                      at the exit points and of the temperature at the radiant section of the furnaces operation of both the
                      sulphur recovery units and the afterburners is automatically controlled via the refinerys distributed

                      clean fuels  integrated sulphur management system
                      refineries are faced with the following paradox the amount of sulphur in the available crude oil types
                      is increasing in the course of time while the specifications for allowable sulphur content in clean
                      fuels produced have reached extremely low levels eg for petrol and automotive diesel the 2009
                      specification for sulphur content is a maximum of 10 ppm or the equivalent of 0001 moreover the
                      maximum acceptable level of sulphur emissions is also low since the content of sulphur dioxide in
                      the atmosphere around a refinery on an hourly basis should not exceed 350 mgm³ in this context
                      the removal of sulphur coming into the refinery with crude oil at a concentration varying between 05
                      and 20 is a significant challenge

                      motor oil as a responsible corporate citizen with respect for the environment has in place a
                      particularly effective system which incorporates best available techniques in order to achieve the
                      best results both in terms of maximising the degree of sulphur removal and minimising the amount
                      of energy consumed

                      in this way the company is able to produce and market petrol and automotive diesel with a sulphur
                      content of less than 10 ppm having brought on line in 2005 its hydrocracker plant an investment
                      worth more than 350 million euros

                      this results in reduced sulphur emissions within the refinery while the overall rate of hydrogen
                      sulphide conversion into elemental sulphur in the new scottype sulphur recovery units
                      commissioned in 2010 reaches 999

                      elemental sulphur is initially produced in liquid form which by relevant cooling and appropriate
                      processing is converted to a solid granular form stored in silos for sale as a raw material for the
                      production of sulphuric acid and fertilisers the whole process is carried out in a completely closed
                      circuit thus avoiding the dispersing of sulphur particles in the air and minimising entirely any
                      environmental impacts

                      controlling emissions
                      besides the measures for monitoring concentrations of air pollutants a number of other measures to
                      reduce air pollution are in operation within the refinery complex and elsewhere including
                       reduction of emissions of suspended catalyst particles in flue gases from the catalytic cracking
                        unit is achieved by means of an electrostatic precipitator which treats the flue gases stream
                        this preventive measure achieves far greater reduction in suspended particulate matter than the
                        acceptable limits
                      	fuel gases used as fuel in the refinery are desulphurised as a result of which sulphur dioxide
                        emissions are minimised before entering the refinery fuel gas system
                      	upgrading of the four steam boilers at the refinerys steam production plant included the installation
                        of lownox burners significantly reducing the level of nitrogen oxides emissions
                       reduction of fugitive hydrocarbon emissions by means of various measures including the
                        installation of closed circuits in gas processes the routing of gases released from safety valves to
                        the flares the installation of secondary seals in floating roof tanks the installation of floating covers
                        on oil separators and the installation of a vapour recovery unit at the truck loading terminal at the
                        same time as bottomloading of road tankers was introduced
                       vapour recovery units as anticipated by legislation are also installed at all avin oil and coral
                        terminals and bottomloading of road tankers is in use at all terminals except for that at kavala

         leak detectιon and repaιr ldar


   a modern refinery comprises lots of different types of installed equipment through which
   large quantities of crude oil and feedstock circulate as well as intermediates and final
   products in such a system it is to be expected that there will be particular points with
   a higher risk of hydrocarbons being accidentally released into the atmosphere in order
   to contain such fugitive emissions from equipment a programme of periodic checks of
   selected equipment points is implemented for detecting fugitive emissions and immediately
   repairing the leaks causing these emissions in the industry this is known as leak detection
   and repair ldar programme and is based on the epa 21 method of the united states
   environmental protection agency

   fugitive emissions may arise from valves pumps flanges safety valves and other related
   equipment installed on pipelines pressure vessels reactors or storage tanks on the site

   in 2012 the ldar programme at motor oils refinery included 6171 predetermined control
   points covering all production units the truck loading terminals port facilities storage
   tanks and oil separators these points are regularly checked by refinery personnel at least
   once a year the frequency depending on the process being controlled using portable volatile
   hydrocarbon concentration measurement equipment in the event that concentrations are
   found to exceed 5000 ppm a repair request for the equipment checked is issued

   in 2012 15651 checks were carried out as a result of which 59 points were detected
   requiring some sort of intervention

                      7 liquid waste management
                      liquid waste produced by the refinerys various processes fall into two categories industrial waste
                      and urban waste
                      the management and processing of liquid waste incorporates best available techniques while due
                      to their different pollutant load the industrial and urban waste streams undergo different types of
                      processing prior to their final disposal industrial liquid waste is preprocessed in specific refinery
                      units and then transferred to the industrial waste water treatment plant while urban waste is
                      transferred directly to the urban liquid waste treatment plant the residual sludge left after the
                      waste is processed is dehydrated and compressed prior to final disposal according to the approved
                      refinery environmental terms
                      the effectiveness of operation of the industrial waste water treatment plant is evidenced by the
                      fact that concentrations of various pollutant substances at the plant outlet are clearly below relevant
                      limits in the case of some substances including benzene toluene ethyl benzene xylene and a
                      number of heavy metals their concentrations are very much below corresponding limit values
                      approaching the limits of detection in some cases

 monitoring and control of subsoil and aquifer quality based on a hydrogeological study submitted
  to the ministry of the environment energy and climate change takes place at 8 boreholes during
  2012 in accordance with the refinerys environmental operating conditions two sets of samples
  were taken at these boreholes  one every six months in order to determine the value of a number
  of parameters such as concentrations of heavy metals and hydrocarbons the results of which were
  found to meet legislative requirements
 sampling and measurements continued in 2012 to monitor conditions in the seawater of the
  coastal area near the refinery the study was conducted by the applied geochemistry laboratory
  of the geology department university of patras according to the project director professor s
  varnavaswe have established from evaluation and interpretation of the research findings that in
  all respects the qualitative characteristics of the waters and the environmental conditions prevailing
  in the coastal zone of the motor oil facilities are the normal characteristics of a coastal marine
  environment the refinery facilities are having no impact on the environment



8 solid waste management  recycling
the management of solid waste produced during the operation of the refinery is founded on an
integrated procedure that covers all stages of the life cycle of refinery solid waste from its collection
packaging labelling processing where necessary temporary storage and final exploitation or
disposal via one of the following alternative means recycling outside the refinery recovery outside
the refinery final disposal outside the refinery or processing within the refinery and reuse
the main aims of the solid waste management programme are
 reduction of quantities produced at source
 separation into hazardous and nonhazardous waste at source wherever possible
 maximum exploitation prior to final disposal through recycling or reuse or recovery of useful
  components or regeneration and finally
 safe transportation and final disposal without putting at risk human health or the environment

only licensed companies specializing in the handling of solid waste are being contacted for carrying
out disposal of such waste
spent catalysts which depending on the particular case may be classified as hazardous solid waste
are disposed of in a number of ways either exported or regenerated for reuse by specialised firms
abroad or used in cement manufacture empty hazardous substance containers are also disposed of
by licensed companies

                      recovery of raw materials
                      a special form of recycling is the recovery of raw materials from various waste streams in order to
                      minimise the loss of raw materials reprocessing major efforts are made to maximise reprocessing
                      due to its environmental and economic significance the aim is firstly to minimise the presence of
                      raw materials in the waste streams and secondly to maximise the amount recovered

                      9 water management
                      the sustainable management of water resources is now a necessity since water is one of the natural
                      resources at risk motor oil recognises this reality and we take steps to reduce water consumption
                      and ensure its rational management at the refinery

                      the water used in the various parts of the refinery is sea water processed at desalination units
                      the desalination is effected using both multistage flashing and reverse osmosis techniques the

                                                                                                                                                              04

                                                                                                                                                              89
latter being the preferred method from an environmental and economic perspectivethe refinerys
desalination system has three multistage flashing units and two reverse osmosis plants while work
is under way on construction of a third reverse osmosis plant planned to come on line in 2013 the
above measures will mean the refinerys needs for water will be fully met and the need to purchase
additional fresh water will be reduced to a minimum

thus while in 2007 incoming water amounted to 125000 m3 over the next two years the figure fell
to below 10000 m3 but in 2010 an additional 82000 m3 were required because of the expansion of
the refinery in 2011 the amount of incoming water fell to zero and in 2012 only 4000 m3 had to be
purchased

it should be noted that following the incorporation into the plant of the new hydrocracking unit in
november 2005 an increase to 0402 m3 was seen in 2006 in the quantity of water consumed per
ton of raw material since then this percentage has declined  except in the year 2008 when it rose
to 0391 owing to extensive preparation of equipment as part of the major preventive maintenance
programme at the refinery  falling by 2011 to 0317 in 2012 the rate remained at the same low
levels with just a slight increase to 0321 cubic metres of water per ton of raw material

reuse and recycling of water
one of the important processes at the refinery is the processing of the acid water flows generated
in different phases of the production process in order to remove hydrogen sulphate and ammonia
about 50 of this water flow is recycled to feed the crude oil desalinators while the rest is channelled
to the industrial waste water treatment plant allowing a proportional reduction in consumption of
fresh water and in the volume of wastes needing treatment


10 noise management
noise caused by industrial facilities such as the refinery is an inevitable and unavoidable consequence
of the activities taking place motor oil makes every effort possible to reduce noise levels and thereby
limit the nuisance caused to those living around the refinery carrying out measurements at regular
intervals at set points around the facility and taking a number of measures

results of measurements for 2012 are set out in the table below and show that noise levels are lower
than the legal limits laid down in the environmental operating conditions of the refinery

                      particular care is also taken with the new projects being carried out at the refinery for example special
                      measures were taken at the new power generation unit 5th gas turbine including the installation of
                      silencers the placing of noise screens and the procurement of equipment with low noise emissions
                      with the result that the new unit adds very little to the overall noise level of the refinery


                      11 protection of the marine environment
                      due to its location the operation of motor oils refinery is completely linked with the marine
                      environment owing to the extensive impacts of a potential pollution incident both for the marine
                      ecosystem and the economic and social life of adjacent areas as well as the tremendous expense that
                      rehabilitation would involve extensive prior planning and preparation for successfully responding to
                      such incidents is imperative

                      within this context we have secured iso140012004 certification for the companys environmental
                      management system and have voluntarily adopted and implemented the emas community system for
                      ecomanagement and audit
                      in addition the company
                      	implements all necessary active and passive protection measures to minimize the risk of oil spills
                        during the operation of its refinery
                      	implements all necessary measures and provides all equipment for the safe sail in and sail out of
                        tankers at its port facilities as well as for the safe loadingunloading thereof
                       maintains all necessary equipment for responding to local small and medium scale water pollution
                        incidents tiers 1 and 2 such as absorbents booms skimmers coastline cleaning equipment and
                        vessels boats tugboats and a special vessel equipped with tanks for storing the collected oilthere
                        are also appropriate stocks of oil dispersants used at the final stage of cleanup operations when
                        authorised by the port authorities
                      	audits its preparedness to implement the existing antipollution plans and maintains at a high level
                        the personnels ability to make use of the relevant equipment with an annual schedule of drills
                        including both tier 1 small scale and tier 2 medium scale pollution incident drills in july 2012 a
                        largescale tier 3 drill was carried out in association with the isthmia port authority the coast guard
                        and other local agencies it should be noted that the scenario in the above drills involves more general
                        refinery safety issues as well as security issues for the port and vessels
                      	is a member of international and regional organizations whose aim is the prevention and timely
                        response to oil spill incidents see participations  collaborations section in chapter 1


                      12 refinery communication with local
                      stakeholders
                      motor oil uses various means of keeping local authorities and other stakeholders informed of its
                      activities either by involving its own staff in conferences and meetings or keeping local organisations
                      informed about its investment plans and its programmes relating to environmental protection

                      besides briefing local authorities the company also maintains open communication lines with refinery
                      neighbours listening and responding to any complaints they may have there is a specific procedure

                                                                                                                          04

at the refinery on the basis of which complaints lodged by local people are recorded investigated and
evaluated and depending on the cause of the nuisance the suitable corrective measures are taken
either immediately or in the long term typical examples of actions to reduce disturbance are the
selection of low noiseemitting equipment wherever possible the installation of sound curtains on the
compressors at the waste water treatment plant installation of a foam breakdown system at the same
facility and the installation of a silencer on a steam exhaust line at the hydrocracker complex

in 2010 the number of complaints was relatively large because of the procedures involved in preparing
for opening of the new crude distillation unit but as soon as that work was completed the number of
complaints fell to the levels of previous years in 2012 only 26 complaints were received  the lowest
figure for the last five years

social
responsibility
we stand side by side with the community offering consistent
and longlasting support
our responsible relationship with society is expressed first and foremost through our
contribution to the general economic growth and the recovery of the greek economy 
currently in the middle of the worst crisis in our modern history it is of vital importance to
us that our activities should benefit the local communities where our facilities are located by
way of job creation fostering local entrepreneurial activity and purchasing goods and services
from local suppliers
moreover we believe that our business activities should be based on positive and productive interaction with the social
environment in which we operate our responsibility towards society is to participate actively in enhancing social values and
helping to improve social cohesion and optimism for a humane future for these reasons we implement a comprehensive
programme of donations and sponsorships that benefit local communities improve quality of life help in protecting the
environment and promote social and cultural activities in these areas as well as enriching the social and cultural life of society
as a whole

through our social responsibility projects we seek to demonstrate a steady consistent support for the community in line
with our corporate objectives and values we seek to support values which will improve the life of the community  in culture
education health care sports and entrepreneurship in 2012 our companys social action focused on the financing and
promotion of social solidarity programmes across the country though our primary focus was placed on organizations and
agencies based mainly in municipalities in the vicinity of our facilities our primary objective in the difficult period our country
is going through has been to provide relief for more vulnerable social groups and to help them meet their basic needs
to this end we have promoted actions designed to bring relief to our fellow men while also supporting cultural agencies
educational institutions organizations engaged in charitable and humanitarian work as well as local government agencies

in 2012 continuing the long tradition established by motor oil as a socially active corporate citizen donations and
sponsorships were made available to support many and varied activities by worthy organisations and institutions the actions
we have supported were chosen by the relevant executives of the company at the local and central levels in accordance with
the procedures set out in the relevant policy and in implementation of our strategy for social responsibility which is structured
along the following key axes



 social solidarity 			                         environment and infrastructures
 culture 				                                  entrepreneurship

                 in 2012 the motor oil group spent 23 million euros on social
                 responsibility projects raising the total spent over the last decade to
                 33 million euros
                 in the local communities ie those areas bordering on or in the general area of our refinery
                 our strategic aspiration is to be a vehicle of prosperity creating jobs and supporting the local
                 market while also showing more general concern in developing constructive relations and open
                 communication with local communities in a spirit of reciprocal trust and respect

                 more than 600 of our employees live in the municipalities bordering on our refinery while in 2012 we
                 paid 11 million euros on municipal taxes and spent around 77 million euros on purchasing products
                 and services from businesses in the region

                 the social responsibility programmes we support in our local communities are selected through a
                 process of dialogue communication and cooperation with the various authorities and agencies of
                 the municipalities of corinth and loutraki and the communities of agioi theodoroi isthmia sofiko
                 and athikia the main criteria used in selecting programmes for support is their contribution to
                 development and progress for local communities their strengthening of the social fabric and their
                 use of synergies leading to more tangible products than a simple meeting of social needs

 7 gri compliance level
 the motor oil sustainability report which has been published every year since 2002 is the main tool available for
 communicating with our stakeholders about the groups efforts and performance in achieving sustainable development through
 the application of the principles and objectives of corporate social responsibility it contains the most important facts and data
 relating to the previous years financial social and environmental performance

 the sustainability report 2012 has a similar structure to previous editions so as to facilitate comparisons of performance over
 time the information and data presented in the report concern the parent company motor oil the group subsidiaries avin
 oil coral coral gas and ofc which are controlled by motor oil and whose activities have a significant impact on issues
 considered as material for sustainable development

 the compilation of sustainability report 2012 takes full consideration of the ten principles of the united nations global compact
 as done since 2008 while it is based on the 4th revised edition version g31 2011 of the global reporting initiative gri
 guidelines for a b application level just as in the three previous editions of the report in this report we have also included the oil
  gas sector supplementary indices the gri guidelines have provided a sound basis for the selection of the material issues that
 had to be covered by the report for an effective communication with stakeholders therefore we herewith publish data for 139
 gri indicators through which we believe that we provide a complete and balanced picture of our performance on core issues

 the sustainability report 2012 is not certified by an external certification authority
