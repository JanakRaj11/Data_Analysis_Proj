                       waste

                       we look for many ways to conserve resources as a cloudbased software
                       company workiva prints very little paper at our headquarters our trash
                       goes to the ames resource recovery plant where 70 percent of the
                       waste they receive generates electricity for the municipal utility
                       in 2014 workiva generated 7981 kwh of electricity with our trash


                       in 2013 we committed to reduce our carryoff waste by 30 percent over
                       the following three years 2013 to 2015 to do so we implemented two
                       initiatives phase out disposable cups at all offices and compost a portion
                       of our food waste from the ames kitchen in 2014 we reduced the
                       average amount of trash per capita by 42 percent at our headquarters


                       we also know that electronic waste is one of the fastest growing sectors
                       of solid waste in the us and we follow strict guidelines for disposal

                             in 2014 we reduced the average amount of

how we used
wdesk to create our
sustainability report



the workiva sustainability report was created with wdesk


we started by using our integrated workbook and data
collection templates to track and gather data from multiple
sources this was especially helpful in collecting and
analyzing energy use and per capita waste on a daily basis


a wdesk word processing document was then created
to write the text data from the workbook was livelinked
within the text providing accuracy and confidence in
the collected information directed comments were
used among collaborators to clarify messages


to aid in the design and review process wdesk binders were
used across team members for commenting and markups


wdesk certifications were used to get final signoff
from multiple teams and executive management
the file was then exported from wdesk into a
format for publishing on our website
