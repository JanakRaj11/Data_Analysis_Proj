              defining csr priority areas
              in 2007 we engaged in a wideranging independent
              assessment of our csr performance starting from the
              greek region the main objectives were to evaluate our
              csr management and reporting systems with respect to
              titans values and commitments as well as stakeholders
              expectations
              the specific objectives were to
                          	identify material and relevant csr issues for titan

                               identify opportunities and risks
                               link csr issues with titans value drivers
              as part of this process four workshops and a number of
              interviews were conducted with more than 40 peo
              ple from 15 different departments and functions from
              titans operations in greece as were audits at selected
              sites covering all activities
              these workshops assessed the relative importance
              placed on various csr issues all issues have been
              examined and ranked accordingly considering their rele

the health of its employees as well as to reduce the
impact on neighboring communities and areas
further care is taken to ensure the proper maintenance
and optimal functioning of machinery and equipment
and the rigorous application of rules covering the trans
portation of materials both within the plant site as well
as outside
in 2007 specific emissions of dust were 85gton clinker
at the same level as the previous year this is equivalent
to approximately 928 tons per year
it should be noted that dust emissions in most of our
plants are two to three times below the limits set by the
environmental terms and conditions of legal require
ments

persistent organic pollutants
fuels and raw materials used may include heavy metals
as well as elements leading to the creation of persistent
organic pollutants pops such as dioxins and furans
the cement industry as shown by scientific studies has
negligible persistent pop during the last several years
titan has measured pop emissions at most of its rotat

liquid spills and solid
materials
last year we had no significant spills of liquid or solid
materials
there was however an incident in alexandria egypt
caused by dust which was emitted from our plant and
spread into the surrounding wady elkamar neighbor
hood in cooperation with local people and authorities
plant management arranged for the area to be cleaned
up within a week




transportation
we recognize that our overall footprint on the environ
ment is not caused only by our quarrying and manufac
turing operations the transportation of raw materials
and products and even our personnel also affects the
environment through carbon dioxide and other emis
sions generated by fossil fuels
measuring this kind of emissions requires a crosssec
toral approach coopareation with various automobile
industries in the framework of the eu alliance for csr
p 53 will further support our efforts to improve our
knowhow in this field and estimate indirect impacts
related to transportation of our products raw materials

noise
noise is a byproduct of industrial activity titan has
been taking appropriate measures at plants and quar

assurance report by dnv
det norske veritas hereafter dnv has been commissioned by the management of titan cement company sa
hereafter titan to carry out an independent verification of titan corporate social responsibility csr and sus
tainability report 2007 english version only hereafter the report
this is a summarised version of the assurance statement a full version of the assurance statement including details on
dnvs scope approach and specific recommendations is available online please go to wwwtitancementcom


scope
titan requested that a staged approach to verification be adopted focusing initially on its operations in greece and
expanding the coverage to eastern europe and the us in future years as a result dnvs verification was limited to ac
tivities in greece only statements regarding titans activities outside greece were not verifiedthe accuracy of selected
quantitative information was verified namely donations and employee training data our verification did not include
verification of the accuracy of co2 emissions and hs data verified by another third party
dnv was not involved in the preparation of any information or collection data included in the report


approach
dnv headquartered in oslo is one of the leading providers of sustainability solutions including verification of sustain
ability reports
the verification was carried out between june 2007 and may 2008 by suitably qualified and experienced professionals
in accordance with the dnv protocol for verification of sustainability reports which is based both on the gri g3 and
the aa1000as


conclusions
in our opinion titans csr report 2007 meets most of the wbcsdcsi global compact gri g3 and aa1000as
reporting requirements our review revealed that titans board commitment to sustainability and csr is high ti
tan has sought to identify and adopt good csr practices and this is reflected in the high level of investment on csr
management across the company environmental community and hs responsibilities have been allocated across the
company however levels of awareness capability and implementation vary across divisions and regions and business
units eg policies and systems are more effectively implemented in cement divisions than aggregates or readymix
our review confirms that titan has consistently maintained a good dialogue with local community and has responded
well to their concerns however a more structured approach to stakeholder engagement at group level is needed
regarding the content of the report the following conclusions are made


materiality
	for the first time titan has been involved in a materiality assessment whose results have informed the preparation
  of the report
	at group level titan has engaged with sri rating agencies wbcsdcsi and best practice groups with a view to
  identifying and better understanding the csr  sustainability issues which are most material to the sector


completeness
	the report includes all entities that meet the criteria of being subject to control or significant influence of the re
  porting organisation
	it is our understanding that the report provides a fair and balanced representation of titans vision performance
  and challenges during 2007


55

	assessment of data gathering processes reveal that the completeness of quantitative data reported needs further
  improvement
accuracy
	the data measurement techniques and bases for calculations have been adequately described to dnv although no
  systematic errors have been detected we have identified some manual errors which have subsequently been cor
  rected however titan is committed to continually improving the quality of data and is in the process of adopting
  a more structured data management system and process for environmental data
	some data flows are complex and involve a large number of people and tools titan is currently reviewing its data
  management processes with a view to streamlining of data flows and the improving data quality control systems


neutrality
	titans 2007 materiality assessment has been used as a basis for the production of to the report and identifying the
  issues on which emphasis should be placed and ensuring that statements on the various topics are proportionate
  to their relative materiality


comparability
	in comparison with the 2006 report the current report presents information in a format that better allows users to
  see positive and negative trends in performance on a yeartoyear basis
	titans internal database system coupled with other ongoing improvements in data management processes are
  expected to enable better comparability of data in future years 


responsiveness
	this years report has been prepared taking into consideration the findings of a structured stakeholder consultation
  exercise aimed at clarifying stakeholder opinions regarding the report
	the stakeholder engagement should be extended to a wider range of stakeholders in 2008


in dnvs opinion titans csr report 2007 generally meets the content and quality requirements of the gri g3
among the different levels defined by the gri both titan and dnv confirm that the gri a application level has
been met dnv has adopted a rigorous approach in conducting the gri application level check including the use of
related gri protocols dnv considers that a gri indicator is partially met when just one of its elements is missing dnv
also checked references to the annual report weblinks were not checked because at the time of the verification they
were not active however dnv states that the documents referenced to in the weblinks exist and are implemented in
the organisation

assurance report by kpmg
to the readers of the 2007 titan group corporate social responsibility and sustainability report


introduction
we have been engaged by titan group to provide assurance on the co2 emission data and the safety data in the 2007
titan group corporate social responsibility and sustainability report further referred to as the report the report is
the responsibility of the companys management our responsibility is to issue an assurance report on the co2 emission
data and the safety data in the report


context and scope
in the report titan group describes its efforts and progress in relation to sustainability and reporting thereon our en
gagement was designed to provide the readers of the report limited assurance on whether the 2007 co2 emission data
presented on page 16 and page 29 in the report and the 2007 safety data presented on page 16 and 23 in the report
are fairly stated procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed at determining the plausibility
of data and are less extensive than those for a reasonable level of assurance


reporting criteria
there are no generally accepted standards for reporting sustainability performance titan group applies its own internal
sustainability performance reporting criteria derived from the relevant publications of the cement sustainability initia
tive wbcsdcsi of the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd these publications are the
cement co2 protocol and the wbcsdcsi guidelines for measuring and reporting safety data it is important to view
the performance data in the context of this explanatory information we believe that these criteria are suitable in view
of the purpose of our assurance engagement


standards
we conducted our engagement in accordance with the international standard for assurance engagements isae 3000
assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information issued by the international
auditing and assurance standards board amongst others this standard requires that the assurance team members
possess the specific
knowledge skills and professional competencies needed to understand and review the information and that they com
ply with the requirements of the ifac code of ethics for professional accountants to ensure their independence


work undertaken
with regard to the information in the report we carried out the following activities
	reviewing the systems and processes for data management internal control and processing of the co2 emission
  data and the safety data
	reviewing the co2 emission data and the safety data reported by the production sites under operational control of
    titan group
	visiting two selected production sites to assess the data collection and reporting process and review the reliability
   of the reported data
	reviewing data trends and discussions with management thereto
	interviewing staff responsible for the analysis and reporting of the data and explanatory notes for co2 emission data
   and safety data



57

conclusion
based on the work described above the 2007 co2 emission data presented on page 16 and page 29 in the report
referring to the cement co2 protocol and the 2007 safety data presented on page 16 and 23 in the report referring to
the wbcsdcsi guidelines for measuring and reporting safety data do not appear to be unfairly stated
