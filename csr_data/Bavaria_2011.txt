we are gogetters but we are not impetuous                     lastly we would like to take this opportunity to mention

also ensure that sustainable business practices remain
established in our company in the future a good dialogue
with our stakeholders and bavarias own ambitions for
sustainability play a key role in this respect

following our success in 2010 we are even more moti
vated to continue in 2011 to realize our ambitions we
will have to overcome important challenges such as the
continuity and efficiency of our energy and water sup
plies making our production and supply chains more sus
tainable together with our stakeholders and dealing with
growing impact of the ageing of our employees

another challenge that we have identified is to make our
transport activities more sustainable we look forward to
working with the government to examine the possibilities
of deepening the wilhelmina canal to make it accessible
to larger barges and to provide a lasting solution to the
traffic congestion in the region

this report covers all these developments and more we
hope you enjoy reading it and would like to invite you to

23 the csr organization

the bavaria csr steering committee occupies a central position
in the process of implementing csr the steering committee
reports to the board of directors which is ultimately responsible
for csr the steering committee is chaired by the csr man
ager the other members are the director of global marketing
and retail sales nl the ceo of bavaria nv and the hr and
purchasing managers bavaria has opted for the decentralized
implementation of csr with project leaders for each theme who
report to the steering committee

this means that the various process managers are responsible
for most of the csr activities in this way human resources
for example is responsible for recruitment of people with phys
ical or mental disabilities and the purchasing division is respon
sible for carrying out risk scans with suppliers bavarias csr
manager coordinates motivates and maintains an overview of
csr in practice the board of directors is kept informed via the
steering committee the steering committee meets every four
weeks in 2011 the csr steering committee will be augmented
with the executive director for the hospitality industry

as part of the theme of energy and cli

and generating renewable energy with
our partners in 2011 in any case we
intend to do the following in this regard

     in 2011 bavaria will carry out or
      commission a study on the use of
      geothermal energy if the results
      are positive we will strive to imple
      ment the use of geothermal energy
      by 2015

     in 2011 bavaria will draw up a
      definitive carbon footprint in accord
      ance with iso140641 our co2
      emissions are currently calculated
      to be approximately 51000 tonnes
      this is the total for all production in

 reuse of waste water             water is reused in cip processes but the amount is difficult to quantify at the present
                                  time at our malt house in eemshaven approximately 70 of the water is reused
                                  bavaria is carrying out a study for the brewery in lieshout to facilitate the monitoring
                                  of water reuse

 includes all activities in lieshout including the malt house and production of other beverages

explanatory notes to the figures
the waste water purification system functioned well in 2010
 	the chemical contaminant load fell by 17 compared with 2009 primarily due to the lower nitrogen concentration
 	the chlorine and sulphate concentrations decreased as a result of the improved dosage of iron chloridesulphate in the dephosphata
    tion unit because of this the phosphorous concentration ptot did increase slightly
 	incidental transgressions of the licence norms 9 x were reported to the water board these transgressions had no or only a negligible
    effect on the progressive average
