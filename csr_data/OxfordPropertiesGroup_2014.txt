sustainable shopping centre food courts
oxford is helping to set the standard for green food courts in canada shopping centre food courts across
north america are filled with thousands of people eating their meals on styrofoam plates with nonrecyclable
utensils the meal will last a few minutes but the styrofoam will stay in the landfill for hundreds of years in
an effort to elevate and improve the dining experience for our customers and dramatically reduce waste food
central at square one and dine on 3 at yorkdale have made a commitment to eliminate disposable dishes
and cutlery in favor of customdesigned dishware there are no garbage bins customers bring their trays to
one of the stations where staff sorts the waste this handson service effectively results in 100 diversion of
recyclables and organics from landfill energy and water efficiency is also a priority through the use of high
efficiency dishwashing systems and grey water recirculation




energy efficiency at our residential properties
we are applying a number of sustainability best practices to our growing residential portfolio  best practices
we have learned from years of actively managing utility consumption in our apartments as well as expertise
we have built up from our leadership approach to sustainability at our office and retail assets one example is
at our 1101 bay apartment building in downtown toronto the property management team installed 3l toilets
and highefficiency shower heads and faucet aerators resulting in a 30 reduction in water usage with a 25
year project payback these dramatic results have led the residential team to develop plans to retrofit more
than 7000 additional suites across the residential portfolio another example is at our goldengate apartments
also in toronto twenty five boilers were replaced with high efficiency condensing boilers linked to a new
automated controls system that resulted in a 31 reduction in natural gas consumption per annum
