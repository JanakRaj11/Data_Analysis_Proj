              stronger together
    sugar starch and fruit it is thanks to the very
  diversity of our products applications in industry
that the combination of these three pillars has proved
  a solid and stable base for our company together
    the three business segments not only generate
   synergies in production and marketing but also
   create longterm growth potential independent
           of segmental market fluctuations




    sugar


       6726                          million

    revenue of the sugar segment declined by
    80 from the year before to  6726 million
    sugar sales prices especially for product
    sold to the sugarusing industry and to food
    retailers were significantly lower than in
    the prior year but growth was achieved in
    sales volumes of quota sugar particularly
    to the food industry while exports to
    countries outside the eu decreased sales
    of nonquota sugar to the chemical industry
    were held almost at the yearearlier level

                                  fruit

   10834                                million

the fruit segment successfully defied the tough
market conditions prevailing in its fruit juice
concentrates business in the 201516 financial
year sales revenue of the segment grew by
20 to  10834 million sales quantities of
fruit preparations were up slightly from the
previous year and coupled with an increase
in sales prices led to revenue growth of about
8 in this division of the fruit segment the
fruit juice concentrates division on the other
hand saw a revenue reduction of 18 as
a result of a sharp decline in selling prices for
apple juice concentrate from the 2014 crop




                               starch

   7216                        million

the starch segment delivered a robust top
line performance at  7216 million revenue
even slightly exceeded that of the prior
financial year the areas of revenue growth
included the bioethanol business which
benefited from higher selling prices and
the sector of wet starch derivatives where
sales volumes rose byproducts generated
slightly less revenue than in the prior year
as a result of lower raw material prices and
sales reductions in saccharification products
reflected the lasting low prices in a difficult
european sugar market

        acting together  the motto of our annual report reflects the winning combination of our
         three business segments that again proved itself in the completed 201516 financial year enabling
         agrana despite the challenges in the sugar segment to achieve a moderately improved operat
         ing profit ebit


        sugar segment performed its absolute best in current demanding circumstances
        201516 was another year of difficult conditions in the sugar market sales prices that were low
        all year but did not fall further after the 2015 campaign weighed on revenue and especially earn
        ings in our sugar segment the fact that we are not having to report a loss in this segment is
        an accomplishment in itself our rationalisation measures such as cost reductions in overheads
        gained traction as quickly as our investment in yield enhancement through chromatography in
        byproduct extraction of betaine and in energy efficiency

        the swings in the world market price for sugar and the fierce battle for eu market positions
        in the runup to the sugar regimes expiration at the end of september 2017 will remain dominant
        drivers for our sugar business but we have prepared well for the market liberalisation already
        command a strong presence in the deficit markets and have deep expertise in sugar and glucose
        production based on decades of experience our continuing goal is to expand our market share
        in central and eastern europe the negative impacts of the sugar market reform such as the
        testing of the economic lower price limits are already a reality while the advantages  such as
        the elimination of production caps and export restrictions  will only make themselves felt from
        the end of 2017


        acting together stronger profits in starch and fruit
        we are currently benefiting more than ever from our diversification into three pillars which
        led to a respectable consolidated earnings result for the group starch and fruit profits made up
        for the sugar segment in 201516 in fact the starch segment delivered an alltime record
        operating profit buoyed not just by its product diversity in food and nonfood starches but also
        by ethanol prices the fruit segment held its operating profit steady at the prior years level with
        the fruit preparations division also attaining its best result yet while the fruit juice concentrates
        business came in well below expectations due in part to the low apple juice concentrate prices
        from the 2014 crop


        specialties strategy and higher refining intensity
        a lasting low oil price the slowdown of the global economy with weaker growth in transition
        countries like china and brazil significant falls in commodity prices even and especially in this
        environment agrana is strategically well positioned  with competition driven purely by raw
        material purchasing prices and product sale prices our specialties strategy stands us in good stead
        we will continue to focus on this approach in the future in the starch segment in particular
        we have enormous manufacturing flexibility and can offer a very broad product portfolio thanks
        to a mix of available grades organic gmofree clean label different input species and varieties
        yellow corn waxy corn wheat potatoes a range of technologies extrusion drum drying spray
        drying slurry processes and chemical and physical modifications our products gmofree nature
        and our organics capabilities are a competitive advantage that we increasingly leverage world
        wide including in the usa where gmofree starch specialties are in growing demand we are also
        using a specialties strategy to counter the commoditisation trend in the fruit juice concentrate
        business in the sugar segment too we will expand our unique selling propositions in our region
        in terms of the brands and breadth of the sugar product range and of managing regional brand
        name products

above we are also undertaking the necessary structural      activities do for the greater economy outside our group          
adjustments and capacity expansion the way forward         we see our sugar starch and fruit segments as growth             
despite currently favourable energy and raw material         engines for the economy as a whole every euro of                 
prices is to invest in even more energyefficient proces   gross value added at agrana generates approximately

        governance the code which can be found on the website of the austrian working group for
        corporate governance at wwwcorporategovernanceat provides the framework for the direction

        order to achieve compliance with the code and of r rules recommendations noncompliance

        commitment to the austrian code of corporate governance
        agrana is committed to the provisions of the austrian code of corporate governance in the
        201516 financial year agrana applied the code in the version of january 2015 at its meetings
        on 30 november 2015 and 25 february 2016 the supervisory board of agrana beteiligungsag
        discussed matters of corporate governance and unanimously adopted the statement of com
        pliance with the code

        in the 201516 financial year agrana adhered to all c rules of the code except as explained below

           rule 27 management board compensation criteria
            the existing employment contracts of the management board members do not tie variable
            compensation to nonfinancial criteria and do not specify maximum amounts setting ceilings
            on the amount of variable compensation would reduce the flexibility to respond to unfore
            seeable developments and to honour special achievements a retroactive change to existing
            contracts does not appear justified

           rule 27a severance pay
            in the event that a management board appointment is withdrawn severance pay has been
            agreed in accordance with the provisions of the employees act the management board con
            tracts do not contain a ceiling on severance pay

        the approach in respect of rules 27 and 27a was adopted by the supervisory board and imple
        mented by the nomination and remuneration committee in the contracts of the management
        board members

           rule 49 contracts requiring approval
            under section 95 5 12 of the austrian stock corporation act the approval of the supervisory
            board is required for contracts with members of the supervisory board by which members
            undertake outside their role on the supervisory board to provide a service to the company
            or a subsidiary for a material consideration this also applies to contracts with companies
            in which a supervisory board member has a significant economic interest for business policy
            and competition reasons the object and terms of such contracts are not published in the
            annual report as stipulated in rule 49 this divergence was adopted by the supervisory board
            at the time of the initial commitment to the code of corporate governance in 2005

                                                                          corporate governance report   19

in the 201516 financial year revenue in the sugar segment decreased by 80 yearonyear to
 6726 million while sugar sales prices especially with the sugarusing industry and with resellers
food wholesalers and retailers were down significantly from the prior year growth was achieved
in the sales quantities of quota sugar particularly with the food industry sales volumes of
nonquota sugar with the chemical industry were nearly at the yearearlier level while exports
to noneu countries were down significantly revenue from byproducts receded slightly for price
reasons the sugar segment accounted for 272 of group revenue prior year 293

as expected ebit earnings before interest and taxes at  43 million also fell yearonyear from
 90 million the key negative driver was the significant decline in sugar selling prices compared
with the prior year in the first six months of the prior year higher prices were still being
received from the 201314 campaign the ebit improvement in the last six months of the 201516
financial year was attributable primarily to the yearonyear drop in the cost of raw sugar and
to the additional contribution margin from the higher sales volume

research and development

       operating in a highly competitive market environment it is vital for agrana to set market trends
       and differentiate itself from the competition through product innovations in close partnership
       with customers agranas research and development rd teams are always working on new
       recipes specialty products and innovative applications for existing products true to the groups
       strategic focus on lasting sustainable success

       the agrana research  innovation center aric in tulln austria is the groups central research
       and development institute for the starch bioethanol sugar and fruit businesses aric as a sepa
       rate company in the agrana group is a wholly owned subsidiary of agrana beteiligungsag
       the aim of the institute is to develop new applications for innovative products made from potato
       corn waxy corn wheat and sugar beet the company is active nationally and internationally
       as an inhouse rd service provider for sugar technology food technology starch and bioethanol
       technology microbiology biotechnology as well as fruit preparations product development more
       over the agrana research center also offers its specialist rd knowhow to third parties and
       acts as a stateaccredited laboratory for bioethanol analytics and sugar beet quality control

       this clustering and collaboration of rd specialists from different segments sugar starch and
       fruit under one roof not only drives administrative synergies but also promotes creative exchange
       between different groups of researchers the complementarity between the groups experience is
       particularly valuable in crosssegment areas of research such as nutrition physiology thickeners
       and aromas microbiology product quality and safety and organic products in this way the
       growing number of projects involving more than one agrana business segment can be carried

       sugar segment
       a project aimed at the potential reduction of primary energy costs was launched in connection
       with the expanded molasses desugaring plant at the sugar factory in tulln austria the plant oper
       ates by chromatographically without the use of chemicals separating molasses into a sugarrich
       fraction a betainerich one and a fraction high in ash and colour compounds while there are
       excellent utilisation opportunities for the first two fractions the existing uses of the latter residue
       which still contains a significant proportion of sugar can be diversified beyond the current options
       of feedstuff or fertiliser use

       a cooperative project with the austrian centre of industrial biotechnology acib gmbh supported
       by the comet programme of austrias research promotion agency österreichische forschungs
       förderungsgesellschaft mbh is studying the fermentative utilisation of the remaining sugar in
       this molasses residue the researchers are using a twostage process in which the residual sugar is
       digested by microorganisms to produce hydrogen and methane the goal is to build a twostage
       pilot plant in the molasses desugaring facility in tulln for studying the process over a longer time
       period if the concept proves viable and an industrialscale version is installed approximately
       30 of the primary energy requirement of the molasses desugaring plant could be met from the
       methane produced onsite

6 total paid hours worked are defined by agrana as contractual work hours plus paid overtime
7 explanation of the multiplier 200000 the multiplier is intended to make the groups internal workplace safety data
  comparable with other companies it is based on the assumption of 40 work hours per week and 50 work weeks
  per year for 100 employees 40  50  100 the effect of the multiplier is thus to convert from a companys average
  number of accidents lost days or absentee hours hours missed as a result of accident or illness per hour of work
  done in the company to an annual number per 100 employees
8 a work day is assumed to have eight hours

          sales volumes and steady revenue the probable downward price pressure in saccharification
          products and bioethanol leads to a moderately to significantly reduced ebit forecast compared

the iasb has issued the final version of ifrs 9 bringing together the results of the classification and measurement impairment and                    
hedge accounting phases of the project to replace ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement this new version of the                  
standard adds a new model of expected losses for measuring impairment and limited changes to the classification and measurement                        
requirements for financial assets the impairment model is based on the concept of providing for expected losses at the inception of                    
a contract with the exception of purchased or originated creditimpaired financial assets where expected credit losses are incorporated               
into the effective interest rate determined at initial recognition the classification and measurement model for financial assets and                   
for certain debt instruments is expanded by adding a new category fair value through other comprehensive income fvtoci as well                   
additional guidance is provided on how to apply the business model and contractual cash flow characteristics test the standard super

the standard is not relevant to agrana in view of the extremely limited group of users the european commission has not endorsed

this interim standard for adoption into eu law                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                        
ifrs 15 establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from a contract with a customer specifically it also establishes criteria for determining whether different                    
performance obligations under a contract are distinct agrana does not expect the application of the standard to have an impact on                      
the timing of revenue recognition but expects it to require expanded disclosures

ifrs 16 establishes new rules for the recognition measurement and presentation of leases the standard provides only a single
accounting model for the lessee requiring the right of use to be recognised as the asset and the obligation to be recognised as a liability         
in the balance sheet capitalisation is optional only for underlying assets with a low value and for shortterm leases with a term of less              
than twelve months agrana is evaluating the extent to which ifrs 16 applies to existing rental agreements and how the rightofuse                     
asset and the corresponding liability are to be measured for individual contracts and categories of contracts once this process is completed          
the impacts on the financial position can be estimated agrana only acts as a lessor to a very limited extent as the dual accounting                   
model of operating leases and finance leases remains in place for lessors no accounting changes are expected for agrana as a lessor                   
                                                                                                                                                        
no material impacts on the presentation of the financial position results of operations and cash flows are expected                                   

                                                                                notes to the consolidated financial statements   106




restatements in accordance with ias 8
from the beginning of the 201516 financial year the presentation of the statement of comprehensive income was
expanded by adding the line item effects from equityaccounted joint ventures within other comprehensive income
the new item represents the effects  recognised directly in equity  from equityaccounted joint ventures in the
form of ias 39 fair value movements currency translation differences and changes in actuarial gains and losses
on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities previously these effects were included in the separate
line items for ias 39 fair value movements and currency translation differences and for changes in actuarial gains
and losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities the consolidated statement of changes
in equity was adjusted by the addition of a separate column containing the corresponding amounts to be recognised
directly in equity of the ias 39 fair value movements translation differences and changes in actuarial gains and
losses on defined benefit pension obligations and similar liabilities of equityaccounted joint ventures


changes in comparative information
in the 201516 financial year currency translation gains or losses were for the first time presented on a gross basis
in operating profit ebit and in net financial items for the 201415 comparative period this adjustment led to
an increase in other operating income and other operating expenses of  5055 thousand and an increase in finance
income and expense of  41204 thousand compared to the published amounts

as a result of an expansion of the treasury management system and an associated adaptation of recording processes
gains and losses on derivatives are since 201516 presented on a gross basis for the 201415 comparative period
relative to the published amounts this led to an increase of  11935 thousand in gains on derivatives and an increase
of  32583 thousand in losses on derivatives as well as a reduction of  5130 thousand in currency translation gains
within net financial items and a reduction of  25778 thousand in translation losses in net financial items

the presentation of employee numbers was changed from a headcount basis average for the year to fulltime
equivalents average for the year

in the cash flow statement the interest taxes and dividends representing cash flows are now presented separately
and the foreign currency effects are allocated to the items to which they relate the prioryear data have therefore
been adjusted

4 consolidation methods
 acquisitions of companies that are fully consolidated are accounted for using the acquisition method in accor

dance with ifrs 3 where a business combination entails the possible recognition of intangible assets not previously
recognised in the separate financial statements of the acquired company such as customer relationships these
are recognised only when the requirements under ias 38 for capitalisation are met for acquisitions of a majority
interest rather than a 100 stake in a company ifrs 3 provides an accounting policy choice as to how to measure
the resulting noncontrolling interests the noncontrolling interests may be measured either at their proportionate
share of the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree partial goodwill method or at their proportionate share
of goodwill full goodwill method this choice is available individually for each business combination the full good
will method has not been applied in the agrana group to date

 the investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are included in the consoli

dated financial statements from the time of acquisition provided that the requirements for the application of
ifrs 11 joint arrangements are met profits or losses resulting from transactions of the agrana group with a joint
venture are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the joint venture

 intragroup revenues expenses and income and all receivables and payables or provisions between the consoli

dated companies are eliminated in assets that arise from intragroup flows of products or services and are included
in noncurrent assets or in inventories intragroup balances are eliminated

finance leases the assets rented or leased are recorded as an asset the asset is initially measured at the lower of
i its fair value at the inception of the rental period or lease and ii the present value of the future minimum
rental or lease payments this amount is simultaneously recorded as a liability under borrowings

65 emission allowances
 emission rights are accounted for in accordance with ias 38 intangible assets ias 20 accounting for govern

ment grants and disclosure of government assistance and ias 37 provisions contingent liabilities and contingent
assets emission allowances are issued for a given calendar year and are intangible assets for the purposes
of ias 38 that except as noted below are to be classified as current assets they are assigned a cost of zero from
the point when emissions exceed allocated allowances one allowance represents one tonne of carbon dioxide a
provision for co2 emissions must be established for actual additional emissions and recognised in the income state
ment the provision is calculated by taking into account the cost incurred for purchased emission allowances or
any excess of their market value at the measurement date over their cost co2 emission allowances that have already
been purchased for use in a subsequent trading period are recorded in noncurrent assets


66 impairment
 assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets are tested at every balance sheet date for evidence of

impairment goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed for impairment annually
at 31 august regardless of whether there is indication of possible impairment

 the impairment test involves determining the assets recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher

of an assets value in use and its net selling price if the assets recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount
the difference is expensed as an impairment loss in the income statement

 an assets value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the assets continuing use

and from its disposal at the end of its useful life the discount rate used in determining present value is a pretax
market rate adjusted for the specific risks of the asset concerned where no largely independent cash inflows
can be determined value in use is determined for the nextlarger unit the cash generating unit to which the asset
belongs and for which largely independent cash inflows can be determined

 where an impairment loss later decreases or is eliminated the amount of the reversal of the impairment loss

except in the case of goodwill and equitylike securities classified as availableforsale is recognised as income
in the income statement up to the lower of amortised original cost and value in use impairment losses on goodwill
are not reversed


67 employee benefit obligations
 the agrana group maintains both defined contribution and defined benefit plans for pensions and termination

benefits under the defined contribution pension and termination benefit arrangements agrana has no further
obligation after paying the agreed premium contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as an expense
when they fall due and are reported in staff costs contributions paid to government plans are treated in the same
manner as those paid to defined contribution plans as the group has no payment obligations beyond making the
contributions no provision is maintained

 the provisions for defined benefit pension termination and longservice obligations are calculated using the

projected unit credit method in accordance with ias 19 employee benefits based on actuarial valuations this
involves determining the present value of the defined benefit obligation and comparing it to the fair value of plan
assets at the balance sheet date in the case of a deficit a provision is recorded in the case of a surplus an asset
other receivable is recorded the defined benefit obligation is measured by the projected unit credit method
under this method the future payments determined on the basis of realistic assumptions are accumulated over
the period during which the respective beneficiaries acquire the entitlement to these benefits

                                                                                                         accounting policies   115




 service cost is recognised in staff costs besides the current service cost for the benefits newly earned by staff                 
every year it may also include past service cost arising from plan curtailments or changes which is recognised                      
immediately in profit or loss for the period the net interest cost for the financial year is calculated by applying the              
discount rate determined at the beginning of the year to the net pension obligation determined at that time taking                   
into account the expected payment outflows net interest is recognised in finance expense                                            
                                                                                                                                      
 actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions or from differences between previous                       
actuarial assumptions and observed outcomes are recognised directly in equity in the period in which they occur                      
along with their effect on deferred taxes with the exception of obligations for longservice awards correspondingly               
the full amount of the obligation is recognised in the balance sheet the changes in actuarial gains and losses
recognised in the respective period are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive income
actuarial gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity cannot be reclassified to profit or loss in subse

formal detailed restructuring plan has been prepared and communicated

 provisions for uncertain liabilities include among other items provisions for litigation risks onerous contracts

costs of beet receiving loading and storage and other uncertain liabilities a provision for onerous lossmaking
contracts is recognised if the expected economic benefit from a contract is less than the unavoidable cost of fulfilling
the contract


69 deferred taxes
 deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the ifrs carrying amounts of assets and liabili

ties and the tax base on consolidation entries and on tax loss carryforwards expected to be utilised significant
differences exist between the ifrs carrying amounts and the tax base for property plant and equipment inventories
and provisions deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax loss carryforwards insofar as these are expected
to be utilised within five years

 deferred taxes are calculated by the liability method under ias 12 based on the pertinent national income tax

rates consequently with the exception of goodwill arising on consolidation deferred taxes are recognised for
all temporary differences between the ifrs balance sheet and the tax base to the extent that deferred tax assets are
likely to be realised

 when income and expenses are recognised directly in equity the respective deferred tax assets and liabilities

are also taken directly to equity the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets arising from temporary
differences and from tax loss carryforwards takes into account companyspecific forecasts of for instance the future
earnings situation in the respective group company deferred tax assets are recognised only if the associated tax
benefits are expected to be realisable over a fiveyear planning horizon this is the case if sufficient profits can
be earned or if there is sufficient taxable income from the reversal of temporary differences previously recognised
as liabilities

 deferred tax assets are classified as noncurrent assets deferred tax liabilities are recorded as noncurrent liabilities

deferred tax assets are off set against deferred tax liabilities if they relate to the same tax authority

 the income tax reported represents the tax levied in the individual countries on taxable income and the

movement in deferred taxes

 in testing for impairment agrana uses a discounted cash flow method to determine the value in use of the                            
cashgenerating units the determination of expected cash ﬂows from each cashgenerating unit is based on business
plans that are validated and approved by supervisory board committees and have a planning horizon of ﬁve years
projections beyond a ﬁveyear horizon are based on the assumption of a constant inﬂationinduced growth rate                         
of 15 per year assumption in the prior year 15 the cost of capital wacc is calculated as the weighted average

 the cost of debt capital is calculated as the riskfree rate plus the country risk premium the inflation differential

 the quality of the forecast data is frequently tested against actual outcomes with the help of variance analysis

the insights gained are then taken into account during the preparation of the next annual plan projections of value
in use are highly sensitive to assumptions regarding future local market developments and volume trends value
in use is therefore ascertained both on the basis of experience and of assumptions that are reviewed with experts for
the regional markets

 the amounts by which the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying amounts were subjected to a sensitivity

the expense for the unwinding of discount on beneﬁts accrued in prior years less the return on plan assets is
included within net ﬁnancial items the current service cost is included in staff costs the change in actuarial gains
of the pension and termination benefit provisions which is recognised directly in equity was an increase of
 3225 thousand prior year losses with a decrease of  17261 thousand the change resulted primarily from the
higher discount rate and from experience adjustments concerning factors such as expected retirement age wage and
salary growth rates and assumed employee turnover rates as of 29 february 2016 net cumulative actuarial losses
of  35037 thousand prior year net losses of  38261 thousand had been offset against retained earnings not
taking into account deferred taxes

the experience adjustments reﬂect the impacts on the plan liabilities of differences between the actual movement
in the plan obligation during the year and the assumptions made at the beginning of the year such differences
arise especially from actual rates of wage and salary increases changes in pension beneﬁts employee turnover and
biometric variables such as disability and mortality


composition of plan assets
the plan assets consist primarily of investments in an external pension fund and of pension beneﬁt insurance
policies the fundamental objective for the plan assets is to provide at all times full coverage of the payment obliga
tions arising from the respective beneﬁt plans the plan assets include neither ﬁnancial instruments issued by the
group nor owneroccupied property

             deﬁned benefit plans are associated with various risks for the agrana group besides general actuarial risks such                         
             as discount rate risk and longevity risk these include the risk that actual outcomes will differ from actuarial

             early departures risks in connection with the plan assets are capital market risks credit risks and investment risks                 
             other risks lie in exchange rate ﬂuctuation and changes in inﬂation rates                                                                
                                                                                                                                                       
             the rate of return on plan assets is assumed to equal the discount rate if the actual rate of return on plan assets is                   
             less than the discount rate used the respective net liability increases the net liability is particularly strongly inﬂuenced            
             by the discount rate with the current low market interest rates contributing to a relatively high liability a further
             decline in corporate bond yields would lead to a further increase in deﬁned beneﬁt liabilities that can only be off set
             to a small degree by the increase in market values of the corporate bonds in the plan assets                                            
                                                                                                                                                       
             potential inﬂation risks that may lead to an increase in the deﬁned benefit obligations lie indirectly in inﬂationdriven               
             salary growth during active service and in inﬂationinduced pension beneﬁt increases

the currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are used to hedge cash flows over periods of up to one year
the interest rate derivatives serve to hedge cash flows for periods of one to four years

the notional amount of the derivatives represents the face amount of all hedges translated into euros as the group
currency

the fair value of a derivative is the amount which the agrana group would have to pay or would receive at the
balance sheet date in the hypothetical event of early termination of the hedge position as the hedging transactions
involve only standardised fungible financial instruments fair value is determined on the basis of quoted market
prices

fair value changes of derivatives employed to hedge future cash flows cash flow hedges are initially recognised
directly in equity only when the cash flows are realised are the value changes recognised in profit or loss at
29 february 2016 there were cash flow hedges with positive fair values of  1748 thousand prior year  588 thousand
and cash flow hedges with negative fair values of 5688 thousand prior year  69 thousand

in the financial year  588 thousand prior year  185 thousand was reclassified to the income statement and
the ineffective portion amounting to  284 thousand of cash flow hedges was recognised in profit for the period
prior year  0

the value changes of those derivative positions to which cash flow hedge accounting is not applied are recognised
in profit or loss the hedging transactions were carried out both to hedge sales revenue and raw material costs for
the juice activities and to hedge sales contracts in the sugar segment

carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments
set out in the table below are the carrying amounts and fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities
both by individual item type and by measurement category the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for
which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length
transaction

the table below also shows how the fair values were determined broken down by category of financial instrument
the fair value measurements were classified into three categories according to how closely the inputs used were based
on quoted market data

the three levels were defined as follows

   level 1 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair value represents exchange or market prices
    quoted for the exact instrument on an active market i e these prices are used without adjustment or change in
    composition
   in level 2 the fair values are determined on the basis of exchange or market prices quoted on an active market
    for similar assets or liabilities or using other valuation techniques for which the significant inputs are based on
    observable market data
   level 3 consists of those financial instruments for which the fair values are determined on the basis of valuation
    techniques using significant inputs that are not based on observable market data


the fair value of level 2 currency derivatives is measured based on the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and
the underlying currencies interest rate differential relevant for the remaining maturity the marktomarket price is
determined and compared with the price of the hedged item or transaction the input factors for this are the reference
rates of the ecb daily fixing or selected national central banks and the daily euribor and liboribor rates

for level 2 interest rate derivatives the measurement of fair value involves comparing the fixed interest rate with
the swap rates as at the balance sheet date or with the yield curve relevant for the maturity the fair value is obtained
from a separate calculation provided by banking institutions

the fair values of financial instruments were determined on the basis of the market information available at the                     
balance sheet date and using the methods and assumptions outlined below

are nonfullyconsolidated investments in subsidiaries and interests in nonlisted companies for which it was                         
chosen not to determine fair values using discounted future cash flows because this item is of minor significance for                 
the group

as a result of the short maturities of the trade receivables other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents                  
their fair values are assumed to be equivalent to their carrying amounts                                                             
                                                                                                                                      
the positive and negative fair values of commodity derivatives relate partly to cash flow hedges for the interest rate               
hedges the fair values are determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows forward foreign exchange                         
contracts are measured on the basis of reference rates taking into account forward premiums or discounts the fair                   
values of interest rate derivatives are obtained from the bank confirmations as at the balance sheet date and the fair               
values of commodity derivatives are based on official quotations on futures exchanges the market rates fair values                 
of currency derivatives are based on the forward rates determined by agrana as at the balance sheet date and                          
on the hedged exchange rates the interest rates and exchange rates used for the determination of the forward rates                   
are based on the reference rates published by the ecb or the national central banks in some cases as a result                       
of differences in interest rates the fair values determined by the group may differ to an insignificant extent from the              
fair values calculated by the commercial banks that issue the bank confirmations

for trade payables and current financial other payables it is assumed in view of the short maturities that the                      
fair values equal the carrying amounts the fair value of fixed interest liabilities is calculated as the present value               
of expected future cash flows for variable rate liabilities the fair value equals the carrying amount

the groups international business operations expose agrana to foreign exchange risks from financing and financial
investment as well as from trade receivables and trade payables to measure and control these risks the agrana
group uses valueatrisk based on the variancecovariance approach at a 95 confidence level this involves the
measurement of the various currency pairs at the given volatilities and takes into account the correlations between

var the analysis examines the implied risk from a decrease in interest rates as existing fixed rate borrowings would               
continue to incur interest costs at a constant rate instead of following the market trend the different maturities of               
fixed interest borrowings are taken into account through weighted present values and a potential change in variable
