required to put the code into
practice not only within their own                                                  environmental

our initiatives
shinko receives written questionnaires from its customers about its compliance with the code of conduct we
decided to undergo an audit by an eiccdesignated auditor based on a customer request so since the second
half of fy2012 we had reviewed our systems based on the code
      the audit was conducted over five days in may 2013 at three plants kohoku wakaho and takaoka
auditors checked our internal management systems and the status of initiatives based on the code onsite
investigations of plant facilities including the cafeteria and
interviews with many employees selected at random during
the interviews auditors verified working conditions and our
compliance with the code
    the audit results were extremely positive leading to a high
commendation from the customer that had requested it


future plans
one reason for the high marks we received is that the corporate
vision embodied in the shinko way and our initiatives based on it
were basically consistent with the eicc code of conduct the
audit has enabled us to confirm that our initiatives thus far are in
line with global trends
      at the same time we recognized the need for
improvements on a number of points going forward we will
strive to meet the expectations of our stakeholders and improve
our corporate value even further by continuing and expanding
initiatives in accordance with the code of conduct while
                                                                             the chairmans message on the eicc
