     we recognize the importance of total risk management                  the de ratio3 as an important indicator of financial health
     in an age where external business conditions change at                finally we are using our own internal wacc4 which
     lightning speed we established the risk management                   incorporates an optimum de ratio as an indicator of the
     committee in april 2013 to oversee risk management across             hurdle rate for internal investment decisions

     profit which we will continue to use as an indicator of

           have a particularly strong aspiration to contribute to society   ceaselessly exposed to towering waves and deep troughs is
           from now on companies are likely to be all the more pressed      worthy of mention for the company there has been no other
           by the need to pursue their own development in areas where        way but to incessantly make an utmost offort for survival and
           social contribution and the pursuit of profit overlap for this   it is likely that this effort has fostered the companys good
           reason the future of companies depends on how they nurture       fortune iino lines will continue to challenge the rough seas
           young employees to be sure since these are times fraught        of the transportation business i hope to see everyone share
           with uncertainty nurturing of employees is difficult however   the joy of having achieved the companys desired results when
           by weathering the storm employees can emerge all the             the new midterm management plan announced in april 2017
           more disciplined precisely because these are difficult times     is finally completed
           human resources development cannot be accomplished

                                                                        in certain respects be out of step with the times i think that
       in recent years blue chip companies that were once thought      this is another area of engagement for outside directors
       unsinkable have one after another faced management
       crises it has been pointed out that something these             my expectations of iino lines
       companies have in common is that information about the




                                                                                                                                              safety and environment
       causes of the crises had been unevenly distributed reaching     the company has two main pillars the real estate business
       only some executives if information had been shared among       and the shipping business the former is a domestic
       board of directors members at an early stage timely and         demanddriven business with stable earnings prospects
       appropriate information disclosure may have occurred and         and the latter is an external demandcentered business
       a clue to a solution found while the damage was still minor     that profits by taking certain risks operating these two
       to the extent that outside directors are unconstrained by the    businesses in tandem enables the company to engage
       past they in particular could have quickly sounded an alarm    in balanced management at a time of an unparalleled
       i think that iino lines has proactively engaged in               downturn in the domestic and oceangoing shipping                      society

       information sharing during the two years that i have so          industries with some companies posting huge losses i think
       far served as an outside director and i am convinced it          that iino lines has engaged in comparatively sound if not
       will continue to do so i want to further increase my own        ideal business management
       sensitivity to information                                      however there is substantial risk in maintaining stability
                                                                                                                                              communication




       for one thing i make a point of always questioning the          in a mediumsize business if a seismic event occurs in the
       conventional wisdom within iino lines a company with            business environment i think it is important to expand the
       more than a century of history companies form conventional      business scale and seek enhancement of business value
       wisdom based on many factors conforming to conventional         however at a time of increasingly fierce competition this
       wisdom saves on thinking time and makes it possible to           is no simple matter in any case steadily realizing scale
                                                                                                                                              corporate information




       swiftly make appropriate decisions however conventional        expansion requires a considerable force of highly talented
       wisdom must be constantly reviewed since changing times          people a plan bereft of means stands no chance of success
       may cause it to diverge from reality and insiders tend to be    of course iino lines has elite employees and human
       late in recognizing this since coming to iino lines i have     relations among the employees seem to be good i truly
       been frequently made aware that the conventional wisdom          hope that the company skillfully operates a training and
       i believed for many years isnt necessarily true i think that   evaluation system that will develop human resources with
       the way to overcome this malady is for outside directors to      unusual talent people who will forge ahead into the business
       repeatedly ask simple even naïve questions                    world with unrivalled power




                                                                                                                   iino report 2017                       44
