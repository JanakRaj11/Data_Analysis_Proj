independent assurance report




during our investigation we discussed the necessary amend
ments in the csr sections with tno and have established that
these amendments were properly incorporated in the definitive
version

our conclusion
our work reveals no evidence that the information in the csr
sections in every aspect of material import is incorrectly
represented according to the g3 guidelines of the global
reporting initiative

comparative information has not been examined
no assurance assignment has been performed for the
comparative csr information concerning previous years as
contained in the csr sections therefore we can give no
assurance about this csr information included for the sake
of comparison

observations
without compromising the scope of our assurance report we
would like to draw the readers attention to the following finding
tno has brought tangibility to its csr policy in the past year
by stipulating this in a corporate social responsibility policy
statement we instruct tno to link goals and kpis to this so
that the progress of these goals can be monitored we also
instruct an evaluation of the current methodologies like the
environmental footprint model to provide sufficient insight to
enable adjustments to be made

comply with dutch requirements including no armed uranium
so defence asked tno and rheinmetall waffe munition schweiz
rwms to codevelop suitable munitions the fap frangible
armour piercing projectiles which are brittle and fracture into
smaller pieces within a target work in a very complex way but
accumulated knowledge has given tno the capacity not only
to evaluate such munitions but also to help develop them tno
and partner rwms were thus able to come up with entirely new
25 mm fap munitions so if the jsf is eventually purchased
the necessary munitions will be ready on time not only that but
the american air force is currently testing these munitions and
contributing to part of the costs and should the americans and
other countries decide to actually purchased these munitions in
the future then for every cartridge sold royalties will flood in to
tno for reinvestment in defence research and defence
