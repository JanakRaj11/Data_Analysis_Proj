            3 operational environment

                   42       business model and performance indicators
            		               the following should be read as an amplification of the groups formal investment policy
            		421 strategy
            			v	our aim is to maintain and grow a portfolio of equity interests in a spread of industrial
                  service and financial businesses with sound growth records or potential for growth that will
                  generate cash and earn above average returns on capital over a period
            			v	our interests in unlisted companies will usually be large minority holdings with sizeable
                  interests held by management or by founding family shareholders with whom we interact as
                  partners
            			v	we also hold listed investments where we are represented on the boards andor where
                  directors or material shareholders are known to us
            			v	we may hold equity investments that are small in percentage terms but where we are able
                  to exert influence through board representation or shareholder agreements conversely we
                  may hold majority or joint controlling interests but without direct management responsibility
                  accordingly we participate in good businesses with firstclass management without being
                  restricted by a required size of holdings
            			v	our approach to our investments is similar to that of a diversified holding company however
                  each business in which we are invested is free standing in financial terms ringfenced as to risk
                  and separately assessed
            			v	we wish to hold a meaningful level of investments in international currencies directly or
                  indirectly
            			v	we do not follow a trading approach to our primary holdings we do not acquire or dispose
                  of investments in accordance with a private equity philosophy nor are we constrained by any
                  required balance between listed and unlisted holdings we hold our investments on a long
                  term basis subject only to continual review of the quality of the underlying businesses and to
                  any constraints or obligations in shareholder agreements or jse closed periods

            		v	metrofile produced slightly lower growth in earnings than in prior years its share price was stable
                 during the period
            		v	torre industries share price fell materially due to poor operating performances across the group and
                 in particular in the divisions affected by weakness in the mining and industrial sectors
            		               prospects are satisfactory once activity in these sectors improves

            7 future strategic and financial outlook
            	there has been no change in the groups financial targets or any of its strategies or its business model as described
              in this report
            	we do not anticipate any change in the groups risk profile or risk appetite and we continue to assess new
              opportunities on a regular basis
            	the groups unlisted industrial investees are budgeting for improved profitability in 2017 but this may be affected
              by any strengthening of the rand and weaker trading conditions
            	most of the groups listed investee companies are performing to expectations except for those trading in the
              industrial and mining sectors in africa where performance is difficult to project it is obviously not possible to
              project likely listed share prices
                   overall we anticipate a satisfactory year in 2017

               be aware of unpublished price sensitive information in addition there are closed periods where dealings
               are not permitted these commence at the end of the interim and final reporting periods until the release
               of the groups results and at any time when sabvest has issued a cautionary announcement
            		sabvests directors and sabvest are similarly restricted relative to any listed investments it may have from

               his personal capacity

               listed investees

               of internal audit services to the group and by deloitte  touche in the course of its audit in view of the
               size of the group a separate it charter and policies would not improve the reliability and monitoring of
               the current it functions the board and audit committee continue to monitor the effectiveness of the
               internal controls over the it environment which is currently adequate for the companys strategic plans
               and business model similarly no it steering committee is required the design and maintenance of the

               preparing sabvests regulatory universe in south africa the board through the audit committee also
               relies on deloitte  touche in the course of their audit relating to compliance with applicable legislation
               and regulations
            		the cfo in discharging the compliance function also monitors compliance with the groups code of
               ethics and the risk management process
            		during the year the compliance officer did not note any breaches in regulatory compliance and the group
               was not subject to any penalties or fines in this regard
            		the board does not believe it is necessary for sabvest as an investment holding company to adopt formal
               dispute resolution processes external disputes are handled through the groups attorneys and there have
               been no occasions of internal disputes over the years the board regards the compliance function as
               sufficient and effective

            		the board is comfortable with the level of combined assurance obtained from management the audit and
               risk committee the external auditors and the internal audit service provider relative to the groups key risks
               and its control environment the board is of the view that all of the risks listed have been mitigated to the
               extent feasible and that all residual risks have adequate controls or are monitored closely the board is not
               aware of any impending material risks that have not been disclosed herein
            		nothing has come to the attention of the audit committee or the board that has caused them to believe
               that the groups system of internal controls and risk management is not effective

            9 remuneration policy
            	the remuneration and nominations committee ensures that the remuneration of executives and staff is
              competitive
                   sabvests policy is to pay cost to company packages in the upper quartiles for comparable positions
            	shortterm incentives for executives are targeted at between 50 and 150 of cost to company packages in the
              case of the ceo 25 of package is awarded if normal dividends over the three year period to the accounting
              date have increased by at least 10 pa and the second award is calculated as 2 of pat 2017  25 the
              cfo may earn 25 of package based on preset qualitative kpis and the balance of his incentive is calculated
              as 1 of pat the awards based on pat are not capped
            	sabvest has a longterm incentive plan ltip for executives and staff participants receive a notional award
              of between 15 and 100 of their cost to company packages annually which is invested in the groups net
              asset value the growth in this notional investment is measured annually and is tested after four years an award
              will only vest if a hurdle rate of 10 per annum growth in net asset value is achieved there is no retesting
              adjustments are made to account for the notional reinvestment of dividends the awards are cash settled and
              accounted for in profit and loss annually the awards are not capped
                   awards prior to 2012 had testing periods of 3 to 5 years
            	accordingly when the shortterm incentive scheme and the ltip are viewed together most of the potential
              annual incentive to executives is based on growth in nav per share over one year and over four years and the
              balance on the growth in dividends

      managements interests are also aligned with those of shareholders relative to share prices
	both executive directors are shareholders in the company and have previously received allocations from the share
  trust or the sars scheme
	accordingly the bases for shortterm incentives and the ltip combined with the previous allocation of shares to
  executive directors directly motivate management to achieve growth in sabvests key performance indicators
      the sars share trust and share option schemes are currently dormant
	some of the directors who take the responsibility of appointments to the boards of the groups investees may
  receive directors fees from some of those companies in addition the groups three unlisted investees pay
  consulting fees directly to sabvest
	the ceo holds certain nonexecutive directorships independently and not as a representative of the group
  these enhance the groups influence improve the groups access to new investments and result in income to the
  group from time to time the ceo retains the fees from those appointments
	nonexecutive directors receive annual fees for their roles as directors as board committee members and for
  sitting on the boards of investees on behalf of the group the board does not regard separate attendance fees
  as appropriate or necessary unless the time allocation to meetings expected of directors is materially more than
  normal in a particular year
      the company secretarial function has been outsourced and is charged to the group on a time basis

10 shares and shareholders
	at the yearend sabvest had 171m ordinary shares and 289m n ordinary shares in issue the ordinary shares
  carry 500 votes per share and the n ordinary shares carry 1 vote per share
	sabvest had 559 shareholders at the yearend as profiled in annexure 2 the shareholdings of directors are
  recorded in the directors report on page 35

11 commentary and conclusion
	performance will be improved through encouraging and facilitating the growth of the groups unlisted investment
  companies and by the continued realigning of the investment portfolio to realise investments in any under
  performing entities and to reallocate those funds within the portfolio sabvest targets to be fully invested to optimise
  returns and to enhance returns on capital by maintaining a level of borrowings although at a conservative level
      shareholders are referred to section 7 for the outlook for the financial year

 key audit matter                                  how the matter was addressed in the audit
 maintainable earnings are derived from            we assessed the earnings and earnings multiples used and found
 the financial statements and budgets of           the basis of determination consistent with prior year resulting in a
 the underlying investments and earnings           conservative yet appropriate fair value
 multiple is derived from market data by          we found the overall valuation and disclosure of the investments to
 nature these assumptions require significant     be appropriate
 judgement and is therefore considered to be
 a key audit matter


other information
the directors are responsible for the other information the other information comprises the directors report audit
committees report and company secretarys certificate as required by the companies act of south africa which
we obtained prior to the date of this auditors report and the integrated report which is expected to be made available
to us after that date the other information does not include the consolidated and separate financial statements and
our auditors report thereon
our opinion on the consolidated and separate financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon
in connection with our audit of the consolidated and separate financial statements our responsibility is to read the other
information and in doing so consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated and
separate financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated
if based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors
report we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information we are required to report that fact
we have nothing to report in this regard

responsibilities of the directors for the consolidated financial statements
the directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated and separate financial
statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards and the requirements of the companies
act of south africa and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated and separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error
in preparing the consolidated and separate financial statements the directors are responsible for assessing the groups
and the companys ability to continue as a going concern disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group andor the
company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so

auditors responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated and separate financial statements
as a whole are free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors report that
includes our opinion reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted
in accordance with isas will always detect a material misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated and separate financial statements
as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism
throughout the audit we also
	identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated and separate financial statements
   whether due to fraud or error design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit
   evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material
   misstatement resulting intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal control
	obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
   appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
   groups and the companys internal control
                                                                                                                                     33

accounting policies
for the year ended 31 december 2016




accounting policies

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs
the requirements of the companies act no 71 of 2008 saica financial reporting guides as issued by the accounting
practices committee and financial pronouncements as issued by the financial reporting standards council they
have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value
or at amortised cost the significant accounting policies and methods of computation are consistent in all material
respects with those applied in the previous financial year

the group has also adopted the revised or amended accounting standards issued by the international accounting
standards board iasb and the ifrs interpretations committee ifric which were effective and applicable to the
group from 1 january 2016 the application of these changes had no impact on the groups financial results for the
period

the principal accounting policies adopted are set out below

basis of consolidation

the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the
company its subsidiaries at 31 december each year control occurs where the company has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities

on acquisition the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value any
excess of the cost at acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill if
the cost is less than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired ie a discount on acquisition this difference is
credited to profit or loss in the period of acquisition

all intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation

investments

all investments are accounted for at fair value in terms of investment entities

where investments are listed equities fair value is calculated as market value should the disposal of any investment be
restricted then the market value is reduced by a discount to arrive at fair value gains and losses arising from changes in
the fair value are included in the statement of comprehensive income for the period on disposal of the investments the
profit or loss is accounted for as the difference between the consideration received and the fair value of the investment
at the commencement of the financial year

where investments are unlisted equities fair value is calculated using the maintainable earnings model maintainable
earnings are based on historic and projected net operating profit after tax nopat earnings as appropriate the
multiples are selected after considering peer group multiples and adjusting as appropriate the resultant valuations are
then adjusted for net cash or net debt balances they may be measured for reasonableness against net asset value if this
is a relevant metric recent transaction prices andor discounted cash flow dcf valuations

for other unlisted investments fair value is determined using an appropriate valuation model

            finance advances and receivables accounts payable and borrowings

            equity instruments issued are recorded as the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

            accounts payable are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
            effective interest rate method

            changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges
            are recognised in other comprehensive income amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the statement of
            comprehensive income in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction affects net
            profit or loss

            interestbearing loans and overdrafts are recorded as the amounts of the proceeds received net of direct raising costs
            finance charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are accounted for on an accrual basis and
            are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they
            arise

            originated loans and receivables are measured initially at cost the loans and receivables are measured subsequently at
            amortised cost using the effective interest rate method if the terms of a loan or receivable are not marketrelated the
            payments are discounted at a marketrelated rate to determine the fair value at initial recognition

            cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other shortterm highly liquid investments
            that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value offset
            by other current interestbearing debt

            longterm investments are measured at fair value they are recognised as being held for trading purposes and gains or
            losses in fair value are included in the statement of comprehensive income for the period where investments are listed
            equities the fair value is calculated using market value and where the investments are unlisted equities the fair value is
            calculated using inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly

            on disposal of investments the profit or loss is accounted for as the difference between the consideration received and
            the carrying value of the investment and is included in the statement of comprehensive income

            redeemable or callable reset bonds purchased to hold to maturity or to callreset dates are recognised at cost any
            surplus or discount to the maturity or call values are accounted for over the period to maturitycall and the investments
            are accounted for accordingly the carrying values calculated on this basis are regarded as appropriate estimates of fair
            value at the reporting date

            specific impairment provisions or debt writeoffs may be deducted from finance advances and receivables or investments
            where in the opinion of the directors taking into account that as a result of one or more events that occurred after
            the initial recognition of the asset the estimated future cash flows from the asset have been impacted recoverability is
            doubtful or unlikely

environment in which the entity operates its functional currency for the purpose of the consolidated financial
statements the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in rands which is the functional currency of
the company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements

in preparing the financial statements of the individual entities transactions in currencies other than the entitys
functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions
at the end of each reporting date monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates
prevailing at the end of each reporting date nonmonetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the date when the fair value was determined nonmonetary items
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated

exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and on the retranslation of monetary items are
included in profit or loss for the period exchange differences arising on the retranslation of nonmonetary items
carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of

            impairment provisions

            associate companies and investments are considered annually for impairments in value if in the opinion of the
            directors there is an impairment an impairment provision is deducted from the carrying value of the associate company
            or investment impairment provisions created or reversed during the year are written offwritten back through the
            statement of comprehensive income where there is a reversal of an impairment loss the asset is increased to the
            estimated recoverable value which will not be greater than the carrying value had no impairment loss been recognised
            in the prior years

            at the end of each reporting date the group reviews the carrying amounts of its other tangible assets to determine
            whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss if any such indication exists the
            recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any

            recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use

            if the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount the carrying amount of the asset
            is reduced to its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss

            where an impairment loss subsequently reverses the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is increased to
            the revised estimate of its recoverable amount but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
            amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cashgenerating unit
            in prior years a reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the relevant asset is
            carried at a revalued amount in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase

            provisions

            provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event it
            is probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount
            of the obligation

            a provision for the longterm incentive plan ltip measured annually and calculated on the growth in the notional
            investments is expensed annually and the total amount expected to be paid is shown as a liability

            the amount recognised as a provision is a best estimate of the consideration to settle the obligation at the reporting date
            taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation

            revenue recognition

            revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to
            the group and the amount of revenue can be reliably estimated

            dividends from investments are recognised when the right to receive payment is established

            interest is recognised on a time proportion basis

            capitalisation shares elected in lieu of a cash dividend are accounted for in investment income at the cash dividend
            equivalent

lease agreements

rentals payable under lease agreements entered into for premises occupied by the group are expensed on a straightline
basis over the term of the relevant lease

related party transactions

all related party transactions are unless otherwise disclosed at arms length and are in the normal course of business
refer to note 20

retirement benefits and medical aid schemes

payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged and expensed as they fall due

taxation

income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax

the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the
statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible the groups liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period

deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit

deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill
or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that
affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit

deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries associates
longterm and shortterm investments and interests in joint ventures except where the group is able to control the
reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable
future

the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each end of the reporting period and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered

deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset
realised deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss except when it relates to items charged or credited directly
to equity in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity

            deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against
            current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends
            to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis
