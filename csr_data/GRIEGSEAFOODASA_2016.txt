    research shows that norwegian farmed salmon is
    safe

    the norwegian institute of nutrition and seafood research nifes
    carries out the monitoring on behalf of the food safety authorities in
    2013 nifes concluded in the report farmed fish are safe foods that

    there are no traces of illegal medicines in farmed fish and no findings
    of legal drugs organic pollutants or heavy metals above the limit

    it is also significant that in december 2014 the norwegian scientific
    committee for food safety vitenskapskommiteen for mattrygghet vkm
    concluded that

    farmed fish have less residues than wild fish and that there are no
    longer any reasons to believe that fertile women and girls should limit
    their consumption of oily fish from a health perspective

sealice control




in short sea lice management is paramount to secure longterm sustainability of the
industry


why it is important to us
dealing with lice is high on our stakeholders agenda due to
the potential negative impact on wild populations and farmed      value chain for sealice control
salmons health and welfare alike treating lice is also cost
and resource intensive and high levels imply lower productivity   purchases                  fish farming
and quality improper handling of lice can lead to resistant
lice which again could lead to natural constraints on future        quality criteria for      preventive health measures and

our main principles
lice levels shall stay below norwegian authorities limits in
all our fish farms in norway we also strive to comply with the
same standard in our operations in other countries to ensure
compliance we strive always to be ahead of lice outbreaks
through continuous monitoring and response delousing
efforts should also be balanced with a focus on fish welfare
and avoiding resistance we therefore prioritise nonchemical
delousing methods when possible for the best possible
shared response we will also focus on local cooperation
coordination and transparency with other participants

our efforts and results
a key step in our efforts to prevent and treat against lice is
the statutory systematic monitoring of sea lice levels in all
our fish farms the salmon are checked for lice every week at
water temperatures above 4 c at water temperatures below
4 c lice are counted every other week out of consideration
for fish health and welfare due to less pressure with regards

we work continuously to prevent escapes in order to facilitate
this work we will ensure high technical standards on our
locations though longterm investments and necessary
resources on the sites we will continue to work with routines
and build the relevant competencies and capacities

our efforts and results
the norwegian authorities have established strict demands
for producers regarding escape prevention we work
continuously in order to meet these demands and this is
also part of the requirements in the globalgap which we
comply with and asc that we work towards in finnmark
we have throughout the year had strong focus on good risk               our continuous efforts to prevent escapes give results and
assessments practices and procedures in shetland we have              in 2015 grieg seafood had zero escapes in all entities see
ongoing replacement of equipment when required to ensure               table3
the facilities meet the appropriate standards we have also
continued efforts to improve facility control and training for          our ambitions and goals
our employees working with net bags in order to prevent                 our goal is zero occurrences of escaped fish an important

additional inspections are also carried out after periods of            ensure a systematic approach to reporting near occurrences

attend courses on escaping once every two years at minimum             work to learn from internal and external best practice
new employees also receive risk and procedural training with            and make sure that we make the necessary investments

marine ingredients in fish feed
we have a continuous dialogue with our feed suppliers in order to ensure that the feed is
based on sustainable raw materials




why it is important to us
feed is an important input in salmon production and
largely contributes to the farming industrys total impact on
                                                                        value chain for sustainable feed
environment and society it is important for us that all the
input factors used in the feed are based on raw material from
                                                                    purchases
sustainable sources and that the manufacturing is based on             sustainability criterias and
good ethical principles it is positive that major players in the        certification of feed
industry take sustainability seriously and as a consequence            traceability through
we see a very good development within the industry fish feed            fishtalk
has traditionally been based on fishmeal and fish oil from
wild fish and the control of the various fisheries has been of
mixed quality one focus area for the industry has therefore
been using marine raw materials in a sustainable way

especially important is the proportion of wild fish used an
increasing number of fisheries have made an effort and
improved the balance between recruitment in stocks and
catches while the marine content in salmon feed has been
significantly reduced it is also encouraging that more
and more of the marine raw materials come from both by
products from processing products and bycatches the most
important consideration now is the balance between marine
oils in the feed and omega 3 levels in fish and to ensure that
landbased raw materials are also produced in a sustainable
way

our main principles
we will focus on the use of sustainable feeds in all our
regions and sites both in terms of marine and land produce
