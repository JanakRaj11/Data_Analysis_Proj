     arent the current disaster prevention initiatives seen from a     other organizations stores are a physical facility for all of   as they are not very widely known                                  objective as it approaches are limited but large goals set for
     different perspective than a standpoint on climate change         us if the capabilities of organizations and people active       kanamaru                                                           the future can be seen by many i know we must seriously
     the aeon eco project itself can be seen as mitigation and          as pillars of the community can effectively combined the        i am worried about overfishing and the depletion of trees           consider what major goals we should set for 2050 we will
     adaption climate change measures reducing the amount              community would be a safer and more secure place with            and fish i am sincere in our efforts to protect resources and      advance our initiatives using todays dialog as a reference
     of energy used at stores and generating renewable energy           greater convenience                                             provide a stable supply of these commodities                       i look forward to your continued strict evaluation of aeon
     are mitigation measures while disaster prevention facilities       tomita                                                          kawaguchi                                                          thank you very much
     at 100 locations could fall under adaption measures               disaster prevention cannot be done by aeon alone and             additionally aeon handles organic and fair trade products
     conventional initiatives at japanese companies are                 requires the cooperation of municipals and community             as a private brand i was surprised i was already able to buy
     founded on mitigation measures yet overseas companies              involvement i believe this is a core element to create a        these products at a convenient store i hope to promote
     put their effort behind adaption measures for example            local ecosystem aeon should probably further awareness          expansion of these ethical products and examine the
     these adaption measures measure how much fuel and light            of its presence with the local community by moving this          methods able to facilitate ethical consumption from
     expenses will raise due to the effects of global warming to        initiative forward this direction is extremely important from   purchase to disposal i agree with hidemi tomita that we
     use in store designs safeguards from procurement risks are        the perspective of integrating business and csr what will       need to engage our customers in efforts to reduce waste
     also important aspects of adaption measures for example          be brought about by further deepening this effort we can        as one additional point i expect human resource
     how does a company respond to risks like drought caused            expect further development                                      initiatives big challenge 2020 addresses the expansion of

     climate change is a business risk but companies have a            this would mean aeon would quickly transition from               to social issues however is there any potential to employ
     chance if they adapt                                              a retailer the company would stand as a type of local           the roughly 1500000 neets and people withdrawn

     i think the 100 prevention facilities is an excellent activity    different from a store lined with products for sale aeon        be significant to society if aeon was able to provide a
     is this part of the local ecosystem initiative large facilities   would first be a place that brings people together this         workplace with employment training
     such as aeon malls will fulfill various functions where stores     would give the opposite impression of a place with stores        tomita
     are part of the town in the future one of these many              selling daily necessities wouldnt this give birth to a new     as i have said before i would like activities to be further

     as mr tomita said disaster prevention is also one element        changes to the word of retailer as an industry of peace         one consumer who visits aeon stores i feel a great chance
     of the local ecosystem however disaster prevention is            humanity and local communities which aeon has stated in          missed for the lack of communication with the customers
     advancing as a priority in each region as disaster prevention     the principles for its business                                 on these sales floors at the markets today an increased
