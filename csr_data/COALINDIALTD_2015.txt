maximize dispatch of crushed  sized coal to the consumers in addition the washeriesat bccl ccl
wcl and ncl have adequate crushing  sizing facilities to the tune of about 368 million tonnes cil
has also initiated action to establish 15 more coal washeries with combined capacity of 1126 m te

iii measures like picking of shale  stone selective mining by conventional mode by using dozers and
graders as well as by surface miners adopting proper blasting procedure  technique for reducing the
possibility of admixture of coal with overburden materials improved fragmentation ie sizing of coal
etc are being taken for improving coal quality

iv surface miners have been deployed for extraction of coal at large nos opencast mines to improve
the quality of coal actions are being taken for deployment of more and more surface miners in open
cast mines where geomining condition permits at present 56 surface miners have been deployed in
cil at opencast mines which are working satisfactorily

v joint sampling system is in vogue for major consuming sectors eg power utilities as well as
captive steel cement sponge iron covering more than 95 of total production of cil on overall
basis large consumers having annual quantity of 040 mtes or more and having fsa have been
covered under sampling

vi for more transparency in the system independent 3rd party sampling and analysis was introduced
from 1st october 2013 subsidiary coal companies have already procured 121 bomb calorimeters
for more accuracy and transparency in results of coal sample analysis the sampling and analysis
are being done in the presence of costumers as per provision of fsa at loading end and based on the
results the costumers are paying the bill of coal as per analysed grades

during 201415 the achievement of grade conformity in respect of sampling was to the tune of
9717 for supply of coal to power sector

vii pursuant to the decision taken in the meeting with the association of power producers during
june 2014 on and above the existing system of coal sampling at the loading end it was decided that
power producers may also engage their third party agency from a list 25 empanelled agencies for
taking part in drawing coal samples and analysing the same

in view of the above pus  ipps have started selecting agencies wef december 2014 onwards and
finalised them except a few who in the process of finalising the same

viii electronic weighbridges with the facility of electronic print out have been installed at rail
loading points to ensure that coal dispatches are made only after proper weighment for this purpose
coal companies have installed 157 rail weighbridges in the railway sidings and 569 road
weighbridges for weighment of trucks coal companies have also taken actions for installation of
standby weighbridges to ensure 100 weighment

ix 24 automatic samplers are also working in subsidiary coal companies for coal sampling for bulk
consumers eliminating biasness in sampling process procurement of further amss are under process

x in order to ensure consumer satisfaction and resolve consumer complaints special emphasis has
been given to quality management and redressal consumer complaints 9944 of consumers

the various types of pollution generated in coal india coal mines are
    air pollution
    water pollution
    noise pollution
    land degradation

hence various measures being taken to mitigate environmental impacts are as follows
1 air pollution control
air quality

when it comes to coal mining dust is the only major source of air pollution as there are no chemicals
involved in the operations the total particulate matter includes dust size from 0 micron to 100 micron
is assessed using emission rate for different mining activities like drilling in coal  ob blasting of
coal  ob loading of coal  ob transportation of coal  ob unloading of coal  ob crushing of
coal at chp and loading of coal at railway siding for dispatch to power plants  other consumers

the emission rate has been developed by cmri dhanbad under funding of moef goi the
emission rate for different mining activities is different the total particulate matter has been
calculated at coalface for the activities like drilling blasting loading etc and loading  unloading at
chp and at railway siding that is subsequently lifted from the ground for dispatch to the consumers
and hence not necessary that the total estimated tpm becomes air borne which is harmful for the
health of human being and animals

as per the stipulations of moef the monitoring of particulate matters up to 10 micron and 100
micron are being done in and around the mine areas residential and village areas values of the
parameters are in mostly found within the limit of the stipulated standards however if there is any
                                                                 increasing trend of the parameters

effective plantation in the mine lease area has been done to arrest the propagation and dispersion of
dust significantly cil is having drills fitted with dust extractors
other pollutants of coal mining activities are generally sox oxide of sulphur and nox oxides of
nitrogen due to use of the explosives in blasting exhausts of machineries deployed for mining and
vehicles used for transportation of coal and ob these parameters are also monitored regularly and
found to be within the specified limits  standards
controlled blasting  planning of residential colonies  habitation away from the mines as far as
possible are also some of the measures taken

the quality of ambient air in and around the mine is monitored every fortnight as per environment
protection amendment rule
2 water pollution control
the waste from the mines is treated by settling arrangements before let out most of the opencast
mines have installed dewatering pumps on floats and this system allows pumping only clean and
settled water the treated water is used for water supply to the residential colonies to some adjoining
villages and surplus water for
agricultural purposes also
the effluent from workshops is treated
in workshop effluent treatment plants
wetps and domestic effluents from
some major residential colonies are
treated in the domestic effluent
treatment plants detps and in other
small residential colonies septic tanks
have been constructed the quality of
discharge and effluent water is also
monitored every fortnight as per
environment protection amendment
rule
the closed water recirculation system
has been adopted in the washeries to
stop the discharge of outside the premises and minimise water requirement the treated water is used
for water sprinkling in coal transfer points good housekeeping and plantation for overall improvement

water conservation initiatives

abandoned quarry voids are used as water harvesting structure for recharge of ground water water
treatment plants wtp operational under integrated water supply schemes and small scale water
filtration units for domestic supply are existing

surface water sources are mostly not affected due to the withdrawal of water from our operations
pumped water from mines is recycled for domestic  industrial consumption and supplied to
surrounding villages remaining water wherever feasible is stored in the mine voids  reservoirs and
used for aquifer recharging etc

in order to conserve rain water and replenish the ground water reservoir six 6 rain water harvesting
proposals were constructed as a sd activity

3 noise pollution control measures

   noise pollution is generated due to hemm deployment workshops chps and due to blasting
   operations this is reduced by 
      a proper maintenance of equipment
      b green belt provided around the mine as well as residential area 
      c controlled blasting  blasting in day time
      d use of surface miner  high wall mining which extract coal without blasting
      e ear muff or ear plugs provided to workers working in extremely noisy areas

4 land reclamation and remote sensing survey for monitoring
    coal mining activities need to use land and generates some impacts on environment since mining
   involves removing the top earth to dig out the coal ecofriendly mining systems have been put in
   place in all of its mining areas

we are committed to restore the degraded land and the mined out areas this is being done by
technically reclaimed mined out areas and subsequently biological reclamation by plantation on the
technically reclaimed areas cil introduced stateoftheart satellite surveillance to monitor land
reclamation and restoration for all opencast projects 50 major ocps excavating more than 5 mm³
coal  ob per annum are being monitored every year while remaining ocps excavating less than 5
mm³ coal  ob per annum are being monitored once in 3 years this gives a clear picture of land
reclamation which otherwise is difficult to estimate satellite surveillance indicates the increase in
plantation area from 1583 km2 in 201011 to 16319 km2 in 201314 this information is available in

5 coal washeries

cil has decided to set up 15 washeries with 11260 mty capacity in its various subsidiaries to
reduce the ash from coal so as to make it competitive in comparison to imported coal according to

tree plantation on reclaimed land in back filled  ob dump areas plantation in  around mines road
sides township  residential areas available vacant spaces and implementation of conservation plan
for protection of flora  fauna are carried out as per environmental clearance ec
this is apart from the payment made for compensatory afforestation for diverted forest for mining in
double the degraded forest as marked by the state forest departments the plantation has created man
made forest in mining areas where there was minimum forest even in the marked and designated
forest areas the tree density was much less earlier than the forest we have created

since beginning the subsidiaries of cil have under taken up massive plantation work through
concerned state forest corporations till 31st march2015cil has planted around 8267 million trees
over an area of around 34944 ha
keeping biodiversity in mind we
plant mostly indigenous plants to
preserve the biodiversity
we go for multispecies plantation
with a proper mix of timber yielding
fruit bearing medicinal and ther
useful varieties

the detail of plantation carried out
in the last three years by the
different subsidiaries is given in

regular air water and noise monitoring
all the mines  washeries of cil are being monitored on regular basis by cmpdi in case of any
deficiency the sources are identified and immediate corrective measures are taken by the areas 
projects for amelioration

other measures to reduce pollution at the source by new methods
switching to ecofriendly mode of transport
in order to reduce the dust pollution due to road transportation ecofriendly measures are being
adopted coal to thermal power stations who consume more than 80 of thermal coal is transported
by rail  series of belt conveyors to thermal power stations  rail heads are constructed to make rail
head available nearer to mine to reduce road transportation we have constructed and are constructing
integrated chp for rapid loading wagon and trucks in future both existing and future mines will have
mode of coal transportation more and more either by rail or conveyors

clean mining technology
more and more surface miners and continuous miners are being deployed for reduction of air
pollution high wall mining has been introduced to recover thin coal seams after economical open
cast mining is over in underground mines manual mining are being converted to semimechanized
bord  pillar mining with lhd load haul dumper  sdl side discharge loader and fully
mechanized mass production technology with continuous miner cm and power support longwall
pslw faces in phases udms universal drilling machines are being deployed this not only
reduces wastage of valuable coal but also increase productivity as well as safety of the workers in the
mines manriding system is being installed to fully utilize shift hours to increase productivity and
ensuring safety of the personnel

conservation of natural resources

indirect primary energy consumption
electricity is the major source of energy in the mining operations electricity consumed in different
coal producing subsidiaries is given in table under en4

cil has taken following initiatives to reduce electricity consumption and improve efficiency

 i    street lights in residential area as well as non  residential area are being connected to auto
       timer based off  on system
 ii   high energy consuming mercury  sodium vapour lamps are replaced with led  cfl or any
       other energy efficient lamps
iii   possibilities for installation of low voltage lv distribution line with insulated wire to prevent
       hooking and power pilferage
iv    overhead water tanks of the residential buildings rb and nonresidential buildings nrb
       are fitted with float valves
 v    to use the roof top of rb  nrb including hospital  dispensary and canteen etc for
       generating electricity with the help of photo voltaic cells or any other conversion method to
       utilize solar energy
vi    initiatives have improved power factor of 47 metering points to more than 097 from 080

 the impact of water drawl are limited to only 300m depending on the strata condition from the
   active mining operation zone and only for the period of mine life this 300 m zone around
   specifically for open cast mine is physically acquired for the mine as blasting safety zone
   however if there is any report of shortage of water the affected habitation are provided with
   suitable drinking water supply by sinking hand pumps through water tankers piped water etc
 the entire mines industrial water demand is mostly met from the mine water the treated mine
   water is also used for domestic and agricultural need
 the surplus treated mine water is discharge into the local ponds agricultural fields and finally to
   the natural courses
 after cessation of mining a part of the open cast mine area is reclaimed and the final void is
   converted into a water reservoir which in turn works as water recharge structure and source of
   water for the local similarly under ground mine after exhaustion also serves as water recharging
   structure
water balance study of emp approved by moef may be refereed to justify the above phenomena
as such there is no water scarce area however if any specific space under the cil command area 
nearby villages are affected cil  subsidiary companies take every steps to prevent the water
shortage as a part of csr activities
