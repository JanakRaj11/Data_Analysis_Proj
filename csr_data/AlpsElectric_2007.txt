ensure that top priority is placed on quality during manufacturing
processes
the aim of the ippatsukando initiative is to manufacture
products of consistent quality ﬁrst time in the past all areas from                                      value

development through to manufacturing departments followed a
process where a prototype was made to required specifications
tested inspected and then modified where needed however
we would sometimes receive complaints from customers even
with products that had been manufactured to the required
speciﬁcations
                                                                                                           monozukuri
under the ippatsukando initiative quality is assumed to be the
result of correct functionality rather than just from meeting                                    alps electrics reason for being is to make new
particular specifications the criterion is market opinion or                                    proposals based on unique and original concepts plans
customer feedback based on the quality function deployment                                      and ideas that meet customer requirements this also
qfd method we carefully study what functions are valued by                                    leads to providing customers with attractive products
the market and customers and then propose potential new value                                   that exceed their expectations
that would be unique to our product this proposal is translated
into a technical theme at the development phase and used when                                    we evaluate customer needs and potential in our
designing the product as well as in quality control and product                                 endeavor to create new value at the same time we

 reducing waste
 alps electric implemented a zeroemissions a initiative and successfully
 achieved its goal of recycling all waste by the end of ﬁscal 2004 this initiative
 covers all waste including ordinary waste from offices and canteens but
 excludes products containing material for resale

 15 of ﬁscal 2004 levels in ﬁscal 2006 however the discharge of waste per
 unit of output increased due to a ﬂuctuation in total production value we
 also target a reduction in quantity of paper used in fiscal 2008 by 20 of
