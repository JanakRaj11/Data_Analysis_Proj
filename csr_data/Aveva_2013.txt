our target markets


avevas products are most applicable in industries where scale and complexity are greatest
as a result in recent years the principal driver of growth has been the oil  gas industry
aveva also has a strong market position in the global power market the marine industry is also
traditionally a key area of strength although the industry is currently in a cyclical downturn
offset partially by offshore projects aveva also sells into related industries shown below

in marine the industry is in the midst of a cyclical downturn                     of years of development and incorporates much of the functionality

particularly in china where the shipyards have been more focused                   designed to be fully compatible with our existing 3d applications

an increasing amount of the shipyards work is now related                         to customers seeking to maintain competitive advantage

consolidated income statement presents adjusted profit before tax and reconciles this to profit before tax as required to be presented
under the applicable accounting standards adjusted earnings per share as disclosed in note 14 is calculated having adjusted profit after
tax for the same items and their tax effect the term adjusted profit is not defined under ifrs and may not be comparable with similarly
titled profit measures reported by other companies it is not intended to be a substitute for or superior to gaap measures of profit

a statement of compliance
the consolidated financial statements of aveva group plc and all its subsidiaries the group have been prepared in accordance
with international financial reporting standards ifrss as adopted by the european union as they apply to the financial statements
of the group for the year ended 31 march 2013 the groups financial statements are also consistent with ifrss as issued by the iasb
the parent company financial statements of aveva group plc have been prepared in accordance with uk generally accepted
accounting practice uk gaap and are included on pages 89 to 92

b basis of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of aveva group plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 march each year
the financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using existing gaap for each country of operation adjustments are made to
translate any differences that may exist between the respective local gaap and ifrss
intercompany balances and transactions including unrealised profits arising from intragroup transactions have been eliminated in full
subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the group and cease to be consolidated from the date
on which control is transferred out of the group
on acquisition assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition with any excess of the cost
of acquisition over this value being capitalised as goodwill

c adoption of new and revised standards
the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year new standards and interpretations which
came into force during the year did not have a significant impact on the groups financial statements

new standards and interpretations not yet effective
during the year the iasb and ifric have issued the following standards although in some cases not yet adopted by the eu which are
expected to have implications for the reporting of the financial position or performance of the group or which will require additional
disclosures in future financial years
                                                                                                                                     effective for periods

the group intends to adopt these standards in the first accounting period after the effective date the adoption of ias19 revised
in 201314 is expected to reduce the element of finance revenue associated with retirement benefit obligations by approximately

on the consolidated financial statements in the period of initial application

continued


3 significant accounting estimates
the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of judgement and estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial
year are discussed below

a retirement benefit obligations
the determination of the groups obligations and expense for defined benefit pensions is dependent on the selection by the board
of directors of assumptions used by the pension scheme actuary in calculating these amounts the assumptions applied together with
sensitivity analysis are described in note 28 and include amongst others the discount rate the inflation rate rates of increase in salaries
and mortality rates while the directors consider that the assumptions are appropriate significant differences in the actual experience
or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the reported amount of the groups future pension obligations actuarial
gains and losses included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in future years and the future staff costs the carrying
amount of retirement benefit obligations at 31 march 2013 was 16959000 2012  9875000

b provision for impairment of receivables
the group makes provision for the impairment of receivables on a customer specific basis the determination of the appropriate level
of provision involves an estimate of the potential risk of default or nonpayment by the groups customers and management consider
a number of factors including the financial strength of the customers the level of default that the group has suffered in the past the age
of the receivable outstanding and the groups trading experience with that customer the provision for impairment of receivables
at 31 march 2013 was 4771000 2012  3431000

c revenue recognition
revenue from sales of software licences when these are combined with the delivery of significant implementation or customisation
services is recognised in line with the delivery of the services to the customer this policy involves the assessment of which customer
projects include significant customisation or implementation and also an assessment of the stage of completion of such projects
we generally only enter into this type of contract in our enterprise solutions segment but the assessments and estimates used
by the group could have a significant impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognised on a project

4 summary of significant accounting policies
a revenue
the group generates its revenue principally from licensing the rights to use its software products directly to end users and to a lesser
extent indirectly through resellers revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents the
amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts and sales taxes it comprises
initial licence fees annual fees and rental licence fees together with income from consultancy and other related services
for each revenue stream revenue is not recognised unless and until
bb a clear contractual arrangement can be evidenced
bb delivery has been made in accordance with that contract
bb if required contractual acceptance criteria have been met and
bb the fee has been agreed and collectability is probable where extended payment terms beyond 180 days exist revenue recognition
   is deferred until payment is due

initialannual licence agreements
users are charged an initial licence fee upon installation for a set number of users together with an obligatory annual fee which is charged
every year annual fees consist of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance which includes core product upgrades
and enhancements and remote support services users must continue to pay annual fees in order to maintain the right to use the software
initial licence fees are recognised once the above conditions have been met annual fees are recognised on a straightline basis over
the period of the contract which is typically twelve months if annual fees are charged at a discount an amount is allocated out of
the initial licence fee at fair market value based on the value established when annual fees are charged separately to customers

rental licence agreements
as an alternative to the initial licence fee plus annual fee model the group also supplies its software under three different types
of rental licence agreement
rental licence fees which are invoiced monthly and which are cancellable by the customer are recognised on a monthly basis
other rental licence agreements are invoiced at the start of the contracted period which is typically one year are noncancellable and consist
of two separate components the initial software delivery and the continuing right to use with customer support and maintenance revenue
in respect of the continuing right to use and customer support and maintenance element is valued at fair market value based on the value
established when annual fees are charged separately to the customer this component is recognised on a straightline basis over the period
of the contract the residual amount representing the implied initial fee element is recognised upfront provided all of the above criteria
have been met where uncertainty exists and it is not possible to reliably determine the fair value of the customer support and maintenance
element all revenue is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the contract

4 summary of significant accounting policies continued
a revenue continued
rental licence agreements continued
the group also licenses its software using a token licensing model under this model a basket of tokens representing licences to use
different software products over a defined period is granted which enables the customer to draw these down as and when required
where the customer commits in advance to a specified number of tokens over a defined period a proportion of revenue is recognised
with an appropriate element deferred for customer support and maintenance obligations subject to the above recognition conditions
being met where the customer is charged in arrears revenue is recognised based on actual number of tokens used

services
services consist primarily of consultancy implementation services and training and are performed under separate service arrangements
revenue from these services is recognised as the services are performed and stage of completion is determined by reference to the
costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the service project if a contract cannot be reliably estimated revenue
is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen
if an arrangement includes both licence and service elements licence fee revenue is recognised upon delivery of the software provided
that services do not include significant customisation or modification of the base product and the payment terms for licences are not subject
to acceptance criteria in all other cases revenues from both licence and service elements are recognised as services are performed

b foreign currencies
the functional and presentational currency of aveva group plc is pounds sterling  transactions in foreign currencies are initially
recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date all differences are taken to
the consolidated income statement
nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date
of the initial transaction
the subsidiaries have a number of different functional currencies as at the reporting date the assets and liabilities of these overseas
subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling  at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements
are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year exchange differences arising on the retranslation are taken directly
to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income

c exceptional items
the group discloses items of both income and expense which are exceptional by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better
understanding of the underlying trading performance of the group the group includes the costs of significant restructuring exercises
fees associated with business combinations and costs incurred in integrating acquired companies

d goodwill
goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest
in the net fair value of the identifiable assets liabilities and contingent liabilities following initial recognition goodwill is measured at cost
less any accumulated impairment losses
where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of the goodwill associated with
the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation
goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion
of the cashgenerating unit retained
if the potential benefit of tax losses or other deferred tax assets does not satisfy the criteria in ifrs 3 for separate recognition when
a business combination is initially accounted for but is subsequently realised the group recognises the deferred tax income in the
consolidated income statement

e intangible assets
intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalised at fair value as at the date
of acquisition following initial recognition the cost model is applied to each class of intangible asset as set out below
expenditure on internally developed intangible assets excluding development costs is taken to the consolidated income statement
in the year in which it is incurred internal software development expenditure is recognised as an intangible asset only after its technical
feasibility and commercial viability can be demonstrated
useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments where applicable are made on a prospective basis amortisation
is calculated on a straightline basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the asset which are as follows
                                                                                                                                                     years

h impairment of assets
goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to cashgenerating units expected to benefit from the combinations synergies and represents
the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and generates cash flows which are independent
of other cashgenerating units the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested
for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired the carrying values of property
plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstance
indicate the carrying value may be impaired if any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable
amount the assets or cashgenerating units are written down to their recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the greater of
net selling price and value in use in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value
using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset
for an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows the recoverable amount is determined for the cashgenerating
unit to which the asset belongs impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative expenses line item

i trade and other receivables
trade receivables which generally have 30 to 90 day terms are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for
any uncollectible amounts an estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable bad debts
are written off when identified

j cash and cash equivalents
cash and shortterm deposits in the consolidated balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and shortterm deposits with an original
maturity of three months or less the carrying amount of these approximates their fair value for the purpose of the consolidated cash
flow statement cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts

k derivative financial instruments
the only derivative financial instruments the group holds are forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce exposure to foreign
exchange risk the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes all forward foreign
exchange contracts have been markedtomarket and are held at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet the group has not
applied hedge accounting during the year and therefore movements in fair value are being recorded in the consolidated income
statement fair value is estimated using the settlement rates prevailing at the period end

l leases
leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases operating
lease payments are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement on a straightline basis over the lease term

m taxation
deferred income tax is provided using the liability method on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes
deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences
bb except where the deferred income tax liability arises from goodwill amortisation or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
   a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable
   profit or loss and

n post retirement benefits
the group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the uk sweden and germany the group also provides certain post
employment benefits to its south korean employees
the uk defined benefit pension scheme previously available to all uk employees was closed to new applicants in 2002 uk employees
are now offered membership of a defined contribution scheme
the german unfunded defined benefit schemes are closed to new applicants and provide benefits to nine deferred members
these schemes were acquired as part of previous business combinations no current employees participate in the scheme
full provision has been made for the liability on the consolidated balance sheet the group also operates a defined benefit pension
scheme for one german employee
the group provides pension arrangements to its swedish employees through an industrywide defined benefit scheme it is not possible
to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme which is attributable to the group on a fair and reasonable
basis therefore the group has applied the provisions in ias 19 to account for the scheme as if it was a defined contribution scheme
for the defined benefit schemes the defined benefit obligation is calculated annually for each plan by qualified external actuaries
using the projected unit credit method which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost
and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligation the retirement benefit liability in the
consolidated balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate derived from a published
index of aa rated corporate bonds as reduced by the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly
fair value is based on market price information and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price the value of a net pension
benefit asset is restricted to the present value of any amount the group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions
in the future contributions the current service cost is recognised in the consolidated income statement as an employee benefit expense
the interest element of the defined benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage
of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation taking into account
material changes in the obligation during the year the expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning
of the year of longterm market returns on scheme assets adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received
and benefits paid during the year the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the consolidated income
statement as finance revenue and finance expense respectively
actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments or changes in actuarial assumptions are credited or charged in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise
the group also operates defined contribution pension schemes for a number of uk and nonuk employees contributions to defined
contribution plans are charged to profit before tax as they become payable

o sharebased payments
the cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted
further details of which are given in note 29 in valuing equitysettled transactions no account is taken of any performance conditions
other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of aveva group plc market conditions
the cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised together with a corresponding increase in equity over the period in which the
performance conditions are fulfilled ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting
date the cumulative expense recognised for equitysettled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent
to which the vesting period has expired and the groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest
no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market
condition which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied provided that all other
performance conditions are satisfied
where the terms of an equitysettled award are modified as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been
modified in addition an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification
as measured at the date of modification

at the balance sheet date the uk government had substantively enacted a 1 reduction in the main rate of uk corporation tax from 24
to 23 effective from 1 april 2013 the government has also proposed reducing the uk corporation tax rate to 21 by 1 april 2014 and
20 by 1 april 2015 however these further rate changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and their effects
are not therefore included in these financial statements we do not expect that the enactment of these changes will have a material
impact on the deferred tax balance of the group

16 goodwill continued
considering the sensitivity levels for the two cashgenerating units

engineering  design systems
during 201213 the contribution of the engineering  design systems cgu was 1441 million this is far in excess of the attributable
goodwill value therefore the directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment
of goodwill such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value

enterprise solutions
the recoverable amount of the enterprise solutions cgu is determined from a value in use calculation the key assumptions for this
calculation are those regarding discount rates and growth rates management estimates discount rates using pretax rates that reflect
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cgu
the group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending
31 march 2014 together with the most recent three year business plan and extrapolates cash flows for future years based on an average
estimated new business growth rate of 4 2012  4 in addition revenue is also forecast to grow from the impact of sales of initial
licenses driving increased annual fees in future periods in total the revenue growth in periods beyond the period covered by the business
plan is 7 the longterm average growth rate is based on typical growth rates for companies with strong software and technology
services that are exposed to high growth sectors such as oil  gas and power and high growth economies such as asia pacific
india and latin america
future cash flows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 12 pretax 2012  12
headroom for goodwill based on current forecasts is 32 million sensitivity levels on these calculations indicate that impairment
would need to be considered if
bb instead of 12 a discount rate of 185 or higher had been used or
bb instead of 4 a longterm new business growth rate of 1 or lower had been used

contracts the group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly
from its operations
the group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the groups operations
it is and has been throughout the period under review the groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall
be undertaken
the main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are market risk credit risk and liquidity risk the board reviews and agrees
policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below

a market risk
market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the groups income or
the value of its holding of financial instruments the objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures
within acceptable parameters

interest rate risk
the group holds net funds and hence its interest rate risk is associated with shortterm cash deposits and treasury deposits the groups
overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between security of funds accessibility and competitive
rates of return

for the presentation of market risks ifrs 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk
variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity the group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents
and treasury deposits the group does not have any borrowings the impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the
cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances
a 1 point decrease in the sterling and us dollar interest rates would have reduced interest income by approximately 1148000
2012  1302000 and profit after tax by 872000 2012  963000

foreign currency risk
foreign currency risk arises from the group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations
these exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the groups functional currency of sterling the majority of
costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit the main exposures relate to the us dollar euro and yen reflecting
the fact that a significant proportion of the groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion
of its costs such as research and development are settled in sterling and swedish krona
the group manages these exchange risks where possible by using currency exchange contracts for the sale of us dollar euro and
yen as appropriate the group enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts
when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain in addition the group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to
sell us dollars and euro to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base these are renewed on a revolving basis
as required at 31 march 2013 the group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell 210 million 2012  130 million
1425 million 2012  665 million and 3040 million 2012  nil it has also had outstanding currency exchange contracts to buy
kr240 million 2012  kr nil
the group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange
contracts have been included in the consolidated income statement
the group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk gains and losses arising
from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income

foreign currency sensitivity analysis
for the presentation of market risks ifrs 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes in the foreign
exchange rates in profit or loss or shareholders equity the impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate

b credit risk
the groups principal financial assets are cash equivalents treasury deposits trade and other receivables
counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy which has been approved by
the board and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies the amount
of exposure to each counterparty is subject to a specific limit up to a maximum of 70 million as set out in the groups treasury policy
the group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business
the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables an allowance for impairment
is made where there is an identified loss event which based on previous experience is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of
the cash flows the group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis credit checks are performed
before credit is granted to new customers the group has no significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread over a large
number of customers the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset the exposure
to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance
the group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets
disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 20

c liquidity risk
the group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows
and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities the group has no borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk
is not considered a significant risk at this time
the table below analyses the groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based
on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual

the three levels are defined as follows
bb level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
bb level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable
   for the asset or liability either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices and
bb level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not
   based on observable market data unobservable inputs
at 31 march 2013 the group had forward foreign exchange contracts which were measured at level 2 fair value subsequent to initial
recognition the fair value of the liability in respect of foreign exchange contracts was 574000 at 31 march 2013 2012  223000 asset

at the balance sheet date the group has unused tax losses of 4109000 2012  795000 available for offset against future profits
of the total deferred tax asset of 1237000 2012  238000 1051000 2012  238000 has been recognised and is included
in other above these losses may be carried forward indefinitely
at the balance sheet date the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries
for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 42612000 2012  32172000 no liability has been
recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences
and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future it is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings
would qualify for the uk dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes

was closed to new employees on 30 september 2002 with the option of reopening if required and was converted to a career average
revalued earnings basis on 30 september 2004 pensions are payable to dependants on death in retirement and a lump sum is payable
if death occurs in service there is an insurance policy in place which covers this liability administration on behalf of the members is
governed by a trust deed and the funds are held and managed by professional investment managers who are independent of the group

management limited at rates which are calculated to be sufficient to meet the future liabilities of the scheme using the projected unit
credit method the employees contributions are fixed as a percentage of salary the balance being made up by the employer scheme assets
are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates
to develop the expected longterm rate of return on assets assumption the company considered the current level of expected returns
on riskfree investments primarily government bonds the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes
