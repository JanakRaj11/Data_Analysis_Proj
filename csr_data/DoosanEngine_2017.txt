                           since the shipbuilding contracts aggregated domestic and international shipping industries have faced the worst economic
                           condition and restructured in the entire scale despite the continuous tough management situation doosan engine has
                           strengthened the foundation for sustainable management and made versatile efforts to gain financial competitive edge over the
                           last year thereby achieving a turnaround by reaching a breakeven point

                           difficulties in shipping industry are expected to continue this year as well we anticipate that global economy will be more
                           uncertain and the level of market competition for securing contracts inevitable for existence will be much more fierce
                           nevertheless we will enhance the profitability of lowspeed engine business and fortify the effort to secure contracts and activate
                           scr business by upgrading the competitive edge of our merchandise so that we can overcome the current depression and

                           expand our after market business based on the demand for engine parts and for charged service to generate new profits

                           besides we wont be negligent in social responsibility management initiatives for the sustainable and sound growth of doosan

                           our workplace and the establishment of csr management system in the supply chain
