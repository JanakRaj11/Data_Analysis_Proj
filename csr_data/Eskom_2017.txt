1 calculated figures based on coal characteristics and power station design parameters based on coal analysis and using coal burnt tonnages
   figures include coalfired and gas turbine power stations as well as oil consumed during power station startups and for carbon dioxide emissions
   includes the underground coal gasification pilot plant
2 no x reported as no2 is calculated using average stationspecific emission factors which are measured intermittently and tonnages of coal burnt
3 volume of water consumed per unit of generated power sent out by commissioned power stations
4 the limit set by the national nuclear regulator is 025msv
5 the gross mass of a nuclear fuel element is approximately 670kg with uo2 mass typically between 462kg and 464kg
6 reported in terms of the 2002 definition of the operational health dashboard from 2008 repeat legal contraventions are included
