consumption and the energy consumptions of access             dpt another key technology of zte can realize breath
networks of fixed operators is reaching almost 50 from       like power management it can manage the power suppliers
this we can see that wireless base station cable access      in an intelligent way by tracking load changes and supplying
network power supply and new energy will be the focuses       hierarchical variable voltages that means if the power
