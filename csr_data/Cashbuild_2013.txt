challenges faced and lessons learned

social unrest and the south african context
during the period challenges in the form of social unrest in the rural environments in which we trade in south
africa such as the marikana incident and the protest actions related to service delivery zamdela incident had
a negative impact and resulted in losses of r23 million over the period between january 2013 and july 2013 with
our stores being unable to trade for 139 days while insurance covered financial losses to property and product
range the effects of these incidents were not simply shortterm and financial it became apparent through these inci
dents that our trading may be severely impacted by the geopolitical and socioeconomic environments and cannot
be separated from them

the sustainability of the numerous social investment channels into cashbuilds trading communities have to date
generally provided returns brand loyalty and community inclusiveness were highlighted as a focus area
we found for example that building materials donated were not always effectively utilised for a variety of
reasons these incidents provided us with the opportunity to learn and to respond proactively to potential risk
areas as well as to investigate the effectiveness of our model for investment and csi spend ensuring that the
necessary support provided was actually what was required this has resulted in us exploring initiatives for continuity
to get commitment and ownership by partnering and involving schools community leaders ward councillors
government department circuit managers and the store employees themselves whom we expect to act as
mitigators and tacit insurance in the event of future unrest we believe strongly that our strategically implemented
structure and decentralised model with its potential to yield further value through vitally important and enduring
local relationships  supported by the strong backbone of the cashbuild support office  differentiates us from our
competitors we intend however to place attention in these areas to ensure our csi spend will succeed further in
building strategically important relationships as originally intended

we recently grouped all our csi activities under one umbrella and have also branded it as such

strategic business sustainability

sustainability is often defined as the utilisation of current resources without detriment to future generations
it is not only about our impact on the environment but also how environmental concerns may affect our ability
to sustain ourselves and those dependent on our success all these interdependencies play a role in our efforts
to grow our business into the future we realise that the macrosocioeconomic and geopolitical climate may
ultimately support or hinder our efforts for success and in response we proactively and consistently monitor these
indicators as part of our strategic decisionmaking through our operational and board committees specifically with
regard to risk  see risk management process in our corporate governance report on page 59

by following the precautionary approach we acknowledge that careful consideration with proper feasibility
and impact studies including current cause and future effect be taken into account before we embark on any
sustainability initiatives our experience to embark on and learn from pilot projects before we implement changes
has stood us in good stead in all areas of our business in the complex southern african context in which we operate
we have learned many valuable lessons over our 35 year history specifically in terms of multicultural sensitivities
differing priorities and the absolute necessity to build lasting open relationships with stakeholders we have
consistently found that our decentralised model and local recruitment policy which empowers local managers
with greatest understanding of the nuances of the local community as one of the greatest assets as well as
potential risk mitigation in successfully bringing cashbuild to new and often challenging environments

a number of cashbuilds suppliers have been supplying us for more than 30 years the main ingredient for the
mutually beneficial partnership is to ensure that cashbuild delivers a quality product at the right time at a
competitive price a lot of time is invested by cashbuild to ensure that we have mutually beneficial relationships
with our suppliers when the economy is under pressure we work with our suppliers to ensure that we remain
competitive and grow market share as much as the market allows we will only engage with suppliers if the
relationship is mutually beneficial we will ensure that we get the best possible purchase price and retail
the product at a competitive price this in turn ensures that we can procure the necessary volumes from
our suppliers to make the relationship profitable for them as well

contractor funding
to ensure enhanced future profits of our new stores cashbuild has continued with the initiative whereby we
team up with our store developers and replace their funding from banks with our own cash resources in essence
its a prepayment of the rental for the term allowing the landlord to offer a reduced rental and escalation throughout
the rental term this will ensure improved profitability of our stores into the future limited opportunities of this
nature arise and in the past year we have concluded another two of these transactions bringing to date five successful
contracts of this nature we will continue to offer this to all new store developers

although retail organisations have less impact on the environment when compared with their direct manufacturing or
processing counterparts cashbuild recognises the need to minimise its carbon footprint and encourage its industry
partners to do the same

project to reduce electricity usage energy saving lighting
cashbuild implemented a new project to reduce electricity consumption and cost of our stores and support office
by replacing existing incandescent lightbulbs with energy efficient energy saving lights the pilot project was carried
out successfully at our support office and rolled out to 12 of our stores cashbuild has initially focused this project on
stores which have a monthly electricity cost over r8 000the expected electricity saving based on preliminary figures
from this project is a decrease in excess of 50 in energy cost at stores where the project has been implemented
subsequent to yearend we have converted another five stores and plan to convert a further six stores during the
up coming period we have upgraded the specifications on our new stores and as and when we do refurbishments
to use energy efficient lighting

it is acknowledged by cashbuild that king iii represents a significant milestone in the evolution of corporate            governance report
governance in south africa and brings with it opportunities for organisations that embrace its principles where
appropriate in line with the apply or explain governance framework principle contained in king iii the cashbuild
board acknowledges that where it considers it to be in the best interests of the company it can adopt a practice
different from that recommended in king iii but must explain it cashbuild therefore carefully assessed the principles
of the code and where necessary tailored it as appropriate to the organisation

based on the outcome of an independent corporate governance compliance review facilitated by pwc during
september 2011 cashbuild committed to action plans for the improvement of the status at that time and recorded
these in a three year roadmap successful completion of activities contained in this roadmap are
   ethical leadership and corporate citizenship

   boards and directors
		  terms of reference of board and board committees reviewed and updated and
		  consideration given to annual board and board committee evaluations

         satisfying the need for greater group oversight and a consolidated view through combined assurance
		        assessment of the various aspects of compliance and
         considering various assurance options for material key performance indicators

in its continued quest to improve its approach to corporate governance cashbuild subscribed to the institute of
directors southern africas governance assessment instrument  gai  refer to httpwwwiodsagaicoza
cashbuild made this decision in the knowledge that by applying the gai the stakeholders of the company will gain
assurance that the principles of good governance as laid out in king iii have been applied as evidenced by the process
of a complete and credible standardised review of all the supportive practices a further consideration prompting
this decision was the fact that the iodsa gai also encompasses the jse listings requirements and the south african
companies act 2008 as these pertain to corporate governance

it governance

cashbuild it project
cashbuilds it project consisting of the implementation of an integrated active retail and sap allinone solution
was successfully completed towards the end of may 2013 with the exception of deployment of active retail in the
malawi store roll out of active retail to cashbuild stores being a primary focus during the 2013 financial year was
achieved within a timeframe of 14 months by a dedicated and focused team of specialists supported by cashbuild
management and staff

project governance was tightly controlled by the project team and supported by weekly updates provided to the
executive management team weekly project management sessions involving members of cashbuild operations
finance and an external service provider monthly project risk management workshops attended by representatives
of all stakeholders in the project and monthly it governance meetings it should be noted that it governance
meetings commenced as project specific sessions but are progressing towards a companywide it governance
forum as a natural progressive evolution of the original it project committee to a cashbuild board subcommittee

the decision made not to roll out active retail to the malawi store is the result of unique business requirements
associated with business in this country not catered for in the vanilla active retail application alternative solutions
are being explored with the required controls currently in place for continued support of the legacy application
utilised in this store

in order to create further efficiencies in the business several additional processes and activities have been identified
since commencement of the project and these improvements to the sap and active retail systems are ongoing
business imperative items receiving continued and focused attention are those relating to daily balancing of
transactional data between active retail and sap

   the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out            statements

   below these policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated

   11   basis of preparation

   standards ifrs and the companies act 2008 of south africa these consolidated financial statements have been
   prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities

   it also requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the groups accounting policies

   the accounting policies are consistent with those used in the annual financial statements for the financial period
   ended june 2013

  a     amendments to published standards effective in 2013
		       there are no amendments to published standards effective in 2013 that are relevant to the group

  b     standards early adopted by the group
		       the group has not chosen to early adopt any standards

         1 july 2012
		       the iasb has issued an amendment to ias 1 presentation of financial statements the main change resulting
         from these amendments is a requirement for entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income
         oci on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently reclassification
         adjustments the amendments do not address which items are presented in oci

		       amendment to ias 12income taxes on deferred tax effective 1 january 2012
		       currently ias 12 income taxes requires an entity to measure the deferred tax relating to an asset depending
         on whether the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of the asset through use or sale it can
         be difficult and subjective to assess whether recovery will be through use or through sale when the asset
         is measured using the fair value model in ias 40 investment property hence this amendment introduces
         an exception to the existing principle for the measurement of deferred tax assets or liabilities arising on
         investment property measured at fair value as a result of the amendments sic 21 income taxes recovery
         of revalued nondepreciable assets would no longer apply to investment properties carried at fair value the
         amendments also incorporate into ias 12 the remaining guidance previously contained in sic 21 which is
         accordingly withdrawn

   d    standards amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective
         and have not been early adopted by the group
		       the following standards amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are

		       the iasb has published an amendment to ifrs 7 financial instruments disclosures reflecting the joint
         requirements with the fasb to enhance current offsetting disclosures these new disclosures are intended
         to facilitate comparison between those entities that prepare ifrs financial statements to those that prepare

           financial statements are presented in rands which is the groups functional currency and the presentation
           currency of the parent

  b       transactions and balances
		         foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing
           at the dates of the transactions foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
           transactions are recognised in the income statement

		         foreign currency balances are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the
           financial position date foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the revaluation of these balances are
           recognised in the income statement and this applies to both monetary and nonmonetary balances

  c       group companies
		         the results of and financial positions of all the group entities none of which have the currency of a hyperinflation
           economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the
           presentation currency as follows
		              assets and liabilities for each financial position presented are translated at the closing rates at the date
                 of that financial position
		              income and expenses for each income statement are translated at the average exchange rates unless
                 this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the
                 transaction dates in which case income and expenses are translated at the date of the transactions and
		              all resulting exchange differences are recognised through other comprehensive income

		         on consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities
           are taken to shareholders equity if a foreign entity were to be sold such exchange differences would be
           recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale

		         if goodwill and fair value adjustments were to arise on the acquisition of foreign entities they would be treated
           as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at closing rates exchange differences arising are
           recognised in other comprehensive income

criteria to capitalise development cost related to computer software include
		                  it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use
		                  management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it
		                  there is an ability to use or sell the software product
		                  it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits
		                  adequate technical financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
                     software product are available and
		                  the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured

		          these assets are amortised over their expected useful lives five years costs that are directly associated
            with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the group and that will
            probably generate economic benefits exceeding the costs beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets
            maintenance costs that do not meet the capitalisation criteria will be expensed

      18   impairment of nonfinancial assets

      assets that have an indefinite useful life  for example goodwill or intangible assets not ready to use  are not subject
      to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment

      assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
      circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognised for the
      amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher
      of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use for the purpose of assessing impairment assets are grouped
      at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cashgenerating units

      19   current and deferred income tax

      income tax expense represents the sum of the current taxes charge and deferred tax the charge for current tax
      is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are nonassessable or disallowed deferred taxation
      is provided in full using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and
      liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements however deferred tax is not accounted
      for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination
      that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred income tax is
      determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the financial position date
      and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability
      is settled

      deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available
      against which the temporary differences can be utilised

      deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the
      timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary
      difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future

      deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax
      assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and liabilities relate to income taxes
      levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is
      an intention to settle the balances on a net basis

      110 inventories

      inventories comprise merchandise held for resale and are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value cost
      is calculated using the weighted average cost method cost includes the purchase price related transport charges
      and import duties and taxes net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less
      applicable variable selling expenses

		capital risk management
      the groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern
      in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital
      structure to reduce the cost of capital

      in order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders
      return capital to shareholders issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt

  due to the cash generative nature of the groups operations and current prevailing economic conditions management
  has determined that the lowest possible gearing ratio will provide shareholders with the highest possible return on
  investment with the lowest possible exposure to financial risk the gearing ratio is calculated as net debt borrowings
  divided by equity and was 023 2012 025 on the statement of financial position date
		
  the groups target is to maintain a dividend cover of 2 times final results

3		critical accounting estimates and judgements
      the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with ifrs requires the use of certain critical accounting
      estimates it requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the groups accounting
      policies the areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates
      are significant to the financial statements are mainly the impairment of tangible and intangible assets the estimation
      of useful lives of property plant and equipment and intangible assets and establishing uniform depreciation and
      amortisation methods the likelihood that deferred and income taxes can be realised and the probability of doubtful
      debts the key estimates and assumptions relating to these areas are disclosed in the relevant notes to the financial
      statements

      all estimates and underlying assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that
      management believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of these estimates form the basis of
      judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual
      results may differ from these estimates the estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis
      revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and any affected
      future periods
      the estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
      of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below

  a        inventory
		          impairment allowances are raised against inventory when it is considered that the amount realisable from
            such inventorys sale is considered to be less than its carrying amount the impairment allowance is made with
            reference to an inventory age analysis

  b        income taxes
		          the group is subject to income tax in several jurisdictions significant judgement is required in determining the
            worldwide provision for income taxesthere are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax
            determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business where the final tax outcome is different
            from the amounts that were initially recorded such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax
            provisions in the period in which such determination is made

		          management has to exercise judgement with regards to deferred tax assets where the possibility exists that
            no future taxable income may flow against which these assets can be offset the deferred tax assets are not
            recognised

  c        fair value of sharebased payments
		          the fair value of options granted are being determined using either a binominal blackscholes or a monte
            carlo valuation model the significant inputs into the model are vesting period riskfree interest rate volatility
            price on date of grant and dividend yield

  d        useful life of assets
		          in determining the depreciation and amortisation charge for property plant and equipment and intangible
            assets management applies judgment in estimating the useful lives and residual values of these different asset
            classes
