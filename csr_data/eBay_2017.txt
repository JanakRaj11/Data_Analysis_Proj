                             notes on
                             our goals
                             goals have a baseline of 2016

                             circular economy
                                for this estimate ebay metrics of the number of preowned items sold between
                                 individuals in 2016 and the usd value of these items were collected for electronics
                                 and fashion categories for north america and the uk markets

                                we assumed that buying a preowned item from ebay avoids the need for an
                                 equivalent new item to be produced this new item is avoided and all of the
                                 environmental impacts associated with making it are also avoided

                                to account for differences in quality and lifetime between new and preowned items
                                 an adjustment factor was used this was estimated to be approximately 40 percent
                                 or 25 preowned products are needed to displace 1 new product

                                published environmental impact data were collected for the production of new
                                 items matching ebay product categories as closely as possible

                                environmental impact data per item were then multiplied by the number of sold items
                                 to calculate the amount avoided impact for each listing category and overall for
                                 electronics and fashion in 2016 these results were then projected for the years out
                                 to 2020 using forecasted growth in those markets

                                the financial savings to the customer of buying preowned rather than new products
                                 were also estimated using a similar approach
