                     cytecs shift to hybrid vehicles in the uk
                theyre growing in popularity across the world and offer environmental benefits that are difficult
                to deny from the toyota prius to the ford fusion hybrid general consumers and companies are
                increasingly adopting hybrid vehicles recognizing their benefits cytec leases both conventional
                hybrid and plugin hybrid vehicles powered by both gasoline and diesel fuel for three uk sites
                today nearly onethird of the companyoperated cars and vans in the uk are either hybrid or
                plugin hybrid vehicles
                traditional hybrid vehicles are powered by a combination of an electric motor and a gasoline
                powered engine the engine serves a dual purpose in addition to powering the vehicle it also
                recharges the electric motor hybrids use less fuel and emit less carbon dioxide co2 than most
                conventional nonhybrid vehicles cytecs hybrid cars produce 27 less co2 than their traditionally
                fueled counterparts
                cytec also leases plugin hybrid vehicles which are dependent on highcapacity batteries that
                are charged using standard electrical outlets or charging stations they store a significant amount
                of electricity from the power grid which in turn results in a reduction in fuel consumption under
                typical driving conditions compared to traditionally fueled vehicles cytecs plugin hybrids
                produce almost 69 less co2 pull up to our wrexham or heanor uk sites and youll find rapid
                charging stations for plugin hybrids the driving range of a plugin hybrid can vary from 20 to
                40 miles which means that many employees can drive to work charge their vehicles and return
                home on purely electric power
                driving either a hybrid or a plugin hybrid vehicle is a winwinwin situation for the environment
                the driver and cytec in addition to adding less pollution to the environment drivers of these
                vehicles pay less in fees to the government company car drivers in the uk pay charges on their
                corporate cars and cytec stands to realize significant savings in fuel costs
