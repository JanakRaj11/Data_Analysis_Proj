                    2000 billion yen usd 20 billion and evolved into a global organization with more than
                   100000 employees around the world

                    the foundation of our business activities is the ricoh way which is comprised of our
                    founding principles and management philosophy we seek to earn trust and continue to
                    thrive by helping customers manage their information develop their enterprises and solve
                    their business problems at the same time we as a group have made it our mission to
                    contribute to social and environmental sustainability alongside the growth of our organization

                    as globalization advances the problems surrounding society and our planets resources
                    are becoming more complex and interrelated in parallel our business environment is
                    transforming at an ever faster pace it is therefore imperative now and in the future that
                    we raise our corporate value not only by delivering greater profitability but also by being
                    an effective force in efforts to solve global issues

                    in response to these challenges the ricoh groups 17th midterm management plan
                    initiated in april 2011 defined business creation and integration and the establishment
                    of highly efficient management as its key strategies we have also strengthened and
                    expanded our imaging business  the main generator of our revenue  while actively
                    developing new businesses

                    in fiscal 2013 structural reforms implemented throughout the group increased profits
                    in our core business and enabled us to bring new value to our customers in the area
                    of industrial products for example we entered new markets that allowed us to use our
                    optical technology to advantage yet we continue to take on the challenge of helping
                    our customers build their future success and every member of the ricoh group remains
                    focused on creating customer value

                    we believe that through the sum of our initiatives we can meet the diverse expectations
                    of all our stakeholders while simultaneously growing our business that is what it means
                    to act in accordance with the ricoh way

 what is covered by the fourth key                        future we want so that we can change ourselves
 initiative improve resource efficiency               and realize that vision
                                                              i want the ricoh group to be an organization
 over the past few years we have pursued structural       that through its success benefits not only the
 reform eliminating duplicate functions streamlining    present generation but also generations to come our
 work processes and reassigning personnel to              challenge is to create new value for our customers
 achieve greater efficiency we have given priority       the future of humanity and the future of the global
 to the allocation of personnel capital and other        environment
 resources to enterprises that involve a great deal of
 customer contact or that have growth potential the
 returns from these decisions are increasing day to
 day as proven by lower total costs and the launch
 and growth of new businesses
     but structural reform requires persistence
 we will not stop transforming until every group
 company and employee can focus on creating value
 that satisfies and inspires our customers
     i have been with ricoh for some 40 years and
 during that time i have worked in several regions and
 countries and in many organizations everywhere i
 went i found teams of people with a high degree of
 professionalism as well as wideranging curiosity that
 extended beyond their specialties their individual
 efforts became an exponentially greater force when
 they worked together i seek to build a corporate
 culture in which the collective strength of each
 person working autonomously with a strong sense of
 mission and integrity is firmly entrenched

 in closing tell us how the ricoh group is
 going to design the future

 the ricoh group has many assets technical know
 how supporting a rich range of products outstanding
 solution development and service expertise and a
 powerful global and local sales network these assets
 represent the potential for a new business model
 that can provide great benefits to our customers and
 society i believe they will enable us to head into a
 bright new future
      in april 2012 the ricoh group adopted
imagine change as its corporate brand message
 it reflects the reality that we are now at a stage
 where our challenges can no longer be answered
 by a mere extension of ongoing operations the
                                                                   we see opportunities in supporting
 emergence of the internet brought enormous
 changes to global society making old ways
                                                                    work styles that are untethered
 of thinking and doing no longer effective as                       from the office and have launched
 a response to todays challenges yet this era
 presents a tremendous opportunity for innovation                  business models that help
 we therefore have to imagine  that is think
 about things from a future point of view we                       customers deal with issues that
 must stay sensitive to changes in the business
 environment and also have a clear vision of the                   arise with new ways of working

   csr global governance and monitoring across the group

   our social responsibility efforts evolve in three stages from assessing legal regulatory and other external
   requirements to mission and responsibilitydriven voluntary activities that proactively meet expectations from
   society to the third stage where we work to create shared value by solving social issues while concurrently
   accelerating our growth
       to govern and monitor groupwide activity in each of the three stages we deploy our csr management cycle
       under this system the head office collects information and feedback from operating organizations on the
   ground to identify and provide necessary support the head office and operating units also hold periodic opinion
   exchanges and discussion forums to improve the quality of their respective csr activities

  carbon offsetting in europe the generali example

  the swiss branch of the insurance company generali was the first business in europe to receive the ricoh
  groups certificate of carbon offset and the second in europe to achieve complete carbon offsetting
      generali introduced ricohs managed document service mds four years ago and decided to implement carbon
  offsetting in its office printing environment in order to further promote its environmental conservation activities
      generalis co 2 reduction initially began by switching to new models but ricoh europe plc re took
  it further and proposed solutions that restrict resource consumption these included the use of ricoh eco
                                                                                                                         ricohs concept of
  technologies such as quick startup qsu which wakes a printer to full readiness in a few seconds from              document management

   a message from our partner the center for human rights education and training


   an awareness of human rights is key to being a global citizen
   it was a great pleasure for us to work with ricoh in developing elearning materials that reveal international
   developments in human rights and their relevance to corporate activities
       in recent years interest in corporate social responsibility has grown in pace with economic globalization
   reflecting this trend the united nations global compact iso26000 and other international frameworks are
   becoming de facto guidelines for corporate activities
       as human rights are mainstreamed into business practices
   integrating human rights considerations into every employees
   everyday work is vital for a company to achieve growth and
   contribute to society
       we hope the elearning materials we jointly developed will help csr
   and human rights initiatives spread throughout the entire ricoh group

     with a network of 24 hospitals 38 consultation centers and 10000 medical professionals treating over four million
     patients annually usp  quiron hospital group is one of the largest private operators of hospitals in spain
          previously the group generated over 20 million paperbased medical records every year this legacy system
     however compromised patient care and required significant administrative resource to maintain patient records
     were fragmented there was little standardization of forms and it took time to retrieve critical information and
     share it with relevant departments
          referencing its document management expertise and knowledge of the healthcare sector ricoh españa slu
     migrated the group to an electronic health record ehr system with automated workflows and electronic forms
          the ehr system provides endtoend management of patient records now medical records are scanned at
     the point of admission and uploaded to the ehr when a patient attends a group hospital for the first time new
     information such as pathology notes generated while the patient is in the hospitals care is appended using
     electronic forms eforms
          this has transformed administration at usp hospitales key workers can now access complete electronic
     records on demand information is shared instantly enabling clinicians to make better informed decisions in less
     time billing cycles are shorter as well with administrative staff able to quickly access insurance records
          to safeguard patient confidentiality the electronic records are encrypted floor space that had been used to
     store paperbased records has been liberated and the hospital group is enjoying a 20 reduction in document
     related costs
          the ehr system has dramatically improved
     productivity and is allowing clinicians to focus more
     time on patient care  web

   that employees are collaborators in the growth of our business the councils
   central meetings serve as a forum for communication between senior executives
   and other employees with top management sharing information concerning the

   from 14 offices
        the information is subsequently conveyed to all employees through workplace
   meetings as well as through the councils newsletters additional sectional
   meetings are held to deliberate companywide issues such as pay raises bonuses
   and event schedules and the results of these deliberations are presented to ricohs
   senior executives

                                          resource conservation and recycling
                                          our goal is to reduce the consumption of new resources by 25 by 2020 from the 2007 level to
                                          reach that goal we utilize materials in the most effective way possible including minimization of
                                          new inputs we are making our products smaller and lighter employing parts with longer lifecycles
