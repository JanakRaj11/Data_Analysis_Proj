    on the damage to our infrastructure ordered the dispatch of vehicle
    base stations and mobile power supply cars and procured personnel
    fuel and relief goods for the local site support team
       in cooperation with the engineering division as well as kddi group
    companies and partners we set out on the early restoration of
    communications services including the repair of base station facilities
    and access lines to cellular base stations to restore the cellular base                            vehicle base stations rikuzentakata iwate prefecture
    stations we introduced the largezone base station scheme and
    used satellite links and terrestrial micropower radio to connect to the
    base stations by the end of april we were able to restore coverage to
    the same level as before the earthquake excluding the restricted area
    in which the fukushima nuclear power plants are situated

9     kddi csr report 2011

healthy is a question i have long been asking myself
ishida all kinds of corporate managers face this question that is
the very reason why dialogues are needed it is one channel by
which to build the relationship between a company and its
stakeholders by discussing issues with citizens and npos
ngos you can gain insights into the problems that need to be
addressed which can lead to sustainable business for
instance companies human rights awareness is rising in
recent years but it wasnt the case formerly on another note
compliance was never mentioned with a sense of reality ten
years ago but nowadays it is firmly actualized it is vitally important
to keep up the highest level of sensitivity when getting involved with
diverse stakeholders if we ought to appreciate social issues
kuroda it is crucial for a company to be conscious of the fact
that it is a member of the community and that it carries out the          equality and fairness which the world today is most
efforts necessary for that community even if those efforts do              concerned about in alleviating social inequality taking the
not directly concern its line of business nevertheless efforts           kddi mobile phone learning class as an example these
that are not part of business tend to be on the back burner in             classes are held to provide equal opportunity4 it is important
the light of budgets considering continuity and sustainability           for kddi to have that attitude of taking the initiative and to
shareholders are easier to persuade with csr efforts related to            clearly convey that message to the society
the companys line of business and moreover in                           midorikawa the world has radically changed if we compare the
telecommunications the business itself has a social                       1990s and the 2000s previously npos and companies were
contribution factor by taking advantage of that feature kddi             opposed to each other but now the basic line is to
can lead its business to resolving the various issues in society          cooperate on the level of social business a common ground
midorikawa the line of business is always the past and                  that allows entry for both the companies and ngos was
presentwhat a company should do in the future depends on                  formedall the more reason for kddi to intensify its
the changes in society a company doesnt necessarily need to              communicative power and constantly demonstrate a strong
pursue only the current business                                          presence i also hope that kddi will build up the corporate
shimatani in that sense kdd3 has conducted a threemonth                capabilities that will enable that accomplishment
training sessions for engineers in africa and other areas for              tanaka since we were up to now thinking in the scope of
more than 30 years i have heard that one of those trainees                what telecommunications could do i think our views have
later became the countrys minister of communications it is an            been provincial we would like to identify the things we can do
example of contribution to the community that does not have a              among the needs of the society and the positioning of such
direct relationship with our business                                     efforts in our business activities
ishida even if a matter is not an imperative that must be done            ishida i suggest narrowing down the issues from a social
in order to prevent the company from falling apart by the time            perspective and then become specialized in dealing with the
the issue surfaces five or ten years later it may be too late to          selected issues
correct the direction to the needs of the age for this reason            tanaka speaking of bracnet mentioned at the beginning of
a company must look toward being a step ahead of the current               this discussion we promoted this with the understanding of
situation seen in this light meeting csr requires cunning             our social assignment specifically the advantages we have as
in order to lead the world and challenge it good                          a company and the social benefits we can deliver this
communication is the key for example a tieup with an                    business is growing but the situation is quite challenging for
international ngo can bestow new visions on the company                   social contribution without the continuity of the company we
midorikawa japan has an entrenched and prevalent culture                  cannot attain our objectives the balance between business
of preferring to become number two instead of number                      and social contribution is difficult i believe bracnet is a good
one the first one risks the most therefore people target               project that realizes the synergy of business and social
the second as a safer choice there may be some                            contribution but we have yet to understand how much it
differences based on industry but companies are now                       accounts for what the world is demanding and what
challenged to seek activities that aim for the top of the                  significance this project has
world breaking free of this tradition                                    kuroda i see bracnet as an innovative project the
                                                                           circumstances of management that you mentioned are
changes in social roles assumed by a company                               something inevitable in running a sustainable business
                                                                           including the current state of affairs and business performance
ishida povertystruck countries have very high expectations of            it would be appreciated if you were to disclose and
a deeppocketed enterprise how should we approach                         communicate those processes

     then we had the earthquake in march what was vastly               limited scope
     different about the recovery from the damage left by this          midorikawa first i wrote education and equality education
     earthquake from previous recovery efforts was that there           in japan must change fundamentally the way of education
     were many human interactions in the devastated areas            should be reconsidered broadly including university education
     as a symbolic story when the kddi work vehicles entered           and employee training in europe and the us thorough

     ishida maybe it was the kddi philosophy that was at the                                                 with this established we

four material issues for csr
of the wide range of issues with which kddis business activities intersect in fy2008 we extracted a number of topics of significant
social concern as kddis four material issues for csr that we particularly need to focus our efforts on for kddi to sustainably grow
together with society at large
  at the kddi csr  environment committee meeting held in march 2009 we reported the four material issues we had selected
and after that we took diverse actions toward the resolution of the issues
  fy2011 is the fourth year after the selection of the four material issues kddi will approach these social issues with a broader
perspective than before and reexamine the issues on which we should focus our efforts

our response to the thirdparty opinion
through the experience of the great east japan earthquake we were able to reacknowledge the weight of our
social responsibility as a company that assumes a telecommunications lifeline and review our csr efforts we
reported on our csr efforts via this report based on iso 26000 an international standard for social responsibility
issued in november 2010
   as evaluated by ms akiyama we focused on the dialogues with stakeholders in approaching the material
issues on the other hand we were able to realize which areas we need to improve such as human rights for
these issues we will incorporate them into our future challenges for improvement
   as for the actualization of the three commitments more connected more global more diverse values
that we announced in april 2011 as our mediumterm business policy we will bear in the mind ms akiyamas                   shinichi muramoto
