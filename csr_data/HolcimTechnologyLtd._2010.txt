                       and society to ensure license to operate is more
                       important than ever

                       in the two years since our last corporate sustainable development report the economic crisis has affected many
                       regions and sectors however as sustainable development is such a fundamental objective we remain committed to
                       its principles our commitment to sustainability engages our people and also allows us to operate more efficiently 
                       providing us with competitive advantage throughout the entire value chain


                       the most important contribution to sustainable development is through products and services by offering value

                        like all players  try to increase the efficiency of the use of scarce resources and avoid material loss in production
                       processes wherever possible we have together with the international union for conservation of nature iucn
                       created an expert panel to advise us on how to manage biodiversity the panel has already visited holcim sites in
                       a number of countries and has provided invaluable guidance


                       reduction of co2 emissions continues to be an area of focus in 2009 we achieved the co2 emission reduction target
                       earlier than planned and are pleased to report that co2 emissions per tonne of cement were more than 20 lower
                       than in the reference year of 1990 holcim also actively participates in the policy debate on climate change and on
                       effective regulatory incentives to improve energy efficiency and co2 containment




                                            sustainability is an integral part of the group strategy even in difficult times holcim takes its
                                            environmental and social responsibilities very seriously programs to strengthen the safety culture

this report reflects a number of new targets that have been set at an even higher level
     we now aim to further reduce our specific net co2 emissions by 2015 to 25 below the 1990 benchmark
     we will be developing and rolling out a comprehensive biodiversity management system of sites situated
      in high biodiversity value areas 80 must have biodiversity action plans in place by 2013
     recognizing that building constructive and trustful relationships with communities in which we operate
      is imperative all plants are bound to have community engagement plans by 2012


safety of employees subcontractors and third parties remains an area of concern and key focus management
continues to improve the effectiveness and impact of safety programs and directives to change mindsets and to
embed a culture of safety can still be a challenge in some places but we remain committed to our vision of zero
harm to people


the current report describes our path toward sustainability as we understand it for our industry it discloses
performance data across a broad range of indicators including those from the global reporting initiative relevant
to our specific businesses and has been externally assured a panel of external stakeholders has also contributed to
this report with valuable guidance and comments


we have been in continuous contact with stakeholders and have recently joined the corporate support group of
the international committee of the red cross icrc we look forward to cooperating in specific conflictaffected
countries where both holcim and the icrc operate humanitarian actors like the icrc substantially contribute to
stabilizing the operating environment in such areas


holcims efforts in the area of csr and sd have been well recognized the best evidence is the many awards received
by group companies holcim has also been confirmed as a member in the dow jones sustainability world index for

                                                stewardship  that is to be responsible not only for the resources below ground but also for the

                                                extraction of mineral resources but these can be mitigated in many different ways through targeted
                                                management actions ultimately this could sometimes even lead to biodiversity enhancements
