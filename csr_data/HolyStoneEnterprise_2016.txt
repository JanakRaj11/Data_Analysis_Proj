in addition to iso14001 certified we also file environmental information accurately to the authority in accordance with regulations this allows us
to track the flow of wastes in order to eﬀectively manage and avoid secondary pollution in addition we also carry on waste reduction and recycle
and reuse such materials as paper rolls pallets parcel boxes furthermore grouping finished products as many as possible and recycling ro
wastewater and waste solvents also help with waste reduction


waste recycle
for waste recycle diverging management for waste water with highmediumlow intensity was implemented at plating station in october 2015
and recovery of tin prepregging function was underway at the same time aiming to avoid the decrease in output of highly intensive solvent the
project was scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of 2016 with the hope of decreasing waste water and processing fee by carrying
out diverging management above a total of 5945 liters of highly intensive solvent was reduced in 2015 within department of ceramic substrate
the company will continue to keep an eye out for latest regulations and act on relevant proposals for 2016 the company will be planning
processing agency audit aiming to increase eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness in waste recycle
