message from the chairman

dear stakeholders


last year was another good year for bouwinvest we saw a strong recovery on the real estate markets both in the
netherlands and globally this led to good returns in our dutch and international portfolios more importantly
virtually all our funds outperformed the industry benchmarks on a longterm base which shows that our
investment strategy is working and that we are making the right choices we invested a total of  782 million last
year with  522 million in our dutch portfolio and  260 million in international investments this was lower than
the record investment of  11 billion in 2014 but was still a good performance given the fierce competition on the
market and our strict quality criteria


we made progress on a number of fronts and in line with the investment plan of our investor bpfbouw our assets
under management grew once again to  75 billion from  67 billion at yearend 2014 despite the office funds
disposal of a large portfolio of offices that no longer meet the funds strategic premises we also continued to
improve the diversity of the portfolio adding assets to both our hotel and healthcare funds and internationally
increasing our asiapacific and listed allocation we see a lot of potential in the healthcare real estate sector given
the combination of ageing of the population and higher life expectancy

we retained our existing investors in our dutch sector funds and welcomed eight investors to our main three
funds this means we have now welcomed a total of 11 institutional investors in addition to bpfbouw to our
funds in just over two years of course this has helped us achieve another of our targets which was to diversify
the funding for our investment funds


this underlines the growing interest in real estate investment among institutional investors real estate is a
perfect longterm investment for pension funds and other institutional investors with longterm commitments
returns are stable and relatively strong compared to stocks and bonds in addition risks are under control and
real estate offers institutional investors the opportunity to diversify their investment portfolios real estate also
enables them to create value  beyond the financial benefits  in society as a whole it provides homes creates
employment and is a very tangible investment you cannot underestimate the importance of that element


we believe these factors will continue to drive investment in the real estate sector in the years ahead looking to
the future we are convinced that investors want to choose whether they invest in the netherlands or on an
international level the netherlands is just one small part of a global market which is itself getting smaller and
smaller as the worlds major markets like the united states europe and the asiapacific region become
increasingly transparent we can benefit from this globalisation as we have built up a lot of experience and
expertise in international real estate after all we currently have some  26 billion invested in international real
estate via both listed and unlisted funds with healthy returns


bouwinvest realises its investments strategy with a team of 140 people 1311 fte all based in amsterdam we
have the right strategy and the right focus plus we have solid and sustainable partnerships with the best local
experts because just as we focus on our core regions in the netherlands we focus on what we believe are the core
regions on a global scale and the investment managers based in those regions


due to continuing urbanisation around the world we believe the biggest growth  and the biggest increases in
value  will be in the major cities of certain countries or regions so on an international level we focus very
specifically on major cities in what we see as the future powerhouses of the global economy of course we invest
in markets that have transparent real estate sectors plus we work with partners that have solid track records and
that reflect our own focus on quality we and our anchor investor are convinced that this international investment
strategy will provide solid returns long into the future which is why bpfbouw has decided to increase the
strategic proportion of international investments to 40 of its assets under management the remaining 60 will
remain invested in our five dutch sector funds

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                     9



this faith in our international investments was certainly justified in 2015 as our international portfolio delivered
an outstanding return of 192 on its listed and unlisted funds with some help from a strong us dollar we are of
course very pleased to report that our five dutch funds also delivered good performances last year 87 we
booked an overall return of 128 and on a weighted average outperformed the market




of course all of this puts very heavy demands on the bouwinvest organisation the good news is that last year we
once again made significant progress on a number of fronts at an organisational level as part of our operational
excellence drive we renewed and improved the risk reporting of our portfolio and bpfbouws entire portfolio we
also conducted integrated integrity risk analyses and arranged integrity training courses for all our people our
efforts aimed at creating a pleasant and challenging working environment are also paying off last year no less
than 95 of our staff participated in our employee engagement survey our score for employee satisfaction
improved once again to 80 from 78 in 2013


on the csr front we are all proud that our three main sector funds were awarded gresb green star status for the
second year in a row of course we will have to work even harder to retain this status as sustainability criteria will
only become stricter and more important in the future but that is part and parcel of our mission  to generate
solid returns in a responsible manner  and inherent in our commitment to the longterm quality of our portfolio


all that remains is for me to thank all our employees for their commitment dedication and hard work over the past
year we can all be very proud of what we achieved in 2015


last year we bid farewell to marjanne sint as vicechairman of the supervisory board we would like to thank her
for her commitment and inspiration over the past eight years and her contribution to bouwinvests success we
wish marjanne every success in the future her seat has been taken by carolien gehrels whom we welcomed as
new member in july 2015

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                  16



real estate is now a fullfledged asset class in its own right with transparent global investment markets and strict
corporate governance requirements several global demographic trends such as ongoing urbanisation the
increase in the number of smaller households and the ageing population will increase the demand for residential
retail and office real estate in the coming decades

real estate also gives institutional investors the opportunity to diversify their portfolios at country and sector
levels while providing a better riskreturn profile than either stocks or bonds on top of this stable rental income
and annual rent increases add an inflation hedge to investments enabling institutional investors to keep pace
with their obligations this is why an increasing number of investors are looking for the right investment manager
to increase their exposure to global real estate

dutch real estate funds in which institutional investors can participate



market highlights and trends
international markets
global real estate markets flourished in 2015 with worldwide investment volumes reaching or even exceeding
precrisis levels driven by low interest rates real estate has become an attractive alternative to riskaverse
investors searching for stable returns investment yields are well below their longterm average in all regions
however supported by alltime low yields on riskfree alternatives yield gaps remain healthy and are attracting
more capital to real estate most global markets benefited in 2015 and saw solid capital growth the favourable
occupier market outlook for welllocated assets now seems largely incorporated in todays prices and is starting to
push some investors to slightly offpitch properties


mega trends are driving demand in the occupier market globalisation affects the way people interact and office
space demand is becoming more internationally oriented the growing number of worldwide flights is creating
solid fundamentals for the hotel market large international retailers are spreading their concepts across borders
and now dominate local retail markets while the huge upsurge in online retail is changing the retail landscape
with an increasing demand for stateoftheart logistics real estate a continuous stream of people is being drawn
towards urban areas which means that demographic outlooks are very different even within countries this and
the major increase in single person and twoperson households is creating enormous demand for residential real
estate especially in metropolitan areas meanwhile the worldwide ageing of the population is likely to boost
demand for healthcarerelated real estate such as care homes and assisted living facilities the urbanisation trend
is also increasing the competition between individual cities and a simple countrylevel approach is no longer
sufficient for global real estate investors

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                     17



this is why bouwinvest incorporated a city ranking in its global market monitor which compares key indicators
across countries and cities for each real estate sector a final ranking shows regions attractive for residential
office retail and logistics investments on the office and logistics markets cities in the asianpacific apac region
are performing exceptionally well  the top ten of the office ranking includes eight apac cities and the logistics
ranking includes five north america is performing well on all key indicators in the global market monitor canada
the unites states and mexico are all in the top ten countries worldwide large liquid markets like new york and
washington dc and highperforming tech metros like boston and san francisco top the rankings on a city level
european countries stand out on the residential ranking supported by strong market activity in germany the
netherlands and sweden


dutch market
the dutch real estate market has recovered swiftly and investment appetite is growing dutch pension funds
invested in 2015 in the netherlands and are looking to expand their allocation to real estate in the next few years
in addition to dutch investors international investors are increasing their investments dramatically in fact most
real estate investments in the netherlands now come from international investors dutch prime markets are still
attractively priced compared to other key markets as london paris and munich where prices have already
increased to precrisis levels however the interest from both dutch and international investors is quickly pushing
up prices and investors are broadening their view from a strong focus on prime to include subprime locations


after several rough years the dutch residential market has gradually recovered the increased number of
households and low production of housing stock during the crisis has resulted in a structural housing shortage
driven by urbanisation housing shortages have rapidly pushed up prices in the countrys main cities especially
amsterdam a combination of stable rental growth and yield shift resulted in very positive total returns in 2015
changes to government policies have affected the housing market and increased demand for liberalised sector
rental homes a product that is perfectly suited for institutional investors looking for stable direct returns


office space demand is very sensitive to economic cycles after several lean years economic growth has picked up
and prospects for the office market now look promising however a surge in companies looking for cost
efficiencies and new technologies are changing qualitative demand tenants are focusing on specific location
types but are also less bound to their offices and are looking for more flexibility prime office locations include
highquality and multitenant offices with excellent road and public transport accessibility in regions with a ready
pool of highlyskilled employees on the other hand a group of secondary locations are gradually losing tenants
leaving large office buildings completely vacant this polarisation trend between prime and secondary is expected
to continue in the next few years


polarisation is also affecting the dutch retail market in 2015 several large dutch retailer chains struggled to keep
up with the changes in consumer market dynamics some were forced to file for bankruptcy leaving a large
number of square metres vacant others were forced to renegotiate their lease terms on a more positive note a
large number of major international retail chains such as primark and zara have adapted swiftly and now have a
solid position on the dutch retail market retailer demand seems to be focused on highquality largescale retail
units in prime locations most experts expect to see further differentiation in the retail landscape in terms of
prime and secondary retail real estate



portfolio results
international investments
bouwinvest invests globally in residential retail office logistic hotels and some other real estate sectors such as
selfstorage and parking all these investments are indirect investments via listed and unlisted real estate funds
joint ventures and club deals as a manager of pension fund assets the international investment team aims to
generate stable and regular annual returns of around 7 to hedge our clients longterm liabilities the main goal
of the substantial increase of the allocation to international real estate in recent years was to increase the
diversification of bpfbouws real estate investments for one it has enabled our anchor investor to diversify
geographically steadily increasing the allocation to promising regions such as the asiapacific and united states
markets and away from its initial focus in europe it also adds another layer of diversification through its exposure
to real estate sectors in different countries for instance the office sectors in australia the united states or japan
are quite different from the dutch office sector

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                       18



the addition of listed funds three years ago added yet another level of diversification enabling us to fill a number
of gaps in our international portfolio by investing capital in sectors that offered interesting investment
opportunities with higher returns than generally available from unlisted funds the international investment
portfolio also provides our client with a more diversified risk profile global real estate markets are dynamic but
market corrections and crises tend to affect the various sectors differently in different countries a balanced
exposure to the various sectors in different regions acts as a hedge on market volatility


bouwinvests investments in global mezzanine debt markets add another layer of diversification to its
international portfolio with the right expertise exposure to mezzanine debt gives investors access to highquality
properties and borrowers currently on very favourable terms these investments generate attractive riskadjusted
returns and provide additional lowcost exposure to real estate sectors often difficult to access via either listed or
unlisted funds


bpfbouws firm commitment to its international portfolio enabled bouwinvests international investment team to
invest in the worlds real estate markets even during the various crises of recent years this enabled us to take
advantage of opportunities when other investors were withdrawing from the market we are a longterm investor
but we have the flexibility to use shortterm volatility to our advantage we were encouraged to see that our best
performing funds in 2015 included both funds we invested in recently and those we invested in a number of years
ago such as logistics real estate in australia and office real estate in the united states


bouwinvests international investment team has a very strong focus on developed economies where the real
estate markets are transparent and liquid we will not invest in countries with poor records in terms of
transparency or corruption on a country level the main focus is on major cities as we believe that sustainable
longterm returns will be driven by a number of trends that will favour large cities in the future these include
ongoing urbanisation which will create mega cities in certain parts of the world with a concomitant growth in
employment offices and a surge in demand for residential and retail real estate another trend is the growth of
online shopping which is increasing demand for stateoftheart logistics facilities one of the focus areas of the
international portfolio also given the huge surge in tourism expected in the coming decades demand is likely to
far outstrip supply in the hotel sector making this an excellent investment opportunity the rapid ageing of the
population in countries like japan combined with higher life expectancy will also increase the need for
healthcarerelated real estate and we see this as very promising sector for the future the growing affluence in the
asia pacific region will drive a number of real estate trends especially in the residential sector for one it is likely
to lead to a huge increase in demand for student accommodation another sector we are monitoring very closely


another major priority for bouwinvests international investment team is the quality of the underlying real estate
we see a very strong correlation between the performance of indirect real estate investments and the quality of
the underlying real estate itself when making an investment decision therefore we assign a great deal of weight
to analyse underlying rental income occupancy and potential rental growth this makes the sustainability of the
underlying real estate extremely important and we apply strict esg criteria in all our investments we also work
exclusively with top notch local fund managers in all of the countries in which we invest the investment fund
managers we work with understand the dna of a pension fund and act as an extension of the bouwinvest
investment philosophy they know their markets intimately have solid track records good governance and share
our focus on quality and sustainability in 2015 we were pleased to note that once again a higher proportion of the
fund managers we work with signed up for the gresb sustainability assessment and that our managers gresb
scores were higher than in 2014 we also like to be major participants in the funds in which we invest as this
enables us to exert influence on investment decisions and strategies we have built up very strong relationships
with a large number of fund managers and this has proven to be a major advantage over the years


of course such a diverse portfolio comes with its own unique set of challenges one of our biggest challenges is
making truly sustainable investments the built environment accounts for a very large proportion of harmful
emissions and we are already seeing cities virtually shut down due to pollution this is why we have made a firm
commitment to make a contribution to a cleaner and healthier built environment by only investing in real estate
that complies with very strict sustainability criteria another challenge is that it is becoming harder to find the
right investment product  the underlying real estate  as the huge surge in capital looking for real estate
investments is making the global real estate market extremely competitive


real estate markets are volatile and virtually all markets  national regional and sectors  experience corrections
at some point our edge in this case is the sheer diversity of our portfolio plus we have the expertise market
knowledge and resources to take advantage of shortterm corrections

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                   19



the worlds markets  including real estate  are also affected by the geopolitical issues that abound today we
monitor all our markets very closely with the help of our local partners interest rates are currently at historical
lows making real estate a remarkably attractive asset class but rates will increase in the future property prices
will continue to rise but not at todays rates on the other hand yields have come down in line with interest rates
but yields are likely to increase in the future at least in primary unleveraged markets

what this means in the long term is that we expect annual net returns to stabilise at 78


the performance on bouwinvests international investments continued its strong course in 2015 leading to a total
return of 127 for 2015 before currency results and after management fees when currency results are included
the total return amounts to 192 after management fees both the unlisted 140 and the listed investments
100 contributed to the total return from the following section onwards all figures are excluding currency
results unless otherwise stated the best performing region in 2015 was europe the sale of a berlin residential
portfolio well above its book value combined with strong listed real estate returns lead to a 161 return in
europe driven by yield compression due to capital inflows both the unlisted 179 and the listed investments
161 contributed to the total return


the 2015 performance of 68 for the asia pacific portfolio showed some recovery from the correction due to the
global fear of economic slowdown of chinese economic growth forecasts despite the turmoil in china the listed
performance remained positive with a 28 return for 2015 the unlisted funds showed a strong 83 performance
driven by the australian and japanese investments


the northern american portfolio finished the year with a total return of 130 the united states real estate
market is likely to remain in the mature phase of the cycle with property yields at record lows the longexpected
interest rate increase by the fed in december 2015 has left the market virtually untouched


at yearend 2015 the average leverage in the international portfolio had fallen to 30 from an average of 336 in
2014 the total value of the international investments portfolio stood at  26 billion at yearend 2015 compared
with  24 billion a year earlier total new commitments came in at  260 million in 2015 in line with the growth
strategy outlined in bpfbouws mandate for international investments the divestments gained speed in 2015 due
to the increased market liquidity resulted in the realisation of exit plans for many assets in several closedend
funds in europe and north america


exchange rates contributed  143 million while valuation movements also added  182 million to the growth of the
portfolio in 2015


europe
bouwinvest is confident about the longterm real estate fundamentals for investing in europe economies are
recovering in many european countries and gdp growth is up low interest rates and the poor returns from
fixedrate bond investments plus the volatility of stock markets means there is an enormous amount of
international capital looking for investments in real estate this has added a lot of liquidity to the european real
estate market the continued economic recovery is also having a positive impact on rental values in most
european countries the massive surge in ecommerce and online shopping is driving demand for logistics real
estate of course this has affected the retail real estate market and made it even more important to invest in
prime retail to guarantee rental income growth and solid returns there is also healthy demand for both
residential and prime office real estate however while europe as a whole is recovering a great deal of the
economic recovery is concentrated in the larger cities of northwestern europe in countries like germany the
united kingdom france and the nordics these countries also tend to have the most welldeveloped and
transparent real estate markets rapid urbanisation is driving population growth in larger european cities and
leading to population shrinkage in parts of most countries bouwinvests european investments are therefore
largely focused on cities and metropolitan areas with the best economic and demographic outlook


bouwinvests current european real estate investment portfolio is wellpositioned for solid returns in the coming
years the portfolio is wellbalanced both in terms of its country spread and in terms of sector focus while a
number of niche investments add another layer of diversification

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                    20



all these investment are structured as funds club deals joint ventures and listed real estate companies we also
have a paneuropean portfolio of mezzanine debt many of the current investments in closedend funds entered
precrisis are due to expire in the period to 2017 the unlisted portfolio includes shopping centres and mezzanine
debt longlease investments and logistics in the united kingdom and retail investments in france and sweden in
germany we have a large residential portfolio while on a paneuropean level we have a large exposure to the
thriving logistics sector


in 2015 we continued to look for investment opportunities in the united kingdom residential market especially in
the greater london area and are optimistic on european office funds with a main city focus as economic and
demographic growth is concentrated in europes larger cities europes junior and mezzanine debt markets are
also developing quite rapidly and we committed our exposure to this market as it offers solid returns with
relatively little risk we believe the market will offer some excellent investment opportunities the midrental
residential segment across europe is very promising as the supply is still fairly limited and demand is high again
especially in the large cities most new complexes are therefore fully occupied on completion and there is a lot of
potential rent value growth europe is still in the early stages of recovery so the residential office and retail
markets also have a lot potential for good investments if you have the right expertise and the ability and
resources to take advantage of opportunities real estate markets are changing so rapidly our strategy in europe
is to maintain a solid layer of longterm listed and unlisted investments while remaining flexible enough to take
advantage of shifts in the various markets and new investment opportunities


bouwinvest prefers to take major stakes and play an active role in the funds we invest in this enables us to
influence the funds investment decisions and strategies on several fronts including sustainability in this very
dynamic environment we firmly believe that solid partnerships with local fund managers and investment
managers are the best way to guarantee stable longterm returns for our client we devote a great deal of
attention to finding the right partners and all our local partners have excellent track records we have also worked
with many of our partners since before the crisis and working through crises is a very good way to get to know
who the best fund managers are we also prefer to work with investment managers who share bouwinvests
investment philosophy and understand the investment priorities of pension funds one of these priorities is
sustainability and a growing number of our partners now use gresb assessments to measure and improve their
sustainability performance as this this will be increasingly important as we move forward


north america
the north american real estate sector is a highly attractive investment market due to its longterm characteristics
the region boasts healthy population growth and the united states economy has now recovered and moved into
growth mode and economic growth has been gradual so this is not a boom and bust scenario this has resulted in
rental growth in most sectors which is very good for the real estate sector the balance of supply and demand is
also generally in good shape especially in the major cities for instance the office sector is not suffering from the
massive oversupply we see in europe while office buildings neglected during the crisis offer a lot of valueadd
potential on top of this investor appetite is strong which adds a good deal of liquidity to the market


the residential and logistics sectors are leading the pack although there is healthy demand for classa office in
large cities areas the majority of the investments are concentrated in the metropolitan areas with the best
economic and demographic outlook these offer the best prospects for job growth and tend to be the most desired
places to live

bouwinvest has built up a wellbalanced and diversified real estate investment portfolio in north america over the
15 years it has been investing in the region the current portfolio consists of a number of  mainly core 
sectorspecific holdings plus a number of diversified and niche investments the portfolio consists of investments
in unlisted funds joint ventures coinvestments club deals and listed real estate companies


over the years bouwinvest has shifted the focus of its portfolio away from a majority of closedend funds as this
made it more difficult to execute strategies quickly enough the shift towards a more diversified strategy with a
balance of core valueadd and opportunistic investments has made the portfolio both more resilient and more
flexible investing in more openended funds also gave the portfolio a more stable layer as there was no longer any
danger of a large part of the portfolio terminating simultaneously the addition of listed funds to the portfolio
three years ago was fully in line with this strategy as it put control firmly in bouwinvests hands rather than the
manager of the funds

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                    21



the north american portfolio has exposure to a diverse range of sectors via both listed and unlisted funds
including residential retail office and logistics the logistics sector is growing rapidly on the back of the growing
popularity of online sales while the return to gdp growth is driving demand for retail and office space residential
is another key market for investment as the reurbanisation of the united states is driving up demand for rental
homes in a number of the countrys larger cities highend multifamily residential rental homes apartment
buildings are performing extremely well


for instance bouwinvests decision to support its united states investment manager clarion in its bid to acquire
the gables apartment fund at the end of 2014 turned out to be a very good move as the gables fund turned out to
be one of last years best performers at usd 180 million it is currently the largest single investment in the united
states portfolio bouwinvests mezzanine debt investments started in 2014 in the us add another layer to the
portfolio and promise to deliver good returns at fairly low risk


bouwinvests strategy is to be a major and active participant in the funds we invest in so we can influence
investment decisions and strategies we are also firm believers in forging strong partnerships with local
investment specialists and fund managers as this has proven to be the key to providing our client with the optimal
balance of risks and returns we prefer to work with local partners who share our investment philosophy and our
priorities on the sustainability front the fact that more and more of our partners are now using gresb to assess
and improve their esg credentials is very encouraging as sustainability criteria will only become more important
in the future


asiapacific
bouwinvest is positive on the longterm fundamentals for the asiapacific region these include resilient economic
growth and socioeconomic trends such as the unprecedented rate of urbanisation and a rapidly growing middle
class this is creating opportunities for investments in infrastructure and the development of new real estate to
meet the rapidly increasing demand for residential retail offices and commercial real estate for instance
burgeoning online sales and increasing trade has led to heavy demand for modern logistics real estate increasing
wealth is also increasing the demand for student accommodation which we see as a promising niche market the
rapid ageing of the population and higher life expectancy in the region is expected to boost demand for real estate
in the healthcare sector especially in japan and we are considering investment opportunities in this sector asia is
also seeing a huge surge in international travel which will have a major impact in demand for hotel beds both in
asia itself and across the globe so the outlook for the hotel industry is very positive in view of these very strong
fundamentals bouwinvest has increased the allocation of investments in the asiapacific region to 25 of the
total international portfolio from the current 20


we focus primarily on the developed countries in the region such as japan australia singapore hong kong south
korea and certain cities in china these all have welldeveloped transparent and liquid real estate markets with
high financial governance standards the major growth in these countries will be in the larger urban centres so
our investments are concentrated on real estate in tierone cities such as tokyo and osaka in japan sydney and
melbourne in australia shanghai in china and the capitals of other asiapacific countries


bouwinvest has built up a balanced real estate investment portfolio in the asiapacific region it consists primarily
of country city and sectorspecific holdings in all the developed economies of the region our portfolio is a mix of
longterm core investments with some shortterm investments with a focus on adding value we currently have
investments in unlisted funds joint ventures coinvestments club deals combined with listed real estate
companies due to the huge amount of interest in the region in recent years the prices of prime real estate are
currently quite high we have adopted a cautious approach to investment for the near term and we are looking for
defensive investments as a hedge against any market corrections quite recently bouwinvest invested in retail
real estate in singapore and logistics real estate in australia and china although bouwinvest generally invests for
the long term we also opt for liquidity when market pricing is favourable one example is the liquidation after
three years of a tokyo office real estate investment in 2015 this generated an investment return of 26


bouwinvest aims to be a major and active participant in the funds we invest in as this enables us influence over
investment decisions and strategies we firmly believe the partnerships we forge with local investment specialists
and fund managers are the key to providing our client with the optimal balance of risks and returns

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                     22



global listed real estate
bouwinvests listed real estate portfolio is an integral part of our international real estate investment portfolio
bouwinvest started investing in listed real estate in late 2012 which now accounts for approximately 20 of the
total international portfolio the investments in listed real estate primarily serve as a complement to our unlisted
portfolio for the most part we have a buy and hold strategy for our listed real estate investments fully in line
with bouwinvests overall longterm investment strategy additionally listed investments add liquidity and enable
us to rebalance the portfolio in terms of allocations per region or sector in the future they also enhance the
riskreturn profile of the overall portfolio as the exposure can be brought in line with our riskreturn objectives
listed funds also provide an arbitrage opportunity between unlisted and listed real estate exposure of course
listed investments are very effective to diversify real estate investments across sectors and countries at
considerably lower capital requirements than investments in direct real estate


bouwinvests global listed portfolio currently consists of fourteen separate marketsector combinations with a
carefully selected limited number of holdings in listed real estate companies the global portfolio is based on our
expectations for various sectors in certain countries and very much based on forecasts for the real estate markets
in those countries investing in listed real estate has also enabled bouwinvest to invest in sectors difficult to gain
access to via unlisted funds for instance we were able to enter the united states retail market in 2012 and invest
in highquality regional shopping malls this type of retail assets are closely held by listed real estate companies
therefore it would not have been possible to achieve comparable diversified exposure to the underlying real estate
assets through nonlisted funds


in 2015 an investment in a closedend tokyo office fund came to end but we were able to regain access to the
highperformance tokyo office market via listed investments we have also decided to increase our exposure to the
us office market via listed funds provided the pricing is right other recent investments include assets in main
shopping streets in japan and chinese residential real estate


the way bouwinvest has set up and executes its investment strategy is recognised as unique and innovative
because the portfolio was growing so rapidly the listed funds team  which added an analyst this year  set itself
the task of devising and developing a system to monitor not just its current portfolio but all markets sectors and
funds that might be of interest one of the unique elements of this system is that it is being set up in close
cooperation with external partners as most daytoday activities are outsourced it is conditional to a dynamic
portfolio approach that enables bouwinvest to take advantage of the opportunities offered by shortterm
volatility and invest under attractive conditions compared to fairly illiquid unlisted real estate investments


dutch investments
residential fund open for institutional investors
pipeline secured by investments of more than  690 million


the residential fund generated a total return of 125 2014 51 with a direct return of 38 2014 39 and an
indirect return of 86 2014 12 the fund had a high and stable average occupancy rate of 976 likeforlike
rental growth for 2015 amounted to 38 2014 32 while rent arrears were low at 11 2014 12 the dividend
return for 2015 came in at 38 2014 39


the residential fund continued to reap the benefits of bouwinvests growth strategy and saw the completion and
delivery of eight excellent newbuild projects most of which were fully let before completion we currently have a
secured pipeline of 27 new residential projects following investments of around  466 million in 2015 these
investments will add 1712 apartments and 395 family homes we fully expect to benefit from the growing scarcity
of highquality residential units in the liberalised rental sector especially in our core markets giving us visibility
for the funds future and matching the funds regular longterm growth objectives


the recovery in the residential market and growing interest from domestic and international investors led once
again to a steady rise in values as house prices returned to precrisis levels in some areas due to high demand and
a lack of supply this helped us to book a positive indirect return in 2015 and we expect this to continue in the next
few years


the recovery in the residential sector and the very high quality of the residential portfolio enabled the fund to
attract three new investors in 2015


at yearend 2015 the funds property portfolio consisted of 216 properties with a total value of  30 billion

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                    23



retail fund open for institutional investors
twopillar strategy is starting to pay off


the retail fund booked a return of 45 in 2015 2014 18 the result of a direct return of 44 2014 45 and an
indirect return of 01 2014 27 the average occupancy rate was 942 2014 944 the dividend return for
2015 was 44 2014 45


the retail fund benefited from the continued economic recovery and a strong rise in consumer confidence which
was reflected in an increase in the values of its retail assets in amsterdam and elsewhere the fund once again
improved its portfolio through investments and upgrades of existing assets this reflects the funds commitment
to investing in assets with solid growth prospects throughout the crisis years while retail real estate will remain a
challenging sector in the years ahead we believe that our portfolio with a good balance of experience and
convenience oriented retail real estate assets will continue to generate solid returns in the long term


in 2015 the completed redevelopments were all in line with our strategic focus on the experience and
convenience segments of the retail rector the retail fund invested around  64 million in 2015 and intends to
upgrade and futureproof several existing assets reflecting our continued commitment to this segment of the real
estate market


on a very positive note the retail fund attracted its first three new investors who joined the fund as of 1 january
2016 this underlines investor faith in the retail sector and the trust bouwinvest has garnered on the real estate
investment market


in 2015 the retail fund agreed new leases and renewed existing contracts for a total of 38987 m² of space
representing a rental value of some  102 million


at the end of 2015 the funds portfolio consisted of 42 properties with a total value of  719 million


office fund open for institutional investors
package of 14 noncore office buildings sold following optimisation strategy


the office fund booked a return of 05 in 2015 2014 01 the result of a direct return of 42 2014 57 and a
negative indirect return of 37 2014 56 the average occupancy rate fell to 801 in 2015 from 899 in 2014
the dividend return came in at 42 2014 57 the negative indirect return was partly due to a strong
devaluation of the centrecourt office complex in the hague due to the potential vacation of this building by a
government ministry


after various year of outperformance last year was a year of consolidation and portfolio optimisation for the
office fund as this included the disposal of 14 office buildings we no longer considered core assets the fund
invested  27 million in an upgrade of the wtc complex in the hague and made preparations for the
redevelopment of the citroën buildings in amsterdam


the dutch office market will continue to be an extremely challenging sector but the highquality acquisitions in
prime locations the fund has made in recent years clearly demonstrate that there are still excellent opportunities
available the disposal of noncore assets enabled us to consolidate and optimise our portfolio taking the
proportion of the properties located in our core regions to 100 our longterm commitment to this real estate
sector means that we will continue to look for opportunities in the prime segment of the office market


one of the highlights of 2015 was the fact that the fund acquired its first thirdparty investor a french insurer
advised by amundi this demonstrates renewed investor confidence in the office sector and trust that
bouwinvests office fund is building a portfolio of offices that will withstand the test of time


active asset management and continued investment in upgrading and updating its office assets ensured that the
fund renewed or signed new leases for a total of 33965 m² representing an annual rental income of  42 million in
2015


at the end of 2015 the funds portfolio consisted of 16 properties with a total value of  478 million

healthcare fund on behalf of bpfbouw
two new acquisitions taken into operation in a very promising market


in its second year the healthcare fund reported a net result of  19 million while its total return amounted to
77 in 2015 the fund took two new assets into operation these were both in the premium assisted living
segment thereby creating a temporary imbalance with respect to the targeted distribution of segments however
the fund currently has several projects in the pipeline that will restore the balance in line with the 2018 targets


as healthcare moves from the state sector into the consumer market we expect the demand for better quality
services to increase substantially as people seek more value for money we are on the threshold of a new era
where one size fits all will no longer be the norm and consumers will require different levels of healthcare and
accommodation according to their lifestyles and needs


the ultimate potential for the entry of market forces into healthcare real estate in the netherlands is immense as
the floor space in the sector is projected to grow to 30 million m2 by 2030 in or roughly midway between the size of
the retail and office markets real estate brokers dtz and cbre estimate that annual investment transaction
volumes in the sector could hit between  650 million and  800 million over the next five years the bpfbouw
mandate to invest in healthcare real estate is  300 million for the coming years


hotel fund on behalf of bpfbouw
a year of promise

the hotel fund lifted profits to  115 million 2014  98 million the funds total return rose to 84 from 65 in
2014 highlights of the year include a turnkey purchase agreement for amsteltower hotel in amsterdam for this
hotel we have also signed a longterm lease 25 years with a fixed rent with tenant meininger completion of the
hotel is expected in the fourth quarter of 2017 and forward funding started in he fourth quarter of 2015


in addition the fund looked at a number of other opportunities two of which may turn into transactions


steady pressure in amsterdam supports the funds growth strategy amsterdam city centre is seeing a clear
increase in hotel rooms driven in particular by the opening of new highend hotels a number of leading notable
luxury hotel brands have opened recently or are set to do so in the near future despite the growing supply
occupancy rates and average room rates are expected to remain stable due to the increasing demand from
growing visitor numbers


bouwinvest development on behalf of bpfbouw
landholdings represent opportunities


bouwinvest development booked a positive return of 27 in 2015 compared with a negative return of 167 in
2014 the direct result came in at 49 2015 25 and the indirect result came in at 22 2014 142 mainly the
result of a significant depreciation of a landholding in nieuwvennep


the existing landholdings in the portfolio are once again increasing in importance the landholdings represent a
potential for 1750 new homes

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                    25




financial performance bouwinvest in 2015
income and costs
fee income came in at  305 million in 2015 93 higher than in 2014 combined with the overall management
costs of  254 million 2014  246 million we recorded a higher than expected margin of  51 million in 2015 up
55 compared to 2014 the total operating costs were higher than in 2014 due to the growth of the organisation
and e related personnel costs


fiscal result
deferred tax assets are less the calculated corporate taxes of  15 million for 2015 deferred tax assets are
recognised on the basis of losses from previous years that will be settled with the tax authorities


total result
the total result after taxes for 2015 came in at  44 million which is 181 above the average total profit of  36
million recorded in the last five years


financial position
as a result of the profit booked in 2015 shareholders equity increased to  272 million in 2015 from  294 million
in the previous year the solvency ratio was 89 2014 88


cash position
at yearend 2015 bouwinvest had a total of  168 million available in its current account with our bank abn amro
this was more than sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and was also in line with the formal requirements
of the alternative investment fund manager directive aifmd


profit allocation and dividend policy
the management proposes to pay out a dividend of  27 million in 2016



outlook
due to the desire for greater diversification in the overall real estate allocation to international investments the
target allocation will increase in the years ahead following last years shift in focus towards north america and
asia pacific the plan is to shift the portfolio towards an equal weighting in terms of regional allocation in the
longer term the performance of the total portfolio international investments is expected to be in line with the
long term target of 75 which is high compared to bonds and net initial yields on direct real estate investments
due to recovering asset values and jcurve effects in the existing portfolio the existing investments in all regions
are expected to generate these relatively high returns as a result of a combination of anticipated rental growth
and favourable financing costs in general cap rates are expected to remain in the low range as the historically
high spreads with government bond yields offer a cushion against rising interest rates the addition of listed real
estate contributes to an improvement of the overall riskreturn characteristics of the international portfolio


we expect most real estate markets to continue to grow in 2016 and we are generally positive on the outlook for
the growth of returns from our assets under management


in 2015 we once again reaped the benefits of our continued investment in the past few years  even during the
crisis years  and we believe we will continue to benefit from the strategic decisions we made in 2015 including
new residential and retail investments and the disposal of a package of office buildings we no longer considered
as core assets we have a positive outlook for the dutch real estate market and a very solid secured pipeline of new
properties of around  700 million this will generate even more interest and is expected to lead to new investors


the real estate sector is now a fullfledged alternative asset class with a proven track record of outperformance
when compared to fixed interest and stock investments more and more institutional investors are now increasing
their allocation to real estate as it provides solid and stable returns acts as a hedge on inflation and enables them
to diversify their investment portfolios real estate has the potential to make investment portfolios far more
resilient in the face of turbulent and volatile financial markets and the increasing demands of market regulators
of course this is likely to make the market far more competitive and more expensive certainly for topnotch
assets in the prime segments of our core regions on the other hand many investors are looking for an investment
manager with the right level of expertise and a solid track record in the real estate industry

we believe we fit that bill this is why we are seeing a great deal of interest from investors in our open funds in
just two years we have gone from zero to eleven thirdparty investors in these funds and we fully expect to
welcome many more in the years ahead this puts us in a very strong market position we have the funds the
commitment and the market knowhow to continue to expand our secured pipeline in 2016 and beyond to meet
this growing demand from dutch and international institutional investors

corporate social responsibility
introduction
bouwinvest believes it has a responsibility to make sure its investments meet sustainability criteria and that we
operate in a responsible and ethical manner we have always taken a longterm view and environmental social and
governance esg criteria play a significant role in our investment strategy this is because we are convinced that
sustainable and socially responsible investments and business operations play a key role in helping us to book
stable returns from our real estate investments


the effective integration of social environmental andor ethical considerations in our core business strategy and
operations helps us to create more value for our stakeholders and generate better riskadjusted financial returns

stakeholder engagement and management

affect those stakeholders either in shortterm or the longterm our stakeholders include shareholders investors
tenants business partners such as property managers international real estate managers and real estate
developers our employees regulatory bodies local authorities and society as a whole we make it our duty to
show our involvement with these parties and to take responsibility in the fields that our stakeholders find
important


the current environmental and social issues that are important to our stakeholders include good corporate
governance ethical behaviour a strong respect for human rights sustainable real estate and a good living
environment we pay close attention to these issues when making investments


bouwinvest believes that the best way to engage with its stakeholders is through open and transparent dialogue

funds and to ascertain what our stakeholders want and the issues they find relevant to them identifying these
issues in turn helps us to have a more positive impact reduce costs futureproof our organisation and ultimately
create value for all our stakeholders



csr pillars
our csr pillars
bouwinvest has divided its csr mission and activities into three pillars


1   we aim to be a reliable business partner and meet the expectations of our investors through full transparency
     on our csr track record and goals

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                   28



2   we endeavour to continuously improve the sustainability of our investment portfolio in cooperation with all
     our stakeholders
3   our goal is to be a flexible ethical and fair employer to help our people to achieve bouwinvests csr ambitions


sustainability strategy and material issues




sustainable and reliable business partner
bouwinvest sees sustainability as an integral part of its business and we believe that transparency on where and
how we impact society is a key element in improving our sustainability performance this transparency gives us
invaluable insight into the issues relevant to us and to our stakeholders and enables us to define clear priorities
and set concrete and measurable targets


we believe that the best way to ensure that our csr strategy is effective is to form sustainable longterm
partnerships with our business partners these organisations play a vital role in our daily operations and ensure
that our assets remain clean safe and vibrant places we set strict requirements for our thirdparty suppliers and
assess their performance regularly via bouwinvest customers we also forge longterm business partnerships with
other stakeholders such as our investors in which we protect the interests of our clients by conducting our
business in a transparent fair and ethical manner avoiding all forms of corruption and unethical conduct while
providing stable and sustainable returns on their investments


see the corporate governance section in this report for more details


sustainable real estate
bouwinvest is constantly improving the transparency and sustainability performance of its three main sector
funds both at a bricks and mortar level and at fund level we use globally accepted performance indicators inrev
gri and sustainability labels gresb breeam to benchmark our performance and our progress however it is
impossible to achieve real sustainability by yourself


see the csr sections of the fund annual reports for more details


benchmark international real estate investments
last year bouwinvest also continued its active cooperation with other institutional investors aimed at increasing
sustainability and transparency in the real estate sector we extended our membership of gresb and encouraged
fund managers of our international indirect investments to participate in the gresb benchmark


in 2015 we assessed the effectiveness of our responsible investment property policy we received valuable input
from our international real estate investments to evaluate and further enhance our policy and increased our
understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the real estate sector regarding responsible property
investment

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                  29



the results of the gresb benchmark once improved in 2015 despite a slight drop in response rate in the yearly
assessment



   highlights gresb and international portfolio

         the number of investors participating in the gresb benchmark dropped slightly to 65 from 68
          measured by nav
         the number of green stars increased to 18 from 15 unlisted investments and rose to 21 from 18 for
          listed investments this means that the number of green stars overall has more than doubled
          since benchmarking started
          the international portfolio outperformed the benchmark with an average total score of 59 compared
          with a global average of 55
         the score increased considerably throughout the portfolio for the unlisted investments 91
          improved their score compared to last year in 2014 43 for the listed investments the increase was
          also impressive 78  following an increase of 54 in 2014
         the unlisted investments participating in gresb delivered a 3 overall decrease in energy
          consumption 80531 mwh and a 3 overall decrease in ghg emissions 18841 tonnes



sustainability performance is one of our key criteria in investment decisions and risk assessment and we give a
clear preference to investments with higher sustainability scores the inclusion of the corruption index per
country and the robecosam country sustainability index in our internal bouwinvest global market monitor also
enables us to assess and manage esg risks even more effectively when selecting our international investments


for more details please see the csr sections in our fund reports and the csr performance indicators in this annual
report


a sustainable ethical and fair employer
bouwinvest sees its employees as its most valuable resource and its most important source of value creation our
hr policy is aimed at providing our employees with the knowledge expertise and skills they need so they can
develop their talents expand their skill sets and help create a pleasant and stimulating working environment the
results of last years employee engagement surveys show that this approach is working for the past three years
bouwinvest has booked a steady improvement in what we see as a one of the main spearheads of our hr policy no
less than 955 of our employees responded to the 2015 survey which is more than 15 more than the benchmark
of 805 for financial institutions and way above the national average of 708 this demonstrates a remarkably
high level of engagement on the part of our employees this was confirmed by another rise in our employee
engagement score to 80 compared with 78 in the 2013 survey


for more details please see the hrm section in this report



progress made in 2015
in 2015 bouwinvest took a number of significant steps to further integrate corporate social responsibility into its
daytoday business the pillars of our csr strategy are our aim to be a reliable business partner to increase the
sustainability of our real estate investments in cooperation with our stakeholders and our goal to be an ethical
and fair employer the shift to a more refined set of csr pillars signals a step forward in our journey of linking
financial and sustainability ambitions and strategy to create longterm stakeholder value


dutch real estate funds win green star status
bouwinvest uses the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb to measure and compare the
sustainability performance of our three main dutch sector funds in 2015 bouwinvests three main dutch sector
funds once again actively participated in this initiative which is aimed at boosting transparency and sustainability
in the real estate sector thanks to this strategy and the actions that bouwinvest continued to make in 2015
bouwinvests residential office and retail funds were awarded green star status for the second year in a row
green star is the highest possible category in the gresb rankings and we will be doing our utmost to retain this
status in 2016 and beyond

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                   30



sustainability hotspots
bouwinvest is currently working on a materiality matrix to help the company identify the main sustainability
issues and devise a strategy to deal with them on an ongoing basis this is important because sustainability is
about a lot more than the environment and reducing emissions real sustainability also embraces ethical legal
social compliance risk and human resources issues

in todays ever more demanding environment a csr strategy has to address all these issues to create sustainable
value for an organisations stakeholders the materiality matrix will help us to further boost awareness of how
important it is for us to embed esg criteria in our daytoday business and help us to refine our priorities and
targets it will also act as a starting point for further engagement with several relevant stakeholder groups in 2016


co2 footprint bouwinvest organisation
in 2012 bouwinvest started to improve the transparency of the management organisations co2 emissions a year
later we expressed our ambition to make our operations carbon neutral by 2020 we have already made significant
progress in reducing our emissions in recent years and we took further steps to reduce emissions in 2015 progress
made this year include


      electricity consumption in our head office fell by another 9 in 2015 totalling a reduction of 37 since the
       start of active energy management in 2010
      emissions from our waste disposal fell by 11
      the use of more fuelefficient lease cars including hybrid and electric lease cars resulted in a reduction in
       co2 emissions of more than 2 while the number of kilometres driven increased by 4
      a sideeffect of an increase in our international real estate allocation was a 14 increase in co2 emissions
       from air travel


these and other measures led to a total reduction in our total co2 emissions of 06 compared to the previous year
carbon emissions intensity calculated as tonnes of co2 fte dropped by 29 in addition bouwinvest purchases
renewable energy electricity for its entire real estate portfolio this is part of bouwinvests policy to reduce any
negative impact on the environment and stimulate the use of sustainable sources of energy

residential fund and construction partner dura vermeer signed a contract for the construction and purchase of
200 homes in the rijswijk buiten residential development close to the cities of rijswijk the hague and delft all
the homes will be in the liberalised midrental segment and come complete with stateoftheart climate control
systems the homes will be fitted with solar panels thermal energy systems and efficient ventilation installations

green building certificates
the design for the redevelopment of the retail complex damrak 70 and 80 in amsterdam was awarded the breeam
nl new build and renovation very good certificate at yearend 2015 the design team worked with a breeam nl
expert to incorporate a host of sustainability measures in the design the roof has been fitted with solar panels
and the building has been fitted with led lighting the designers also opted for energyefficient escalators and
lifts while virtually all the existing construction was either reused or incorporated in the design the
redevelopment also complied with the bewuste bouwers sustainable construction code which includes standards
for minimising and separating waste the reduction of energy and water use safety and the prevention of nuisance
in the immediate environment the plan is to continue this initiative by working with tenants to introduce a broad
range of measures for the fitout and use of the retail premises with the ultimate aim of a breeam nl very good
certificate once the renovation is complete and the tenants have moved into the complex this is expected at
yearend 2016

the office fund worked very closely with fair trade organisation max havelaar and microcredit provider
oikocredit on the renovation and refitting of its arthur van schendelstraat building in utrecht with the aim of
creating truly sustainable office suites when max havelaar and oikocredit approached bouwinvest they had very
clear demands regarding their future office space as they wanted it to be a clear extension of the culture working
environment and identity of the two idealistic organisations

they wanted pleasant lighting a healthy interior climate and they wanted to be close to utrecht central station
arthur van schendelstraat fit the bill perfectly and the office fund and its future tenants set to work  in
partnership  to put together a package of measures that would create offices that will meet sustainability
standards long into the future these measures included solar panels a wide range of energy efficiency measures
and the use of sustainable materials for the renovation this has already helped improve the energy label for the
building to b from d and further improvement is expected bouwinvest has also applied for a breeam nl inuse
certificate and expects to obtain this in 2016 the improvements in the sustainability of the office building
have led to a great deal of interest from likeminded organisations in the nonprofit sector the fund is currently in
negotiations on a number of leases

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                33




human resources management

human resources managements primary goal is to ensure that bouwinvest has the personnel it needs to achieve
its goals organised in a manner that facilitates those goals strategic personnel planning and succession planning
are key factors in the hr planning cycle the results of this planning include a personnel development scheme and
mobility plans from internal moves to hiring and retention the annual cycle of work planning is a cascade from
fund and business plans to department targets to individual plans and evaluation cycles more than ever change is
the one constant factor for this reason organisational changes are aimed at increasing flexibility at various
levels across the organisation as a whole within departments and individual jobs to achieve this bouwinvest
focusses on processes rather than hierarchy empowering personnel is essential to success changes in everyday
workplaces are demanding and the input of each individual employee is needed if bouwinvest is to move forward
while staying firmly in control something that is a major requirement of our investors and regulators the dutch
central bank and the dutch financial markets authority information and knowledgesharing throughout the
company is essential which requires constant investment in facilitating it systems and exploring the expanding
uses for information security awareness training has become an integral part of every it training course and the
annual compliance training scheme


hrm highlights in 2015
hr cycle
the annual hr cycle confirmed that bouwinvest has a futureproof employee base and that key positions all have
secured shortterm replacements we also identified growth potential during the midyear reviews we matched
individual ambitions with company needs the main ensuing initiatives were aimed at jobrelated development
and talent management which bouwinvest offers in the form of a potential program as well as via company
opportunities in internal projects the awareness of potential and ambitions also increases internal mobility
which combined with development opportunities is an important driver of employee satisfaction


it and information
this year we launched the document management system to facilitate companywide information sharing while
at the same time ensuring a higher standard of digital document management the system has many features and
requires a different approach to documents and digital archives introducing the entire company to the system
will take another year and realising its full potential possibly another two years


operational excellence and integrity
each year management announces one or two central themes that departments and individual employees are
then expected to translate to their own practices in 2015 the themes were operational excellence and integrity


the operational excellence theme led to an impressive variety of initiatives throughout the company from
costefficiency measures related to existing business contracts to revised internal cooperative agreements and
innovative exploratory initiatives integrity once again proved to be an integral part of the company dna
departments easily formulated suitable requirements and enthusiastically participated in the compliance
dilemma training


innovation
bouwinvest means to instigate real change by putting its people in charge delegating responsibilities to the
lowest possible level will achieve this at individual job level taking one step further we are trying to extend
employee participation right into business management paving the way for fresh views and innovative ideas
colleagues from various departments and hierarchical levels are invited to join in projects involving process
design revising or designing internal regulations or selecting and implementing new it applications last year hr
invited our young professionals organised in young bouwinvest to explore future work trends and draft success
factors for hrm in the near future all these initiatives were warmly accepted and led to the formation of an
innovation lab to promote and enable the exploration of innovative ideas throughout the organisation
innovation will be one of the central themes for 2016

collaboration is vital
the real estate investment sector is a people business it depends completely on knowhow and expertise and
achieving commercial focus requires very high levels of collaboration and knowledge exchange right across the
organisation this will be one of the major drivers of change at bouwinvest in the years ahead collaboration is
already implicit in almost everything we do but in the future it will be a very explicit and integral part of how we
do business


to promote collaboration we introduced an openplan office literally breaking down barriers and bringing people
from different parts of the organisation closer together this effort was boosted by the flex working practices we
introduced such as the absence of fixed work stations for a large number of our employees


communicating change
communication is a key factor in the promotion of collaboration and bouwinvest has stepped up its internal
communications in several ways we now make maximum use of internal media such as our group intranet and
various inhouse newsletters increasing the number of internal news items and project writeups people are now
much more aware of what is happening in other parts of the organisation


putting people first
our people and their knowhow their commitment and their engagement are essential to our continued success
this is why bouwinvest places so much focus on its peoples professional and personal development we want our
people to be committed and accept accountability for their results but commitment and accountability
are twoway streets we cannot expect people to be engaged unless we as an organisation show similar levels of
engagement we provide our people with the tools they need and create a culture in which they can focus on what
they need to do


respect people have fun and make money
we invest both time and money in the development of professional and personal skills to create project
challenges and also to promote an active vitality programme with a range of individual sports activities and
collective events in addition to our commercial success we feel that this engagement has also helped us to
achieve one of the lowest absenteeism rates in the real estate industry and indeed in the dutch corporate world


we also organise regular social and networking events for the entire organisation these have increased the
opportunities for internal networking and helped create a much more cohesive organisation with fewer barriers
in communications across the company besides this the social events give people a chance to get to know each
other in an even more relaxed atmosphere


investing in the future
we want to continue to improve as an organisation with the people we have on board and we want them to grow
with us we already have strategic personal planning and succession planning in place and in 2013 we introduced
the management development programme covering a wide range of management skills the 2014 launch of the
development programme for team leaders and high potentials was the next logical step in the process we
continued to roll this out in 2015 paving the way for the next generation of leaders we also conducted our
biannual employee engagement survey which shows us when our employees think we are on the right track and
identify improvements to make us even more effective

last years survey showed that we are indeed on the right track as we recorded a score of 80 comparted with 78
in the 2013 survey


accepting social responsibility
bouwinvest does not exist in a vacuum and we aim to play an active and positive role in the world around us we
actively promote the regeneration of neighbourhoods in inner city areas across the netherlands both at head
office level and through our investment funds and encourage our people to get involved in social initiatives


on a real bricks and mortar level bouwinvest once again extended its partnership with the homeplan charity
foundation which builds houses for some of the worlds poorest people for an initial period of three years
bouwinvest will make a fixed donation to the charitys housing projects but we have also committed to getting
our own people involved in initiatives around the globe in october of last year two bouwinvest employees spent
time in south africa with a homeplan team building homes in the slums of pomeroy in the countrys kwazulu
natalsan province four families had new homes in time for christmas

risk management
risk management and compliance
bouwinvest recognises the importance of a solid risk management framework the aim of the framework is to
identify and mitigate risks making it possible for the company to achieve its goals more effectively


the developments of the past few years in the financial sector and among asset managers have led to calls for
stricter legislation and regulations to prevent a repeat of the various crises the banking insurance and pension
sectors still face increasing regulation and monitoring by regulatory authorities as a consequence institutional
investors attach ever increasing importance to internal risk management compliance transparency and open
accountability to stakeholders


the various cases of major real estate fraud seen in the past have led to a rethink in the sector apart from stricter
legislation and stakeholders that have forced the sector to take action real estate players have realised that this
kind of behaviour simply cannot be tolerated due in part to new legislation and the sectors need for internal
reform real estate asset managers are continuously improving risk management compliance and internal
auditing practices to prevent future incidents the real estate world is changing rapidly and players in the sector
are  wherever possible  making use of lessons from the banking and insurance worlds



risk management framework
bouwinvest recognises the importance of a solid risk management framework the aim of the framework is to
identify and mitigate risks making it possible for the company to achieve its goals more effectively


bouwinvest has chosen the globally recognised coso framework as the basis for its own risk management this
model goes beyond internal controls and also covers the entire internal management system and is known as
coso or enterprise risk management framework ermf based on this framework bouwinvest has also drawn up
its own reporting and monitoring framework with its four lines of defence as described in the corporate
governance section in this annual report



main risks and mitigating factors
in 2015 bouwinvest recognised the following management risks


      continuity
      integrity and compliance
      quality
      legal
      fiscal


continuity
the continuity risk is the risk relating to the continuity of the management organisation as a result of which the
company can no longer meet the terms of its agreements with bpfbouw and other clients this risk is mitigated by
closing service level agreements with outsourcing partners by drawing up and maintaining a business continuity
plan and by the application of an information security policy


integrity and compliance
integrity and compliance risk covers risks related to the failure to comply with laws regulations or transparency
requirements by either bouwinvest any member of the bouwinvest organisation or by any party with whom
bouwinvest is conducting business this risk is primarily mitigated by having a clearly articulated governance
structure and by providing bouwinvest employees with a clear set of rules of conduct on top of that several
procedures stipulate certain compliance activities to minimise the risk of integrity issues for bouwinvest or any of
its investors

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2015                                                     41



quality
the quality risk is the risk that the management organisation is unable to deliver sufficient quality as a result of
which bouwinvest is unable to meet the terms of its agreements with bpfbouw and other investors in an
adequate fashion this risk is mitigated through the use of an internal process management framework in
accordance with isae 3402 which is tested annually by an external auditor in addition to this a corporate social
responsibility action list is monitored and a business incidents procedure is in place


legal
as an investment manager bouwinvest and its subsidiaries engage in a wide array of contracts and legal
obligations legal risk is the risk that an external party holds bouwinvest liable for compensation for damages that
bouwinvest or a related party may have caused to prevent any of these legal liabilities the bouwinvest legal
department is involved in due diligence for commitments made by bouwinvest or any of its subsidiaries if
necessary external council is brought in for highly specialised knowledge or for litigation purposes


fiscal
in a capitalintensive sector like real estate investment tax is an important part of investment decisions in
conducting business there is always a risk of paying either too much or too little tax both but especially the latter
can have considerable financial and legal consequences guided by our tax manager and international tax lawyers
bouwinvest optimises its activities fiscally to avoid overtaxation while staying well within legal boundaries



control of investment decisions
the investment committee ic is an important advisory body for the board of directors in terms of risk
management supported by the risk controller the manager corporate control participates in the ic and tests the
investment process decisionmaking and investment proposals he does so together with the compliance officer
and several other bouwinvest specialists investment proposals are tested in advance against kpis the
fundamentals of which are set annually in the investment plan this includes looking at whether the investments
are in line with the budgeted amounts of the various locations and whether the risk classification is correct and in
line with the intended investment strategy and the goals for portfolio diversification


after the ic has provided its advice the proposal is presented to the board of directors the board will take the ic
advice into consideration and makes the final decision for investments above a certain threshold an additional
approval by the supervisory board is required using leverage is a wellknown risk factor in the real estate world
unlike many other real estate investors bouwinvest makes no use of leverage for dutch investments
bouwinvests international investments do involve leverage but this accounts for a limited proportion of total
investments and is continuously monitored in financial and risk reports


in addition to leverage extra risk factors in dutch and international investments include business partners
related due diligence and fiscal matters all of these are monitored closely by the risk and compliance functions in
the case of international investments bouwinvest devotes extra attention to fee structures and their relation to a
funds performance



alternative investment fund managers directive
aifmd
in early 2014 bouwinvest was one of the first parties in the netherlands to obtain an afm licence as required by
the aifmd this licence allows bouwinvest to manage funds that are open for other institutional investors besides
bpfbouw


the aifmd specifies certain transparency and integrityrelated requirements for alternative investment funds in
2015 bouwinvest further optimised its reporting processes in addition to this bouwinvest streamlined its
cooperation with depositary intertrust bouwinvest foresees no aifmdrelated challenges for 2016

monitoring and reporting
within the different activities of bouwinvest a wide array of risks is continuously monitored by the board of
directors to support this monitoring and to optimise risk transparency quarterly risk reports are produced by the
risk controller in 2015 there were three types of quarterly risk reporting


      risk report for portfolio bpfbouw
      risk report as part of fund reports for aif funds
      business incident reports


both the portfolio bpfbouw and the fund risk report have been revised in 2015 revision has focused on clarifying
and compacting information regarding risks on both aggregation levels on top of that the reporting on
bpfbouws portfolio has been tailored to the risks that are identified in the pension funds risk charter the format
of business incident reporting remained unchanged in 2015

reporting of performance indicators
bouwinvest reports environmental data of those assets where there is management control possible operational
control approach data is provided for those assets where we have authority to introduce and implement
operating policies and are responsible for purchasing energy and water and handling waste our management
control differs greatly by asset type eg residential and office these differences affect the level of influence we
have over the sustainability performance of our assets


like for like data and changes represents assets which have been fully owned and operational for the full 24 month
period in our investment portfolio it provides insight in the performance of an indicator over time at a constant
portfolio scope the reduction in ghg emissions can be explained by the compensation of carbon emissions
through purchase of carbon certificates this follows the commitment of bouwinvest to reduce the impact its
operations has on climate change


energy emission and water intensities are reported using shared services as the numerator and lettable floor
area lfa as the denominator shared services refer to landlordobtained consumption for common parts and
any services provided to tenant areas that have not been submetered
