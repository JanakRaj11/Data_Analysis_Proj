interview with the ceo




 dr mastiaux you have taken on the role of       does this mean that the energy world of
ceo at enbw at a time when the whole energy        tomorrow will be completely different from

centre of intense public debate  more so now      many energy companies until recently the
than ever before  thereby reflecting a radical    industrys value added chain was defined as
change in our energy landscape this change        starting with generation and oriented towards
is characterised by the rapid transition from       distribution and sales market power was
nuclear and conventional energy generation           based on ownership of generation c apacities
to renewable energies in germany today we          and grids the flow along the value added
have around 450 central power stations but           chain will change direction in future only
the number of local generation facilities is         those companies that consistently take into
13 million this illustrates the changes in the     account all business activities from a customer
generation structure the market environment
has also continued to change new market par
ticipants are trying to establish themselves
thereby increasing competitiveness as well as
the demands placed on grid management we
are also seeing significant changes in customer
expectations and behaviour this is accompa

tomers wishes and expectations will be able to    becomes more and more intense we must of
defend their position or to put it more simply   course also reduce complexity at the company
in the future we must change our perspective       and streamline our processes considerably
and start with the customer then going back       and make them more efficient on this basis

this you have been in office since october         mance on the one hand and empathy on the
2012 what impressions have you gathered so
far at enbw

frank mastiaux enbw is a company with
many strengths and competencies of a tra
ditional major utility particularly worthy
of mention in my opinion are the techni
cal competences and experience in all areas
enbw understands energy furthermore the
operation of technical facilities and planning
of activities are done conservatively in the
positive sense of the word and with a focus on
safety the company also keeps clear focus on
forwardlooking issues employees identifica
tion with their tasks is high as is the mutual
loyalty of company and employees the social
partnership in our company works tradition
ally well enbws regional roots and presence
are strong



 that was the positive where does action
need to be taken

frank mastiaux we need to review enbws           in the medium to long term enbw aims
current value added chain its income from
                                                     to emerge as the first energy company
conventional and nuclear energy generation
is falling rapidly  this was the case in 2012       on the market with a consistent focus on
and will also pose a problem in 2013 and             the customer
subsequent years the gas segment still
 needs to reach its potential with regard to
 our generation capacities from renewable
 energies we need to reach a critical mass in
 the short to medium term d  istribution grids   other form the main c ornerstones in this
 are under pressure as a result of tendencies      regard we must also work considerably on our
 towards moving back to municipal owner           perception by outsiders our customers see
 ship our investment portfolio could also be     us as large and powerful we need to change
 improved further we are working intensely on     this and be seen as a partner at eye level by
 sharpening our corporate strategy which will   increasingour openness to dialogue




                                                                                                       _5

                                                  sounds promising what does it involve
                                                 exactly

                                                 frank mastiaux enbw 2020 is divided into
                                                 three clearly defined phases in a first step
                                                 which will take up the next two years or so we
                                                 will set up the right platform we will develop
                                                 a new forwardlooking business model with
                                                 customer orientation and innovation at its
                                                  core we will review our business portfolio
                                                  based on demanding performance criteria
                                                  we will also adjust our processes structures
                                                  and organisation accordingly

                                                 in the second phase  towards the middle of
                                                 the decade  we aim to achieve our full poten
                                                 tial with the growth areas generating increas
 how will you approach these issues            ing contributions to earnings the entire enbw
                                                 team operating in highperformance mode
 frank mastiaux four success factors are key   and enbw being seen as an ideal partner for
efficiency in organisation and in processes     all energy issues
consistent customer orientation high inno
vation and an affinity for partnerships and      in the years running up to 2020 we aim to
dialogue in the medium to long term enbw      become one of the leading providers on the
 aims to emerge as the first energy company      market for targeted customer segments and
 with a consistent focus on the customer        special energy ecosystems with our whole
                                                 range of products and services the result
this requires changes and these wont happen     will be an enbw that is successful due to its
overnight but we have already made the first    fresh approach to energy and its focus on the
steps and set up an overall programme which      customer
will systematically help bring us to our goal
in clearly structured steps this programme
is called enbw 2020                            you talk of developing the right platform
                                                 could you be more specific

we are currently preparing a detailed profile    doing this even more intensely in future on
of our strengths and weaknesses for each field   the basis of objective criteria
and linking it to market requirements as our
limited resources mean we cannot offer every    dr mastiaux thank you for the informative chat
thing for anyone anywhere we will have to
make decisions as to which markets and fields
we want enbw to operate in in future build

energy industry we will concentrate on the
areas where we can present our customers
with attractive and unique offers to stand out
from the competition in germany as well as
europe in this regard we also see some growth
opportunities beyond germany  after all a
holistic approach geared to climatecompat

proactive and based on partnership
our course for the future of energy
enbw has set itself clear targets of actively shaping the new energy concept and meeting the require

moves we will secure our position as a lowcarbon generator and expand the range of local energy
solutions for our customers


actively shaping                             germany over the period until 2020            develop new public participation models

lowcarbon and climatecompatible energy

we are gradually converting our generation portfolio to maintain supply reliability the objective is to
manage our company in both a viable and a sustainable manner through the expansion of renewable
energies we want to further reinforce our leading position as lowcarbon generator and thereby keep
emissions to a low level


we are focusing on the expansion of wind
                                                01
and hydroelectric power but we will also
continue to invest in photovoltaic gen
eration and bioenergy hydroelectric
power already accounts for over 10 of
our electricity generation today we are
expanding capacity at existing power sta
tions as in iffezheim for example and
plan to develop further sites for wind and
hydroelectric power in germany and
turkey for instance

we are continuously expanding our wind
energy capacities badenwürttemberg
in particular is set to become host to a
considerable number of the new onshore
wind turbines being built which is why
more than 160 locations with potential for
500 turbines are currently being exam
ined we have already secured plots of
land for 18 new wind farms offshore our

   roughly at the same level nevertheless the specific co2

explanation of selected indicators                              carbon footprint and conventional air pollutants
                                                                direct co2 emissions are mainly determined by the usage of
to compensate for nuclear energy electricity generation        fossilfuelled power stations accordingly the increase in
from renewable energies was expanded compared to 2011           fossilfuelled electricity generation is the reason for the rise
while maintaining enbws own generation capacity at the         in direct co2 emissions from 187 to 206 million t co2eq
same level and more power stations with fossil energy
sources were used                                              the increase in indirect co2 emissions is attributable to grid
                                                                losses involving higher energy flows in the transmission and
fuels byproducts and other consumables                        distribution grids
the increased use of fossilfuelled energy generation
facilities compared to 2011 is the reason underlying the rise   due to the lower electricity production from nuclear
in generationrelated materials flows such as fuels by       energy avoided co2 emissions decreased from 313 to
products and other consumables                                 296 million t co2eq

the decrease in the use of natural gas as a fuel by             the rise both in the absolute volume of sulphur dioxide and
approximately 30 is attributable to the lower electricity      nitrogen oxides and in the specific emissions is directly
production by gasfired power stations in 2012                 attributable to substituting nuclear energy with electricity
                                                                generated from coal
the use of nuclear fuels increased in 2012 compared to 2011
this was not a continuous development but followed set         use of water
cycles in 2011 the nuclear refuelling volume was relatively   the lower level of electricity generated from nuclear energy

customary level of 40 t                                        purposes this is reflected in the lower figures for
                                                                surfaceriver water drawn and cooling water discharge
waste
a total of 865138 t of conventional waste was produced in      environmental protection expenditure
2012 up 6 on the prior year this is primarily due to         in 2012 capital expenditures for environmental
increased construction activity at the equity investments       protection dropped from  262 million to  180 million
and the new generating facilities commissioned                 this is principally due to lower investment in the
                                                                rheinfelden and iffezheim hydroelectric power station
the percentage of recycled waste improved to 879 the         projects in line with the advanced degree of completion
share of nonhazardous and hazardous waste that was             and lower expenditure on the enbw baltic 2 offshore wind
