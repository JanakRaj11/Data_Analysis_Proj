                                         which involves achieving zero net carbon
                                         emissions by balancing the amount
                                         of carbon released with an equivalent

  unfortunately despite the best efforts of abitibibowater
  and other producers not all the volume of old

  the problem lies with the singlestream collection
  methods used in many cities as a result of being
  compacted and comingled with other commodities
  during collection and transport some of the onp
  becomes contaminated to the point where it can
  no longer be recycled into new paper grades
