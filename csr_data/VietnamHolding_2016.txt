the ongoing actions to increase the foreign ownership limits on
shares of public companies are likely to become a catalyst for vietnams
graduation from frontier to emerging market status in the msci indices
this is in fact one of the governments stated objectives previous cases
of countries ascending to the emerging stock market status have resulted
in increased inward flows of foreign indirect investments which in turn
helped companies to raise the additional capital needed to support
higher growth

                                                                                                          vietnam holding annual report 2015




2   principal accounting policies continued
    ii recognition
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially on the trade date which is the date
    that the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument other financial assets and liabilities are
    recognised on the date they are originated

    financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value with transaction
    costs recognised in profit or loss financial assets or financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss are recognised
    initially at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue

    iii derecognition
    a financial asset is derecognised when the company no longer has control over the contractual rights that
    comprise that asset this occurs when the rights are realised expire or are surrendered

    financial assets that are sold are derecognised and the corresponding receivables from the buyer for the payment are
    recognised on the trade date being the date the company commits to sell the assets

    a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged cancelled or expired

    iv measurement
     fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants at the measurement date in the principal or in its absence the most advantageous market to which the
    company has access at that date the fair value of a liability reflects its nonperformance risk

    when available the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that
    instrument a market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and
    volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis the company measures instruments quoted in an active market at
    last traded price

    if there is no quoted price in an active market then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant
    observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs the chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors
    that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction

    the company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which
    the change has occurred

    as at 30 june 2015 31 2014 12 of the valuations of the net assets of the company were based on quotes obtained from
    brokers

    any increases or decreases in values are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an unrealised gain or loss

    v gains and losses on subsequent measurement
    gains and losses arising from a change in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income

    vi impairment
    financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there
    is objective evidence of impairment if any such indication exists an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
    flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate




                                                                                                                                           31

2    principal accounting policies continued
     if in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases
     and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the writedown the impairment is reversed through the
     statement of comprehensive income

     vii cash and cash equivalents
     cash comprises current deposits with banks and fixed deposits cash equivalents are shortterm highly liquid investments that
     are readily convertible to known amounts of cash are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the
     purpose of meeting shortterm cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes

f offsetting
    financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when the
    company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the transactions are intended to be settled on a
    net basis or simultaneously eg through a market clearing mechanism

g amounts due tofrom brokers
    amounts due tofrom brokers represent security purchases and sales transactions which are contracted for but not yet
    delivered at the end of the accounting period

h share capital
    ordinary shares
    ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as
    a deduction from equity net of any tax effect

     repurchase disposal and reissue of share capital treasury shares
     when share capital recognised as equity is repurchased the amount of the consideration paid which includes directly
     attributable costs net of any tax effects is recognised as a deduction from equity repurchased shares are classified as treasury
     shares and are presented in the reserve for own share account when treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently the
     amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in
     nondistributable capital reserve

     i taxation
     tax expense comprises current and deferred tax current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the
     extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income

     current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or
     substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years

     deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
     financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes the measurement of deferred taxes reflects the
     tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the company expects at the end of the reporting period to recover
     or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be
     applied to temporary differences when they reverse based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
     reporting date

     deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and
     they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity

                                                                                                         vietnam holding annual report 2015




2     principal accounting policies continued
      a deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it
      is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at
      each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised

      in determining the amount of current and deferred tax the company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions
      and whether additional taxes and interest may be due the company believes that

      its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors including
      interpretations of tax law and prior experience this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series
      of judgements about future events new information may become available that causes the company to change its judgement
      regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such
      a determination is made

      at present no income profit capital or capital gain taxes are levied in the cayman islands and accordingly no provision for
      such taxes has been recorded by the company in the accompanying financial statements in the event that such taxes are
      levied the company has received an undertaking from the governor in cabinet of the cayman islands exempting it from all
      such taxes for a period of twenty years from 2 may 2006

      basis of yield to redemption from the date of purchase

k dividend income
    dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date on which the right to receive payment is established for quoted
    equity securities this is usually the exdividend date for unquoted equity securities this is usually the date on which the
    shareholders approve the payment of a dividend dividend income from equity securities designated as at fair value through
    profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss in a separate line item

l   fee and commission expense

3    financial instruments and associated risks

     predominately exposed to market risk within its securities purchased in the vietnamese market

     the companys investments in securities are exposed to market risk and are disclosed by the following generic investment
     types
                                                                                            2015                               2014

     usd6037732 2014 usd5926311 a 5 increase in market value would have led to an equal and opposite effect on nav and
     profit or loss

     the company may invest in financial instruments and enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional
     currency consequently the company is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other currencies may
     change and have an adverse effect on the value of the companys assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than usd

     and foreign currency environment is continuously monitored by the investment manager and reviewed by the board at least
     once each quarter

    the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined
    based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety assessing whether an input
    is significant requires judgement including consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability moreover if a fair value
    measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs that fair value
    measurement is a level 3 measurement

    although the company believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate the use of different assumptions could lead to
    different measurements of fair value for fair value measurements in level 3 if the reasonable possible alternative assumptions
