                                      is integral to the success
                                      that the charity wcmc
                                      has achieved




                                      wcmc grew in 2013 building on previous successful years
                                      we place the highest value on our collaboration with unep
                                      and we understand the value that unep places on its work
                                      with wcmc we supported uneps mandates across a range of
                                      projects and we continued to enjoy excellent relations in our
              we want our support    joint steering committee meetings

                                      major successes of the year in 2014 we will continue our
                                      strategic efforts to build on this success attracting new partners
                                      and investing in other leading edge systems to support decision
                                      makers
                                          such success welcome of course for its own sake also
                                      demands that we ask questions about how to achieve most
                                      through our partnership with unep we have embarked on
                                      a focused exploration of the impacts of our work and how
                                      we measure them although measurement will not be easily
                                      achieved this is a worthwhile quest as we set our sights on
                                      future goals and work more directly to position biodiversity at
                                      the heart of decisionmaking
                                          we know that our staff enjoy their work and the success that
                                      their efforts bring it is my pleasure here to express the boards
                                      sincere appreciation to all our staff they demonstrate huge
                                      commitment to their work  without them none of this would

                                 one of my main hopes for 2013 was that we would

                                 very happy to be able to report that this is precisely what we
      im hugely grateful for   achieved
     the outstanding level of        during the year we not only expanded our project activities
                                 but also managed to invest a great deal of time in the process of
  support we receive from the
                                 developing the new unep programme of work this involved
  unep divisions and for the     the team taking a leading role in the development of several
     unstinting efforts of our   important project documents where hitherto we had only
        wcmc counterparts       played a supporting role
                                     this report highlights a number of the results we delivered
                                 in 2013 to showcase the diversity of our collaboration with unep
                                 colleagues friends in the biodiversityrelated conventions and
                                 partners in governments nongovernmental organizations
                                 and the private sector i am hugely grateful for the outstanding
                                 level of support we receive from the unep divisions and for the
                                 unstinting efforts of our wcmc counterparts whose scientific
                                 and technical expertise make our work possible
                                     our achievements in 2013 coupled with our ever increasing
                                 integration into the unep programme of work should make
                                 it possible for us to explore mechanisms for delivering more
                                 services at the regional and national levels in 2014 hopefully i
                                 will be able to report considerable progress in this direction the

     improving quality
     performance and
     impact
     as a service provider unepwcmcs
     reputation and partner relationships
     are critical to our ongoing success
     we are judged on the quality of our work and we are expected to deliver
     timely products that are scientifically rigorous accurate and impartial in
     a form that is useful to decision makers

     quality
     following a wide review of our current practices we have established a
     set of quality standards for all our products and services we have also
     developed an internal reporting and disclosure system that will enable
     us to track our adherence to these standards particularly important
     areas in assuring quality are peer review at several stages of product
     development including early planning and final publication external
     feedback and maintenance of sufficient supporting information for
     others to query or replicate any aspects of our work

     performance and impact
     other areas of our performance also require monitoring our existing
     key performance indicators shown on pages 6 and 7 of this report help
     us to keep on top of some of these but by no means all during 2013
     with help from a team of mphil conservation leadership students from
     the judge business school in cambridge we identified a number of
     areas for improvement these included the need for a greater breadth
     of feedback from partners and clients and a focus on the results of our
     capacity development work which is one of the pillars of our strategy
     and an emerging focus for 2014
         these areas are important for increasing our impact and achieving
     better performance to take them forward in 2013 we created two
     new posts the head of impact strategy is exploring what and
     where unepwcmcs impact has been and what we should strive
     for in coming years the head of capacity development is taking
     responsibility for developing a longerterm resultsoriented approach
     to capacity development particularly in our work supporting
     national government partners the creation of these two new posts

carbon offsetting
the centre has been running a carbon offsetting scheme since 2010 which
compensates for 100 per cent of the emissions resulting from the centres
air travel and building emissions in 2013 a total sum of 6052 was
allocated to the offsetting scheme funds to offset building emissions will
support a local project the wildlife trust west cambridgeshire hundreds
project funds related to air travel will be donated to the kasigau corridor
redd project in kenya
    we believe it is important to offset both our direct and indirect
emissions so the offsetting scheme includes an additional 303 tonnes of
co2 attributed to flights booked for external participants attending the
centres workshops

     we are very proud of our core team of about 120 scientific and
     support staff our fellows and our numerous interns we believe
     that these committed professionals position the centre well for
     strong performance in future years

     staff survey

     last seven years evaluating our employee motivation levels
     and gathering views on a range of subjects these include the
     effectiveness of our management leadership and governance
     and our organizational arrangements

     the centre to support our objective of ensuring that staff are
     motivated and engaged it has proved to be very useful and

     response rate of 90 per cent some highlights from this years
     survey include
      the overwhelming majority of staff viewed the partnership
        between unep and wcmc as beneficial with 98 per
        cent agreeing that it is a major asset confidence in our
        partnership has been consistently strong in the survey and
        the current rate is the highest reported level
      in addition to 80 per cent of respondents who agreed that
        the centre is a great place to work 93 per cent agreed that
        it provides exposure to interesting people and new ideas

        to engage with a variety of biodiversity professionals and
        innovative concepts we are pleased that positive responses
        have been in excess of 90 per cent since 2007
