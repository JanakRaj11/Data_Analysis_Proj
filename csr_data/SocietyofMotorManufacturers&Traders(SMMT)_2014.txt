 the report has 23 signatories which represent 959 of vehicle production in the uk new signatories include bosch ceva
 logistics optare and schaeffler however the report covers fewer sites from ford southampton closed toyota salford
 technical site closed and gm millbrook sold

 absolute values for 1999 are not directly comparable to the 2013 data as the number of signatories has changed over the years
 when the 1999 value is unknown the first available figure is given sector turnover rd and jobs dependent on the sector are
 compiled from several official sources using expert smmt analysis the 2012 and 2013 figures are based on projections
