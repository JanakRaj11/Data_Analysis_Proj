   efforts of energy saving                                                          reduction and recycling of waste in production process
 energy saving leads directly to co2 reduction ohara is promoting energy          waste disposal most accounts for the greatest percentage of environmental
 use reduction through energy saving activities under its environmental            cost
 program and activities by energy saving promotion committee                      glass waste disposal cost has a large percentage of the waste disposal cost
 energy saving promotion committee is facilitating activities to eliminate         ohara classifies glass waste into six types one of them is optical glass
 wasteful use of energy and enhance awareness of energy saving focusing           containing tantalum which is a rare metal
 on an energy saving patrol once a month                                          tantalum is an expensive substance and its price is on a rising trend even
 in summer of fy2011 the restriction on the use of electricity was exercised in   now
 accordance with article 27 of electricity business act                           for several years ohara has been consigning rerefining of glass waste
 ohara overcame the difficulty without exceeding limitations on use of             containing tantalum to a raw material supplier for reusing raw materials
 electricity by taking various energy saving measures for example restricting    extracted from such glass waste ohara is thus making a continuous effort
 use of air conditioners with thorough management of room temperature             for effectively using limited resources
 introducing cool biz style and applying heat shield film to windowpanes         we also strive to reduce glass waste by increasing the proportion of recycled
                                                                                   glass
   environmental protection cost
 environmental management covers a wide variety of matters many items
 of cost are thus incurred including costs for installing and maintaining anti
 pollution equipment as well as for waste disposal
 it goes without saying that the incursion of wasteful cost should be avoided
 by grasping the costs for environmental management but such an
 occurrence of the future environmental risk must not be allowed that results




                                                                                                                                                                      environmental protection
 from the failure to lay out a necessary expense
 consequently we accurately grasp the cost effectiveness of each action for
 environmental management to render it effective and free of wasteful cost
 waste disposal cost has come to account for a larger percentage of
 environmental cost                                                               thoroughly separating glass from waste
 therefore a reduction in waste is taken up as one of environmental goals
 and waste reducing activities are being promoted

                           the environmental target in fy2011 was not completely achieved due in part to production affected by temporary halt of
                           power and gas supply caused by the influence of the great east japan earthquake
                           in fy2012 setting new environmental objectives and targets we will be committed to achievement of them all together
