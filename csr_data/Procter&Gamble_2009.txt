stakeholders
external partnerships matter
no single company has all the answers about
sustainability but pg is committed to being
part of the solution meaningful progress requires
the right partners especially when taking on
environmental challenges like solid waste
climate change and water quality tackling
consumer concerns like product safety also
requires collaboration
why do external partnerships matter because
these important topics impact both our world
and our business today and in the future so we
take them seriously dedicating internal resources
while engaging externally only then can we
be part of the conversation helping find the
answers that sustainability demands
