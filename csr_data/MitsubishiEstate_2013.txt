view that looks at business commerce culture and tourism safety and security and the environment

marunouchi spur one another on to greater heights so that marunouchi continues to play a leading
role in enhancing the international competitiveness of tokyo and of all japan

    continuing to practice the basic mission through csv
    the mitsubishi estate group articulates it basic mission as to contribute to society
    through urban development and the group faithfully puts this mission into practice to
    create social value however as a forprofit enterprise it must also create profit and other
    corporate value in the process of generating this social value recently the concept of
    creating shared value csv has been advocated as an approach to balancing this kind of
    social value and corporate value there are three approaches to csv and the three
    initiatives introduced in the special feature precisely illustrate these three approaches
             these three initiatives are the environmentally friendly energysaving products and
    services provided by mec eco life and mitsubishi jisho residence the sustainable use of
    forest resources in mitsubishi estate homes value chain and the development of

opinions by the external advisors on the csr committee



  the meaning of creating shared value for the mitsubishi estate group

  this report emphasizes the concept of creating shared value csv some outsiders occasionally
  misunderstand csv and criticize the stance of companies that emphasize it this is because they
  interpret csv as a calculating approach in which companies decide to address a certain social issue
  when it seems profitable to do so but ignore others where there is no advantage for them the
  mitsubishi estate groups stance is not that simple when any social issue comes up as the group
  interacts with its various stakeholders the group considers it in terms of whether taking up the
  challenge would be socially worthwhile if the group decides that it would be worthwhile it tackles the
  issue boldly i have observed mitsubishi estates decisionmaking process in a range of situations now
  and i can say that the question of whether it is socially worthwhile has always been the starting point
  of the discussion however this alone is not what makes mitsubishi estates approach to csv so
  outstandingits true value is demonstrated in the process following the decision
          the more worthwhile a thing is the more important it is not to give up on it halfwaythe effort
  must be sustained this requires the company to ensure that not only external stakeholders but also
  investors understand and agree that addressing the issue is worthwhile for this reason once
  mitsubishi estate begins an initiative the company examines every aspect and utilizes the strengths of             iwao taka phd

  steadily developing and exploring csr activities for sustainable corporate success

                                        mitsubishi estates csr activities have encompassed education programs for its businesses units and
                                        group companies building systems of information sharing and collaboration and preparation of
                                        operation manuals and standards in this process everyone from staff to directors has consistently
                                        explored csr considering what the company should really accomplish with csr the creating shared
                                        value concept laid out in this csr report provides one answer to this question the report expresses
                                        the firm resolution to integrate economic value and social value real estate development is a business
                                        that utilizes natural resources and transforms environmental resources by giving them added value it is
                                        intrinsically a business that consumes many resources and i believe that acknowledging this fact has
                                        led mitsubishi estate to its firm conviction that in essence creating social value is the only way to
                                        sustainably create economic value and ensure longterm corporate success
                                                 noteworthy initiatives include the groups efforts to develop new technologies based on its
                                        longterm environmental vision the company also laid out a scheme based on resolving social issues
                                        for its urban development business also worth special mention are its efforts to revitalize the domestic

                                       to address this leads to lively debate and new insights
                                               with a shift in the significance of our activities from csr to csv the sustainability of our activities
                                       becomes increasingly important this means that the meaning of our activities moves and deepens from the
