message from the president




we the nri group are aspiring to
put into practice our principle
dream up the future explore
new social paradigms and contribute
to global development not only in japan
but in all of asia and the world




                     allout efforts to aid recovery
                     from the great east japan earthquake

                     i extend my sincerest sympathies to all those who have suffered great losses and
                     devastation in the great east japan earthquake the nri group took immediate and
                     allout action following the massive earthquake on march 11 and is continuing with its
                     disaster relief eﬀorts


                        when the earthquake happened there were two things that immediately flashed
                     through my mind the ﬁrst was the safety of our employees and their families the
                     second was whether our data centers which serve as the lifeline of todays society
                     were operating normally i was tremendously relieved after getting immediate
                     conﬁrmation of the safety of our employees and all relevant parties and on receiving
                     reports that there was no major damage at our data centers we also investigated how
                     our clients were coping with these situations and provided all the assistance we could
                     to aﬀected clients
                        with the subsequent strain on power supplies we have exercised our own initiative
                     in conserving energy announcing energy conservation targets and urging power saving
                     whenever possible through internal newsletters and by other means
                        as nri provides the social infrastructure that serves large number of information
                     systems it is vitally important management issue to secure power for its data centers
                     although the centers are equipped with power generators and other backup systems
                     we faced the risk of frequent power failures and therefore not being able to generate
                     the power they need over a long period of time to prevent such an emergency we

                                                                                               nri csr report 2011

message from the president                                                                                             7



                             have cooperated with industry associations to lobby the electric power utilities and
                             other related organizations to assure a stable supply of power
                                in the group our employees expressed their desire to help the disaster victims
                             and the disasterstruck areas immediately following the natural disaster i myself very
                             much wanted to make a contribution that would be uniquely nri and organized a
                             companywide earthquake disaster reconstruction project in the week following the
                             natural disaster
                                nris uniqueness is found in the fact that it draws on the strength that lies in
                             navigation  solution in the project we started to study what we could do for the
                             disaster victims and the areas in two ﬁelds recommendations utilizing our navigation
                             capabilities and providing it solutions

                             included relief for victims        measures on the fukushima daiichi nuclear plant

                             on lessons learned from the great earthquake after sharing ideas the team announced
                             recommendations on policies and measures to cope with the situation on the other
                             hand in the ﬁeld of it solutions we provided three services analysis and report on the
                             opinions the disaster victims gathered through sns a feedback message system that
                             linked disaster victims and their supporters and the smartphone application tooreta

                                in addition to these activities the nri group plans to continue oﬀering assistance in
                             the long term including participation in developing a disaster reconstruction plan for

                             progress with vision 2015 our longterm management plan

                             under vision 2015 announced in 2008 we are acting in line with the corporate slogan
                             reinventing ourselves reinventing the future to move the group from a business
                             that had been focused on project commissions from individual corporate clients where
                             the nri group has exercised its strengths to a company which will be able to deliver
                             industrystandard business platforms meaning systems and services that provide the
                             functions required by business corporations eﬃciently and that form part of the social
                             infrastructure in order to achieve this goal our employees need to develop a mindset
                             that transcends our existing operationswith a depth of knowledge and a wide vision
                             across industries and markets a willingness to take risks in advance investments and
                             eﬀective alliances with other companies
                                in view of the rapid growth in the expansion of japanese businesses into other
                             countries we need to undergo a transition to a new business structure from domestic
                             oriented operation to global one that supports these activities

                             system which it owned and managed as its own asset in recent years however
                             there is growing demand for usage of standard it services that deliver a high level
                             of cost performance in business segments that are not directly linked to the need for
                             discrimination against the competition nri plans to strengthen and expand its business
                             model which offers its own systems as an industrystandard business platform for
                             clients to use we expect to see this change in the tide from ownership to usage to
                             grow rapidly and believe that our plan is positively in step with this new direction
                                the ohmi merchants of japan have traditionally embraced the saying good for
                             all three this saying reﬂects their philosophy that business continuity is not possible
                             when only the seller makes a proﬁt but is good for all three parties namely good for
                             the seller good for the buyer and good for society
                                adopting this business philosophy in explaining the industrystandard business
                             platforms that the nri group is developing i would describe our groups efforts as
                             good for business enterprises good for the customers and good for the environment
                             when an industrystandard business platform is in use we will be able to bring
                             satisfaction to our corporate clients who will be relieved of any initial investment
                             maintenance and management of their information system the resources that have
                             been saved in this way can then be directed toward making bigger improvements in
                             the services the company oﬀers its customers hence bringing satisfaction to customers
                             since these sharedtype services can be provided to many business enterprises from
                             one system there will be a dramatic reduction in electric power consumption and co2
                             emissions compared to developing and managing business systems independently this
                             means that the model is environmentally friendly it should be clear that nris data
                             centers also fulﬁll an important role as part of the social infrastructure in the area of
                             environmental protection

                       which was launched in ﬁscal 2006 through its second threeyear plan to double
                       quality which started in 2008 this plan aimed to reduce system failures

                       year earlier in ﬁscal 2009 this is the result of the failure reduction activity model
                       taking root in daytoday business operations
                          the failure reduction activity model consists of two activities one is meetings
                       on failure reduction held to into the root cause of the problems that extend
                       to the planning and execution of corrective measures the other is aimed at
                       implementing medium and longrange measures based on an analysis of the failure
                       mechanism and trends in root causes that are shared by a number of separate
                       failure cases
                          the third threeyear plan to double quality was started in fiscal 2010 to
                       achieve further reductions in failures and to reduce calls from operational
                       personnel to development personnel spurred by alarms from systems in full
                       operation a clear future policy was established to promote greater visibility of
                       failures and to reduce the number of problems at a level that does not directly
                       aﬀect the client the reduction in calls reached the target set up early in ﬁscal
                       2010 and has contributed to improvements in labor aﬀairs the plan will continue

   opportunity to contact their clients or to propose plans and this does not encourage the growth
   of sales or their capabilities to make proposals
      for this reason in fiscal 2010 a program was introduced to build the customer sales and
   proposal capabilities of young engineers under this program employees in this field are assigned
   to consulting and systems consulting business divisions as interns to gain experience in actual
   business operations interns on the program work as consultants which involves undergoing
   consultant training and participating in actual projects involving submitting plans and proposals
      in march 2011 an interim report meeting was held by employees who had been on the
   program for six months the trainees reported that they were able to gain experience that was
   different from their past job duties including producing proposals and reports on what the
   projects they had been involved in achieved and giving presentations to clients trainees also
   reported a reaffirmation of the importance of communication a broader outlook gained by
   acquiring a new perspective on things the discovery of new personal issues that need to be
   addressed in the future and other benefits

   conference on enhancement work for innovation held independently by a
   business partner

   cube system has supported enhancement work for innovation to further improve quality and
   productivity since 2006 we started by participating in two model projects one year later we saw
   quality and productivity improve beyond our expectations and increased the number of projects
   we participate in
      in 2008 we decided to bring change not only on a project basis but for the entire company and
   started activities independently the enhancement work for innovation conference is one such
   effort nri has produced results by organizing various conferences aimed at information sharing
   and growth between all participants we hope to build some momentum for own activities by
   holding these conferences
      in a questionnaire circulated to our employees and our business partners after the
   conference we discovered that awareness of improvements rose tremendously when we
   had just began working in this area the atmosphere was one in which all action had to be
   prompted by managers as quality and productivity rose it became natural among us to push to
   enhance business innovation employee awareness also changed with a willingness to make
   improvements where problems exist today these innovation activities are being implemented as
   the norm in our workplaces
      starting in fiscal 2010 we have set up not only shortterm goals but also a goal to resolve
   major issues on in the longer term for this purpose in the recent conference held to review our
   achievements in fiscal 2010 we did not report that all of our goals were resolved however we
   intend to continue promoting these activities continuously to achieve our goals
      cube system continues to work together with nri in implementing these activities there
   are also differences in the content of the activities between different projects we hope to bring
   enhancement to enable mutual growth by setting targets across business divisions and other
   efforts

                       social development and improving group corporate value
