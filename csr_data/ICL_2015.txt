    example vecap which has been adopted by the icl industrial products segment establishes among
    others best practices for the handling of used packaging that contains residues of products

    in addition icl applies its product stewardship policy to the customers use of the product by providing
    guidelines and training for customers about the efficient and sustainable use of its products

    the fertilizer industry helps to overcome agriculture challenges facilitating increasing crop yields on
    existing agricultural land thereby preventing the conversion of natural habitats to agricultural land this
    can also be accomplished by promoting the correct use of fertilizers through teaching and disseminating
    information about effective and sustainable fertilization methods

    for this purpose icl fertilizers has instituted a worldwide customer instruction and training program to
    promote safe and intelligent use of fertilizers

    icl agronomists have been engaging for years in training farmers how to use fertilizers wisely and
    effectively the agronomists provide guidance on the balanced use of fertilizers ie the application of
    plant nutrients in the optimum ratio and adequate amounts for sustaining high yields while maintaining
    soil productivity and fertility

    dead sea works in collaboration with the international potash institute ipi develops and encourages
    the use of balanced fertilization to achieve higher yields and better quality while maintaining soil fertility
    for future generations and preventing the conversion of natural land to agricultural land

    potassium k nitrogen n and phosphorus p are the three essential nutrients consumed in large
    quantities by plants potassium fertilizer increases the yield and quality of agricultural produce
    improves plant resistance to diseases and pests increases the plants tolerance to drought and
    cold and contributes to the development of a strong and healthy root system the uniqueness of
    potassium is that it increases the efficiency of use of nitrogen and other nutrients therefore the use of
    potassium results in better utilization of nitrogen fertilizer and prevents it from reaching groundwater or
    evaporating

    for over a decade icl has invested half a million dollars every year to carry out information campaigns
    by the companys agronomists in developing countries such as bangladesh sri lanka china the
    philippines brazil mozambique and elsewhere the goal of the program is to reach isolated and remote
    villages and to spread the word about the importance of potassium as fertilizer for agriculture icl
    personnel work with agronomists researchers and government agencies around the world to provide
    training services through the ipi

    in 2014 icl launched two new programs one in india  potash for life and the other in ethiopia  potash
