           message from the ceo

                               social responsibility and the promotion of sustainability
                               are central to nea odos strategy and daily operation
                             by publishing this report our company wishes to
                               record its planning and performance in critical issues
                               connected to its financial efficacy social awareness and
                               environmental policy we like to back up our words with
                               data but at the same time we strive through this report
                               to form and develop through time a new platform a new
                               channel of communication with our social partners and
                               the stakeholders that contribute to our companys growth
                               and are affected by its activities

                                even though 2014 was yet another year of macroeconomic
                                uncertainty and significant structural problems for the
     domestic financial system nea odos continues and will continue to implement
     its business plan without fail remaining faithful to its vision to contribute to the
     greek economy by upgrading national road and transportation infrastructure and
     offering both direct and indirect financial benefits on a local regional and national
     level always with a view to sustainable development

     with a sense of responsibility towards every driver on the road and society as a
     whole road safety is at the core of our philosophy minimizing accidents through
     targeted interventions and emphasizing the promotion of responsible driving
     behaviour are key priorities for the company and our associated partners

     we strive to be a communally active socially responsible company contributing
     significantly to the public interest we pay special attention to the local communities
     of adjacent regions and contribute to a better quality of life through targeted
     activities and responsible practices we choose local suppliers for our projects
     and we always try to find our employees from the neighbouring municipalities
     communities and villages in 2014 for example 17 of our employees were from
     the wider area of viotia and 39 from other areas outside attica especially during
     this difficult period for the greek economy we try on an annual basis to implement
     actions of welfare support of vulnerable groups of the population and sponsorship
     of the programs of nonprofit organisations

     another strategic goal is motorway user satisfaction to this end we implement
     a quality management system certified in accordance with iso 90012008
     requirements placing priority on constantly improving the quality of our services
     a result and a reward of our efforts are the results of related opinion surveys
     among users of the motorways managed by our company more than 90 of the
     persons surveyed have a favourable opinion of nea odos expressing their high
     satisfaction with the various services we offer




                                               8

         metamorfosi ic to skarfia after kamena vourla
     c pathe connecting branch schimatari  chalkida of a length of
        11 km

     a motorway not only needs to be constructed according to the
     most modern and reliable international standards but like a
     living organism also requires constant monitoring in order to
     be maintained in an excellent and safe condition nea odos has
     undertaken the operation and maintenance of the ionia odos
     concession project for 30 years among its main competences
     we find control and monitoring of traffic as well as managing
     emergencies through the special traffic management centers and
     the 24hour road safety patrols programming and management
     of the required maintenance works as well as a significant
     number of routine works for example the cleaning of the road
     especially as regards the critical part of maintenance it includes
     daily inspections scheduled and unscheduled repair works as
     well as maintenance works for the companys fleet and facilities




     the primary objective is to provide safe and fast transportation
     conditions as well as high quality services to all motorway users

                                     10

ionia odos is the connecting branch between the bridge
of antirrio and egnatia odos ic in ioannina this 196 km

corporate responsibility material issues

in 2014 we identified defined and prioritised the material corporate social
                                                                                       
responsibility issues in order to effectively meet the challenges and the critical
issues that arise from the operation of our company

we followed the guidelines of the global reporting initiative organisation
version g4
1 the corporate responsibility aspects and issues were recorded as well as
    their subsequent effects related to the companys operation the strategic
    planning and its separate divisions and productive stages the relationship
    of the aspects and issues with the ultimate objective of sustainable
    development was analysed
2 the degree of risk for each of these aspects and issues was then determined
    using as criteria the smooth operation and development of the companys
    activities as well as the potential effects positive andor negative they may
    have on all social partners
3 the separate corporate responsibility aspects were grouped into
    high medium and low priority and emphasis was put on recording our
    performance the practices we follow and our goals in managing most
    critical issues

we aspire to implement the specific procedure on a regular basis considering
potential challenges and trends emerging from the companys internal or
external environment we also intend to expand this procedure by including
the opinion of the companys stakeholder groups regarding the significance of
separate issues the opinion of stakeholders will thus play an active role in the
management of these issues

                                    5 road safety
                     promoting responsible driving behaviour

                     more than 1 million people lose their lives every year in traffic accidents
                     across the world international organisations like the world bank and
                   the united nations a number of global nonprofit organisations the eu
                     as well as every state separately have recognised the critical nature and
                     multifaceted consequences of this sad reality

     nea odos sa with a sense of responsibility towards all drivers and the broader community
     has set the promotion of road safety at the core of its philosophy and operation

                     the number of traffic accidents annually is particularly high in greece
                     our country for a number of years now has been ranking in the negative
                     2nd and 3rd place in europe regarding the number of traffic accidents
                     in relation to the population in fact according to the estimates of the
                     hellenic institute of transportation engineers the financial and social
                     cost of this sad reality exceeds 3 billion  annually road safety is
                     therefore a truly major national issue for greece

                     the challenge is enormous because many factors play a role in road
                     safety modern infrastructure policing principles as well as prevention
                     management of accidents training and mentality of drivers every factor
                     may possibly even if all others are at exceptional levels derail the final
                     objective this is why at nea odos we believe that road safety must be an
                     area of cooperation and mutual commitment for all

                     we on our side with a sense of responsibility towards all drivers and
                     the broader community have set the promotion of road safety at the core
                     of our philosophy and operation combining optimal daily maintenance
                     work on motorways with the provision of quality care services we strive
                     to contribute as much as possible to travel safety for all drivers for
                     example we mention that in the years that we have been responsible for
                     the maintenance and operation of specific parts of the pathe motorway
                     the accident rates have dropped by 626 this percentage tangibly
                     proves that the minimisation of accidents through targeted practices and
                     interventions and the constant improvement of our approach in safety
                     risk management are the main priority for nea odos and its associated
                     partners




                     since 2010 nea odos has distributed 1733 million leaf
                     lets to passing drivers aiming to promote safety on the
                     road and responsible driving behaviour


                                                         22

            road safety is everyones responsibility

apart from our diverse activities within a context of infrastructure and
training at nea odos we believe that educating drivers together with
providing correct and complete information is the most critical factor
                                                                                
for accident prevention we thus strive to contribute in changing the
mentality of motorway users towards a safer and less aggressive
behaviour on the road which in addition to road safety also promotes
sustainable mobility

in this context our company implements various activities focusing on
road safety ultimately aspiring to cultivate correct driving behaviour
with knowledge and skills that can significantly contribute to reducing
traffic accidents these actions include the regular distribution of leaflets
to passing drivers with
 general advise for safe driving
 references to special issues such as fuel saving through changing
     driving behaviour driving in tunnels or wet or snow covered road

                                      place



                                                                        26

              patrols  safety inspections
              regular traffic on the motorway and provide assistance for an effective response
              to emergencies the most important of which are the following

                 instant intervention patrolling
                 identification of emergencies
                 removal of foreign objects from the road
                 assistance to immobilised vehicles
                 signage of emergencies
              
              
                  assistance for removal of immobilised vehicles
                  support to competent emergency state services
                                                                                                          
                 assistance to fire extinguishing until the fire department intervenes
                 escorts for oversized freight if deemed necessary
                 escorts for vehicles with hazardous loads through tunnels if deemed
                  necessary

              the role of road safety patrols is equally important in the inspections of motorway
              infrastructure and equipment with the aim of assuring their technical adequacy
              and identifying potential risks for users it is worth noting here that the above
              special patrols take place six times a week with the use of a lowspeed vehicle
              that doesnt obstruct traffic flow while occasionally there may be need for a
              safety patrol on foot by a specialised employee

              in combination with road safety patrols there are safety inspections every 7
              days once a week by trained technical staff with a lowspeed vehicle while
              again there may occasional need for a safety patrol on foot by a specialised
              employee

              moreover and in addition to the above detailed road inspections are carried out
              at the order of any competent state service

              it is worth noting that all safety inspections are carried out during nonpeak
              periods in order to minimise any obstruction to traffic while at least one safety
              inspection a month is carried out during night time




in 2014 the road safety patrol cars covered a distance 5
                                                                                                75
                                                                                              10

     at the toll stations as well as along the length of the motorway wherever there
     are cameras installed mainly with the purpose of traffic regulation identification
     of emergencies and user safety a number of related information signs have been
     installed

     the closed circuit television cc tv and computer screens at the control centers of
     the traffic management center provide access to information and visual material the
     management of which is government by the data protection law and the relevant
     instruction for cc tv of the hellenic data protection authority moreover nea odos
     strictly prohibits the use of cc tv by the staff for observing incidents on the road which
     are not related to its safety and smooth operation

     road may always exercise the right to access the information that concerns them and
     to object to the use of that information

toll fares

ongoing investments are required in order to maintain the quality
characteristics of any contemporary motorway paying toll rates is
one of the most effective methods for financing the construction and
maintenance as well as for constant improvement of our cuttingedge
motorways and the services offered
                                                                                
at this stage and in accordance with the institutional framework of
nea odos three toll zones are identified

   the first toll zone includes metamorfosi ic to schimatari ic with a
    total length of 51km
   the second zone includes schimatari ic to martino ic with a total
    length of 596 km
   the third zone includes martino ic to the end of the motorway in
    skarfia

the toll rate per station is determined as follows
 at each frontal toll station and per direction the toll rate is determined
    based on the total length of the zone to which it belongs
 at the exit from lateral toll stations the toll rate corresponds to the
    length travelled from the beginning of the zone where the station
    belongs up to the station in the lateral toll stations the toll rate
    corresponds to the length of the road to be travelled by the user from
    the toll station to the end of the zone

under no circumstances can any user who has paid the toll fee at the
frontal station pay again at a lateral station in the same zone during
the same journey respectively under no circumstances can any user
who has paid the toll fee at the lateral station pay again at a frontal
station in the same zone during the same journey

      reducing fuel consumption change of fleet

      nea odos with the purpose of reducing fuel consumption by the
      vehicles of its fleet changed them in 2014 by combining financial
      efficiency with the protection of the environment in total 26 cars
      that used petrol were replaced with similar ones that use diesel fuel
      leading to significant benefits concerning fuel consumption gas
    emissions as well as the cost of transportation this car replacement
      program led to saving 35140 lt of petrol in 2014 these savings
      are expected to be significantly greater in the coming years since
      the replacement of the vehicles was gradual starting in mid2014
      therefore the quantity of the petrol saved is expected to be much
      greater over the coming period


     energy consumption for heating
     energy is consumed for the heating needs of the buildings and other facilities of
     the company the main source of the energy used is electricity while oil is used
     only in cases of generators and as a result the quantity of heating oil consumed is
     small specifically 4000 lt of heating oil were consumed in total in 2014


                                                                          2014

     consumption of electricity in buildings and roads
     in various locations of the motorways as a result of the laws regulations studies
     and the concession agreement the installation of road lighting systems has been
     deemed necessary which cover their needs in energy either through consumption
     of electricity or solar energy

     nea odos makes every possible effort for an efficient use of energy and to this end
     it is planning the redesign of an administration building according to bioclimatic
     architecture specifications with parallel use of renewable sources of energy


      the company has installed solar collectors at the 236 emergency
      roadside telephones ert and therefore energy from renewable
      sources of energy is consumed the average electrical voltage of
      each ert is 15 w and therefore the annual savings thanks to the
      solar panels are 110108 mj

             limited due to the type of activity  quantities of waste which the company
             manages in the appropriate manner and in any case in accordance with legal
             provisions and regulations

             according to the companys environmental policy its primary goal is to constantly
             improve the environmental performance achieved among other things through
           minimising the waste produced by the various activities by utilising or recycling
             them the potential environmental impacts arising from the operation and
             maintenance of the motorway are recorded analysed and measured in order
             to minimise the negative effects and eliminate any possible burden on the

             air quality monitoring

                              due to the burning of fossil fuels by the companys fleet as well as
                              the heating and operating needs of buildings and various facilities
                              there are gaseous emissions the companys standing objective
                              is to efficiently use energy in order to achieve corresponding low
                              levels of emissions

                              at the same time the company seeks to inform and raise the
                              awareness of drivers through the distribution of specialised
                              leaflets with the purpose of promoting ecofriendly driving eco
                              friendly driving apart from being more economical in terms of
                              energy consumption also leads to lower gas emissions while it
                              can further contribute to safe transportation

                            in order to monitor air pollution produced by the operation of
                            the motorway the company has installed three air pollution
                            measurement stations in varympompi schimatari and arkitsa
             the stations operate on a 24hour basis and the values of the following pollutants
             and parameters are recorded
              pollutants co co2 no no2 so2 o3 tsp pm10 pm2 pm5 c6h6 benzene
                 c7h8 toluene and xylene

                                                        48

the stations have been in operation since 2012 and the company implements
annual air pollution monitoring programs in cooperation with the department of
civil engineering of the university of thessaly and submits the relevant annual air
pollution reports to the competent public services

according to the station recordings and the relevant report issued in 2014 air
pollution limits were not exceeded as a result of traffic on the motorway


noise monitoring                                                                       
one of the effects of the construction and operation of motorways
is the emission of noise from the passing vehicles nea odos
monitors noise levels on a regular basis by making systematic
sound measurements at various locations of the motorways and
takes all the measures necessary in order to ensure that the noise
level from the operation of the project is within the limits set out by
the applicable laws

to this end with the goal of measurement independence special
traffic noise monitoring programs are implemented on an annual
basis with the support of the laboratory of transportation
environmental acoustics of the department of civil engineering
of the university of thessaly in this framework 24hour sound
measurements with hourly analysis are carried out along the
length of the road at various points

the companys standard policy is to minimise the disturbance potentially caused
to various adjacent areas of the project and all the necessary measures are taken
installation of sound barriers etc where deemed necessary as a result of the
measurements the relative legislation and the studies that are carried out

moreover the company seeking to minimise the disturbance that is potentially
caused to various adjacent areas of the project and to cooperate with the local
communities in the areas it is active in keeps an open line of communication
which anyone who wishes to express a concern or complaint regarding the noise
