besides focusing on our strategic and operational tar

     strategic planning for sartorius 2020

     sartorius aims to grow sustainably and profitably in
     the future as well the group thus plans to generate
     sales revenue of around 2 billion by 2020 approxi
     mately twothirds of this growth is to be achieved
     organically around one third through acquisitions
     moreover sartorius plans to increase its underlying
     ebitda margin to around 23 sartorius has executed
     on its 2020 strategic plan developed in 2011 by im
     plementing a number of initiatives related to regional
     growth product portfolio and infrastructure

     in view of our organic growth and continued im
     provement of profitability we are on track to achieve
     these goals however the sales revenue that can be
     contributed by acquisitions substantially depends on
     the availability of appropriate takeover targets

     regionally north america is a focus of sartorius growth
     strategy both for the manufacture of biopharmaceuti
     cals and laboratory products north america is the
     worlds largest market sartorius still has belowaverage
     market share in this region also because the usa is the
     home market for the vast majority of our competitors
     to gain market share we have strengthened our capa
     cities primarily in sales distribution and services and
     enhanced our sales processes

     our second regional focus is on asia especially on
     china and india these markets have tremendous po
     tential and are growing at higherthanaverage rates
     to participate in this momentum in the best possible
     way sartorius considerably invested in its sales infra
     structure in this region as well

     in addition acquisitions primarily focused on comple
     mentary technologies and products are to contribute
     to our future growth over the past years we success
     fully expanded our wide array of products and services
     through several small and mediumsized acquisitions

     to make business processes more efficient sartorius
     is globally introducing a new erp system which is
     already in use at group headquarters in goettingen
     germany moreover we are continuously expanding
     capacity at our manufacturing sites in goettingen we
     are combining our plant sites still located in separate
     areas into one location as part of a multiyear project
     at the same time we are extending our local produc
     tion capacities

     sartorius grew considerably yet again in 2014 sales
     revenue rose by 113 in constant currencies thus
     slightly exceeding the forecast range of 8 to 10
     announced at the beginning of the year the profit
     margin based on underlying ebitda rose to 202
     slightly above our forecast of approximately 20

     to facilitate future growth sartorius expanded capaci
     ties in several production facilities and invested in its
     it systems in the reporting year the capex ratio rela
     tive to sales revenue amounted to 86 well in line
     with the 8 to 10 range forecasted at the beginning
     of the year

     the groups financial position remained broadly un
     changed and stable the equity ratio was 391 after
     381 in 2013 and thus remained at a comfortable
     level the ratio of net debt to underlying ebitda for
     the last twelve months was 17 following on from 20
     in 2013 and thus developed slightly better than fore
     casted at the start of the year

     the attrition rate which expresses the number of
     people leaving the company as a percentage of the
     average head count fell to 86 for the group in the
     reporting year previous year 93 the attrition rate
     generally varies from region to region and this is also
     true at sartorius at our german sites this rate is
     typically low in 2014 it stood at 44 after 39 in
     the previous year in countries with a high average
     attrition rate such as china and india sartorius suc
     cessfully lowered this rate through various employee
     retention and motivation activities as a result the
     attrition rate in asia dropped considerably from
     119 to 84 in the fiscal year under review

     the absence rate or the proportion of planned work
     ing time that is not worked due to general absences
     decreased in the reporting year across the group even
     the average time missed per employee due to illness
     dropped from 71 days in 2013 to 66 in fiscal 2014

in europe the region contributing the highest share of
sales revenue of more than 50 sales revenue did not
quite reach the high prioryear level 12 here the
discontinuation of nonstrategic products still had a
noticeable impact on sales in the year under review in
asia  pacific which accounts for around 27 of
business for the lab products  services division sales
revenue grew 14 this figure was affected by the
weak market environment at the beginning of the year
particularly in china in north america that generated
approximately 16 of the divisions revenues sales
revenue climbed significantly by 133 the strong
demand for our laboratory instruments as well as our
consumable products and services contributed to this
