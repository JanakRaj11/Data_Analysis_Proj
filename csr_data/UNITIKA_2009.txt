specifically co2 emissions related to energy use in order to                                     emissions decreased in fiscal 2008 this was in part due to

   logistics

to reduce the environmental impact of transportation needed for inputs of raw materials and outputs of products and waste products unitika
implements the four logistic guidelines shown below these guidelines have helped us make acrosstheboard improvements in transportation
efficiency and in reducing energy consumption and emissions gases



        we will shorten transport distances by lending borrowing or swapping generaluse products or materials of equal quality with other companies

        within japan we will use container transport by sea or rail whenever possible since these methods enable mass transport and are energyefficient

        forklifts used for work inside sites will be changed from enginedriven models to environmentallyfriendly batterydriven models with zero emissions
        gases and low noise

        we will reduce transportation energy consumption by using flexible containers that can wrap larger numbers of products instead of paper bag
        wrapping materials and by shaping containers for more efficient truck loading


in line with an april 2006 revision to japans laws pertaining to rationalized energy consumption we have started energysaving initiatives for logistic
in fy 2008 unitika and unitika group companies were registered as the designated shippers for a total freight transport volume of 95586 thousand
tonkm resulting in a co2 emissions volume of 33 thousand tons tco2

based on unitikas corporate vision of being a company that                            communicated these to those in the surrounding communities while
contributes to peoples lives and the environment and that has a                       taking steps to ensure their nonrecurrence in all such situations we will

business and activities in ways that are considerate of the people living               living environments of the people living around us
around us despite these efforts in fiscal 2008 we still received a                    further in fiscal 2008 for unitika and the unitika group there were no
number of complaints regarding noise industrial odors and other                       incidences of accident or pollution that might have led to environmental
incidences of environmental disturbance                                                problems nor were there any violations of environmental laws and

   anticorrosive sheeting

   segurova
japans river law was partially revised in june 1997 and in line                already become the first product in the industry to be awarded the
with the new law unitika fibers developed segurova an                          public works research centers anticorrosion sheet performance
anticorrosive sheeting material designed with the concern to natural             evaluation certification certification no 0001
environments and landscapes manufactured using a 3d weaving
technology to ensure that gaps and thicknesses are kept constant
segurova resists water currents and provides high corrosion
resistance designed for weather resistance and endurance it is
mainly comprised of black clopedyed polyester monofilament to
give some components partial dimensional stability they use binder
fibers with a core and pod structure the sheet top and bottom
layers have a honeycomb structure for easy filling with earth or
sand segurova can be used in embankment protection works to
reinforce the corrosion resistance of herbaceous plants such as
lawns or seedlings it stops corrosion by water currents at
embankment surfaces and river banks realizing a new

    exhibition biodegradable planters

     tokyo fiber 09 was held from april 2127 2009 at la triennale di
     milano in milan italy
     unitika exhibited segurova its anticorrosive sheeting made from its
     plantderived biomass material terramac our design proposed a
     new type of environmentallyfriendly planter in collaboration with
     flower artist makoto azuma we created a moss garden titled
     biodegradable planter in the middle of the exhibition room a
     waterproof sheet was first laid out and covered with terramac
     segurova this was then covered with moss and japanese royal
     ferns and scattered with grass seed the grass grew 5 cm by the end
     of the exhibition the popular ecological material attracted attention as
     a carbonneutral planter that can be freely shaped and is quite unlike
     anything else on the market

demand for pet bottles has been growing year by year and the
cost of fossil fuelbased plastics is rising sharply for that reason                           pet bottle recovery
used bottles have become an important resource themselves as
part of our efforts to preserve the environment unitika has been
active in pet bottle recycling uniecolo was developed through our                    removal of impurities such as caps and labels
outstanding spinning technology offering soft handfeeling and
good bulkiness it is an environmentallyaware fiber with the same

   plantderived biomass material

   castlon
castlon is a 100 plantderived nylon fiber with low environmental
impact it is made from the inedible seeds of the castor oil plant                                                                      castor oil plant

it features a unique molecular structure unlike that of conventional
nylon fiber that gives it excellent wear bend and fatigue
resistance as well as resistance to solvents dimensional stability
and flexibility at low temperatures this upandcoming material is
lightweight and while its characteristics make it perfect for use in                                                            castor oil beans
