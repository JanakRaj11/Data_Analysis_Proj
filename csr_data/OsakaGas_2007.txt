                  method of assessment of the effectiveness of gas cogeneration system in reduction of co2 emission
                   promotion of gas cogeneration systems is one of the important objectives of the japanese energy policy to encourage wider use of gas cogeneration its
                   effectiveness in reducing co2 emission should be properly assessed and understood as well it is important for business entities to disclose and report the
                   measures they have taken to reduce greenhouse gas emission such as introduction of cogeneration and to assess the effects of such measures in an
                   appropriate manner and make public the results of the assessment doing so will facilitate greater industrial efforts to reduce co2 emission and eventually lead to
                   nationwide commitment to control of co2 emission

                   1 proper assessment method of the effectiveness of gas cogeneration in reducing co2 emission
                   to properly assess how the introduction of gas cogeneration systems has
                   contributed to the reduction of co2 emissions we should calculate the amount of co2                                                   the amount of co2
                                                                                                                                                                                                           the amount of          co2 emission factor of

                   the environmental report guidelines 2007 issued by the ministry of the environment in june 2007 specifies the method to assess the effectiveness of individual greenhouse
                   gas emission reduction measures to be disclosed in csr reports as follows
                   op6 amount of greenhouse gas emission and emission reduction measures matters to be noted when calculating relevant indicators p78
                   iii if you can specify the source of electricity that is affected by the implementation of individual greenhouse gas emission reduction measures you can calculate the effectiveness of the
                   measures by multiplying the emission factor of the electricity from the affected source by the amount of electricity reduced
                   example of the calculation of the effectiveness of emission reduction measures using the emission factor factor of thermal power plants is shown on p127 please visit the website of the ministry of the environment for more information

                  2 information disclosure under the                                scheme for calculation reporting and publication of greenhouse gas emission
                   with the enforcement of the amended law concerning the promotion of the measures to cope with global warming in april 2006 the scheme for calculation reporting and
                   publication of greenhouse gas emission was launched however the form 1 issued under this scheme only requires the amount of greenhouse gas emission and has no
                   space for the reason for increasedecrease in emission greenhouse gas emission per sale and the effectiveness of individual emission reduction measures to cover such
                   information form 2 was introduced which can be effectively used for reporting the effectiveness of cogeneration in reducing co2 emission

                   1 purpose of the review
                       as a third party not involved with the business of osaka gas co ltd we evaluated the social and environmental performance described in the
                        csr report 2007 which osaka gas co ltd prepared and hereby express our opinions for the purpose of ensuring its credibility

                   2 procedures
                       in order to develop our understanding on the planning and implementation process of the social and environmental activities of the company as
                       well as the evaluation of its performance and utilization of its data we interviewed mr katsumi makino managing director and csr executive
                       and put questions to persons in charge at the headquarter office we conducted sampling checks using procedures partly based on those in
                       financial auditing where necessary to determine whether work is being performed accordingly to compile data for disclosure at kinpai

                   3 conclusions
                       fy2007 is the initial year of the new mediumterm plan for which new targets to be achieved by fy2009 have been set some of the initial
                       targets set for five areas have already been achieved and other targets are also likely to be met by fy2009 judging from the good performance
                       shown so far in fy2008 it will be necessary to review the level of performance and reexamine the appropriateness of the initially set targets in
                       greater depth to ensure that all the targets will be achieved in the last year of the mediumterm plan the groupwide efforts for environmental
                       preservation have achieved steady progress and we expect more numerical environmental targets will be set and applied to all the affiliated
                       companies information on social activities is disclosed in sufficient detail especially the information on employment and work conditions is fully
                       provided reflecting the characteristics of the basic management philosophy of fostering personal growth through work we suggest that like
                       environmental performance some targets be set for social performance as well if numerical targets are difficult to set then qualitative targets
                       will do the process of setting targets by collecting the opinions of as many stakeholders as possible is very helpful in strengthening the basis of
                       csr management in addition no significant errors were found in the calculation of the environmental performance data over the range that we
                       examined by the procedures described

                   significant performance matters
                      1 environmental management system ems
                      comprehensive ems has already been in place at osaka gas and now efforts are underway to expand its coverage to the entire group some
                      form of management standards including osaka gas ems ogems will be introduced to all the affiliated companies by the end of fy2009
                      and accordingly the importance of setting environmental targets is being applied to groupwide performance at the same time uniform formats
                      should be applied to all the business locations and affiliated companies for collection of environmental data to ensure necessary data will be
                      collected more promptly and easily considering that evaluation of environmental performance is determined by the data collected for this
                      purpose it is important to design a farsighted data collection system in anticipation of future developments

                       we found that at kinpai an effective management system is in place and properly operated and environmental management is pursued in a
                       manner required of members of the osaka gas group on the other hand its information collection system though operated meticulously is still
                       dependent on manual work compared with the system in place at osaka gas we recommend that kinpai produce an operation manual to
                       ensure more systematic operation

                       2 environmental accounting and management indicators
                       at osaka gas sophisticated environmental management indicators applicable to both the environmental accounting system and the
                       performance evaluation system have been used and contributed to effective environmental preservation activities however years have passed
                       since these indicators were set and a review of the indicators is now required to address the drastic changes in circumstances that have taken
                       place over these years therefore we suggest that the environmental management system and environmental information collection system be
                       revised and at the same time the environmental management indicators be redesigned to better reflect reality the environmental information in
                       possession of osaka gas is very reliable and useful we believe more versatile indicators will be needed if osaka gas is to pursue management
                       focusing on not only environment but also csr

                   efforts to address global warming next 21
                       we inspected the next 21 experimental residential complex of osaka gas where various innovative experiments are conducted to envisage
                       future lifestyles through the actual living experience of the occupants these experiments will contribute to the enhancement of energy
                       efficiency waste reduction increase of housing durability preservation of biodiversity and promotion of neighborhood communications and
                       should be highly evaluated we believe that by conducting the next 21 project to explore both social and environmental sustainability osaka
                       gas will not only open up possibilities for its future development but also contribute to the wellbeing of the society at large we hope that the
                       achievements of this project will be effectively used for the purpose of realizing a sustainable society

                     the contents of this year s csr report are arranged in line with the csr charter allowing the activities of osaka gas in each category to be
                     presented clearly the report begins with special topics which highlights the priority issues that osaka gas wants to communicate to the
                     readers throughout the report we can see the sincere attitude of osaka gas to provide reliable information in a straightforward way and such
                     an attitude deserves to be commended
