   a letter from the chairman
   and managing director
    we believe that the csr report must hold a central place in our group philosophy it is
an important step that represents a consistent and universal expression of the principles and
values that underlie our style as a company and it has to be addressed with real determination
it is thus our great pleasure to inform you that we are continuing down the path we started
five years ago by creating the 2016 edition of our csr this confirms our will and our focus on
sustainabilityoriented social progress
    this is a very important decision our approach aims not only at communicating and bearing
witness to what we have already accomplished but is a commitment to do even better
    creating sustainable values is a concept that makes us think and dream it makes us think
because being sustainable means to be able to stand the test of time an approach
reflecting the origins of the companies that have merged into our group with almost
one century of commitment of care for the customer the products corporate staff and all
corporate stake holders this extensive background incorporates eptas will to be a group that
becomes stronger and greater over time
    that also leaves room for dreams because being sustainable also means to give more
than we get to build a greater presence and a more widely shared social progress and
dreams make us imagine and create a better world
    we strongly believe that committing to research and to the creation of solutions that optimise
the utilisation of natural energy sources should be a founding policy for every industrial
organisation in the past three years we have reached and even exceeded the important
goals that we set for ourselves
    1 we have reached more than 50 of energy saving products in our range
    2 we have reduced our energy consumption in the past four years measured as
kilograms of oil equivalent per manufactured unit koe this achievement of a 12 reduction
is due to our implementation of many new production technologies including limana glass
factory which has allowed us to bring certain previously outsourced activities inhouse
    we are still following our decision to efficiently use energy sources and our goal for the
next three years is a further 5 reduction in energy consumption measured against our
output
    year after year these initiatives and objectives will be our guide in improving our performance
and making further progress so that we may exceed the longterm goals that we have set for
ourselves

         a certified reputation for a responsible future
         a goal that is common to all the group companies is sustainable social growth and the construction
         of real progress this commitment constantly aims at the highest standards of excellence and
         becomes tangible in eptas certifications as early as in 1996 epta group was certified iso 9001

         subsequently this quality management system was extended to the other group companies
         epta france costan eurocryor epta argentina epta deutschland epta iberia epta istanbul epta
         qingdao epta vsd engineering george barker iarpitaly iarp asia misa cold service and epta
         international




         in the following years the group invested in refurbishing their facilities which soon became
         paragon factories this was acknowledged by the iso 14001 certification that epta milano
         costan epta france epta istanbul eurocryor george barker iarp asia iarp via enrico motta
         and cold service became awarded starting from 2011 epta france george barker iarp asia and
         epta milano eurocryor costan epta istanbul and cold service became ohsas 18001certified
         in the areas of occupational safety and health it has also been possible for those plants certified
         to all 3 management systems to integrate them into a single system in accordance with pas 99

         epta strongly believes in the value of certifications and has opted to be certified through a truly
         objective logic for its products too this is why epta outsources the assessment of its products
         to eurovent the agency used by the major manufacturers of refrigeration and air conditioning
         equipment eurovent independently checks the energy performance of the cabinets according
         to the international iso 2395312 standards

        the beneficial impact of ecofriendly logics
        eptas desire to practice sustainability with an authentic sense of
        responsibility is also put into concrete form in an environmental protection
        strategy a commitment that is reflected in every project in research and
        in the production processes from the design and development of the product
        up to the end of its service life a fundamental premise for putting this logic
        into action is the quantification and the certification of the potential
        environmental impact of the products and processes which the group has accompli
        shed by adopting the lca life cycle assessment method

energy conservation made real
epta is constantly seeking solutions to improve energy efficiency at the
groups plants opting for energy selfproduction like photovoltaic and co
generation systems and implementing advanced technology on manufactu
ring processes has resulted in improved general performance levels the koe
 kilogram of oil equivalent per manufactured unit  has dropped from 6175
in 2013 to 5440 in 2015 with a reduction exceeding 12 percentage points
the slight increase in koe as compared to 2014 can be explained by the ope
ning of the limana glass factory and the subsequent insourcing of some
activities that had previously been outsourced




                                                                                                       12

the groups effort also resulted in a reduction of water consumption applied both to
production and to water use across the facility the improvement is even more evident

in 2013 to 370 litres in 2015 with a decrease of over 32 percent
