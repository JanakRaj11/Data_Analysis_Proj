improvement of energy efficiency at onninen
finlands logistics sites
in 2011 an energy survey was carried out in onninen                          the energy survey enables onninen to allocate
finlands logistics sites the hattula steel service                          resources to the right measures in the hyvinkää
center and the hyvinkää distribution center the                              distribution center oil boilers were replaced with
aim of which was to identify development targets                              district heating and it has been planned to integrate
