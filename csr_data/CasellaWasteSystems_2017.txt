       2016 annual report

to our fellow shareholders
i am pleased to report that we continue to execute well against the
comprehensive business strategy and plan we adopted to improve
our financial and operating performance just over four years ago our
successful execution of this plan is driving improved financial results
and increasing shareholder returns it is truly an exciting time to be a
part of what we are accomplishing at casella

we have improved our financial and operating performance and reduced exposure to risk by divesting
or closing operations that did not fit well within our core strategy and by focusing our attention and
capital resources on core operations we believe that simplifying our business structure and focusing
on our core operations has resulted in our improved operational performance and provides a strong
backbone for additional value creation moving forward

the successful execution of our plan is clearly demonstrated in our improved financial performance

next steps continue to improve cash flow further
reducing leverage
we remain focused on improving cash flows and reducing debt leverage by targeting the following
strategic initiatives

  increasing landfill returns by driving pricing in excess of inflation in the disposal capacity
   constrained markets in the northeast and working to maximize capacity utilization

123115 and 69mm for the fiscal year ended 123116

 driving additional profitability in our collection operations through profitable revenue growth
  operating efficiencies and selling or swapping underperforming routes or operations

 creating incremental value through our resource solutions offerings in our recycling organics
  and customer solutions operations and

 improving our balance sheet and reducing risk through continued capital discipline and a focus
  on debt repayment with excess cash flows

increasing landfill returns
since we launched our strategy over four years ago we have increased annual landfill volumes
by approximately 779000 tons per year or 219 from the fiscal year ended april 30 2013 to
the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 fiscal year 2016 we have driven this volume growth
through implementing our focused landfill sales strategy building our special waste capabilities as
well as the positioning of our landfill assets in the marketplace

in midfiscal year 2016 we pivoted strategy in our western region to focus on pricing over volumes
at our landfills given this strategy adjustment and our continued success in the eastern region we
advanced landfill pricing by 21 in fiscal year 2016

we expect these positive trends to continue for us over the next several years as disposal capacity
constraints become more acute across our footprint and we remain focused on further improving
landfill returns

further we are deeply committed to develop and operate our landfill facilities to the highest
environmental standards while maintaining a strong partnership with each respective host
community this has been our recipe for success in developing longterm disposal assets in the
challenging northeast environment

driving additional profitability in collection operations
we continued to make great progress on our second major strategic initiative of driving additional
profitability in our collection operations our focus here is on core blockingandtackling namely a
focus on pricing route optimization fleet standardization and maintenance

we continued to advance pricing in the collection lineofbusiness in fiscal year 2016 with overall
pricing up 46 this was the strongest pricing execution that we have experienced in the last
ten years

on the operating side we have continued to advance a number of key areas to further improve our
operating costs in the collection lineofbusiness we are in the third year of our comprehensive fleet
plan which is designed to simplify our fleet and target truck replacements in order to maximize
returns reduce our operating expenses through lower maintenance costs and improve our service
levels through reduced down times

the combination of these operating advancements and pricing programs are driving improved
results in our collection lineofbusiness with our cost of operations as a percentage revenues down
640 basis points from the calendar year ended december 31 2014 to fiscal year 2016

creating incremental value through resource solutions
one of the key objectives of our strategy is to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by offering
valueadded resource solutions to our customers these solutions range from our customer solutions
business which provides professional services to large industrial customers to our organics
business which is the leader in organics processing and disposal in the northeast to our worldclass
recycling business

our customer solutions business continued to improve margins and returns in fiscal year 2016 as
we further transformed the business from the legacy brokerage model to a professional services
organization focused on providing resource solutions to large industrial and institutional accounts

in fiscal year 2016 our organics business effectively capitalized on the rapidly changing disposal
and regulatory environment for biosolids across the northeast by securing several new longterm
contracts and advancing pricing

over the last 18 months we have effectively reshaped our recycling business model to drive
higher returns in all market cycles and reduce commodity volatility we accomplished this goal
by restructuring a number of thirdparty processing contracts with higher tipping fees and with the
implementation of our sustainability recycling adjustment fee or sra fee the sra fee floats
inversely to changes in recycling commodity prices

our efforts have worked out extremely well and i am proud to say that we have improved operating
income and returns in the recycling business over the last two years despite the significant headwinds
that we faced from a commodity price standpoint

improving balance sheet and reducing risk
over the last four years we have made great progress towards improving our asset mix reducing risk
and improving financial performance by divesting noncore operations increasing our capital hurdle
rates and focusing capital investment into select core operations going forward we will continue
to focus in these key areas to drive additional shareholder value and to further reduce risk

in october 2016 we further reduced our balance sheet risk with the refinancing of our abl revolver
due 2020 and our 775 senior subordinated notes due 2019 with a new 160 million revolving
credit facility and a new 350 million term loan b facility collectively the credit facility
we believe that this transaction positions us well to continue to execute against our strategic plan by
reducing our cash interest costs by approximately 110 million per year by paying down our highest
cost junior debt improving our financial flexibility and extending debt maturities
over the last two fiscal years we have reduced our consolidated leverage ratio by 120x to 422x as
of december 31 2016 and paid down our longterm debt by 114 million2

while we still have work left to accomplish to further improve our operating performance and to
drive higher cash flows we are excited about our progress to date against our key strategies and we
believe that we are well positioned to further these efforts over the next several years

sincerely

strategy
our goal is to build a sustainable and profitable company by providing exemplary service to our customers while operating
safe and environmentally sound facilities over the last several years many of our customers have been seeking to reduce their
environmental footprint by increasing their recycling rates diverting organic materials out of the waste stream into beneficial
use processes and exploring emerging methods to transform traditional waste streams into renewable resources since we first
began operating in vermont in 1975 our business strategy has been firmly tied to creating a sustainable resource management
model and we continue to be rooted in these same tenets today we strive to create longterm value for all of our stakeholders
including customers employees communities and shareholders
our primary objective is to maximize longterm shareholder value through a combination of financial performance and
strategic asset positioning annually we complete a comprehensive strategic planning process to assess and refine our strategic
objectives in the context of our asset mix and the current market environment this process helps the management team
allocate resources to a range of business opportunities in order to strive to maximize longterm financial returns and
competitive positioning
over the last four years we have made significant progress in simplifying our business structure improving cash flows and
reducing risk exposure by divesting and closing under performing operations that did not enhance or complement our core
operations specifically we have had success over the last four years improving our financial performance and driving positive
cash flows by advancing efforts in four key areas 1 increasing landfill returns 2 driving additional profitability at collection
operations 3 creating incremental value through resource solutions and 4 improving our balance sheet and reducing
business risk we plan to continue to focus our efforts in these areas in the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 to support
our efforts we continue to invest in our employees through leadership development technical training and incentive
compensation structures that seek to align our employees incentives with our longterm goal to improve cash flows and returns
on invested capital
increasing landfill returns
we launched a strategic initiative in fiscal year 2014 to source incremental waste volumes to our landfills to maximize annual
capacity utilization and increase cash flows our goal was to increase waste volumes by 05 million tons annually to our
landfills by the end of fiscal year 2015 as of december 31 2015 we had exceeded this goal and overall landfill volumes for
fiscal year 2016 were up by approximately 08 million tons per year compared to the twelve months ended december 31 2012
excluding volumes from the worcester massachusetts landfill worcester landfill closure project in massachusetts
landfill waste volume increases have been primarily driven by 1 our success in acquiring new transfer station and hauling
customers 2 our focused landfill sales strategy which included the revamping of our special waste team to focus on sourcing
additional industrial and remediation waste volumes 3 increasing cd volumes as the construction market has slowly
rebounded across our market areas and 4 our asset positioning in several key markets that have contracting permitted
capacity




                                                                  4

                                                                                                                                         4

    disposal market dynamics have quickly shifted across our footprint due to improving macroeconomic conditions and a
    challenging regulatory environment for new disposal capacity in total facilities that we estimate had approximately 17 million
    tons of annual disposal capacity have permanently closed in massachusetts maine new hampshire and vermont over the last
    several years and we expect that facilities with another 12 million tons of additional annual capacity will permanently close
    over the next several years these closures and expected closures represent a reduction of over 20 of total market capacity
    across these states furthermore we expect that waste flow shifts in new york state and additional facility closures in
    contiguous markets will keep more waste volumes in the market for ultimate disposal over the next 20 years further tightening
    available market capacity
    given this backdrop we shifted our landfill strategy in transition period 2014 to balance sourcing additional volumes against
    improving pricing and returns at our landfills while we believe it will take several years for the capacity constraints in our
    markets to become acute we experienced tightening pricing elasticity in our markets over the last year which has enabled us to
    begin increasing disposal prices in excess of the consumer price index in several of our markets in fiscal year 2016 we
    increased our overall landfill price by 21 over the prior year as we selectively increased tipping fees
    we continue to work on strategies to source additional waste volumes to our landfills by increasing our geographic reach
    through the use of rail transportation and accessing new endmarkets
    driving additional profitability at collection operations
    over the last four years we have developed and implemented a number of programs designed to improve profitability and
    returns in the collection lineofbusiness including pricing yield analytics new sales force incentives route profitability
    analytics onroute sales and marketing initiatives a comprehensive fleet strategy and selling or swapping under performing
    routes or operations
    our local collection teams have moved pricing from an annual process to a core process that is continually reviewed and
    adjusted throughout the year our division management and sales teams use our customer profitability analytics tool to
    calculate customer level profitability and increase pricing where appropriate to offset cost increases we continue to yield
    success from our collection pricing programs with commercial and residential collection price growth of 49 in fiscal year
    2016
    in fiscal year 2015 we implemented the sustainability recycling adjustment fee sra fee to dynamically adjust residential
    and commercial collection pricing for monthly changes in recycling commodity prices the sra fee has been well received by
    our customers and is helping to offset commodity price headwinds
    during fiscal year 2014 we adjusted our sales force incentive compensation program to better support our efforts to drive
    responsibility to the local operating level we introduced a uniform commission structure tracking and payment system to help
    our local teams administer customized commission structures for each sales representative while maintaining a consistent
    system to track performance
    collection routes are the basic building blocks of our solid waste business and we believe that it is imperative that we seek to
    ensure that each route is profitable and covers the cost of truck and container capital in order to achieve this goal we have
    developed and implemented a route profitability tool to help our operating teams analyze and improve their routing
    productivity and profitability with the help of this tool we have increased the frequency of rerouting existing customers to
    improve efficiencies and take trucks off the road in addition we routinely evaluate on an accountbyaccount basis existing
    customer service levels service types equipment selection and truck type selection to seek to ensure that we are maximizing
    profitability and asset utilization to further improve route density we focus our marketing and sales efforts on existing routes
    to augment our operating efforts we implemented a fiveyear comprehensive fleet plan during transition period 2014 to define
    our fleet standards and specifically target truck replacements to maximize returns we believe that this plan will help us to
    reduce our operating costs and improve our capital efficiency by reducing downtime and maintenance costs and improving
    service levels
    differentiating business with resource solutions
    to complement our traditional solid waste offerings we have developed a set of resource solutions and invested in select assets
    that are intended to enhance our ability to support emerging customer and market needs our resource solutions strategy seeks
    to leverage our core competencies across our operating segments in materials processing industrial recycling clean energy and
    organics service offerings in order to generate additional value from the waste stream for our customers in fiscal year 2016
    264 of our revenues were generated by our recycling customer solutions and organics businesses in the aggregate




                                                                     5

for nearly 40 years we have been a leader in providing recycling services to our customers we currently own or operate six
material recovery facilities mrfs that use our zerosort recycling process which we own or operate under longterm
operating agreements with zerosort recycling customers can commingle all of their recyclables paper cardboard plastics
metals and glass into a single rightsized residential or commercial container by making it easier for a customer to recycle
we have increased recycling participation and yields thereby increasing volumes through our mrfs and enhancing asset
utilization
the average mix of recycling commodities generated by residential and commercial customers has historically sold at an
average price that covered the cost of processing the materials including an adequate return on our investment in the
processing equipment facilities and rolling stock necessary to process the recyclables from early 2011 to the end of fiscal
year 2015 recycling commodity prices declined by approximately 60 to historically low levels as global demand for fiber
and metal materials significantly dropped and plastics pricing declined with lower crude oil pricing
at these low recycling commodity pricing levels we were not able to generate adequate revenue from the sale of commodities
to cover the cost of processing the materials or generating a positive return on our investment in recycling infrastructure in
order to continue to provide these necessary services to our residential commercial municipal and industrial customers we
changed our pricing model for these services by introducing the sra fee in fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016
our customer solutions business works with our industrial services including multilocation customers colleges and
universities municipalities and industrial customers to develop customized comprehensive solid waste solutions the focus of
this group is to help these large scale organizations achieve waste reduction and diversion goals to meet their economic and
environmental objectives we believe that we differentiate our services from our competitors by providing a personalized set of
resource solutions which enables us to win new business including traditional solid waste collection and disposal customers
our organics business provides transportation disposal and resource solutions to waste water treatment facilities across the
northeast in fiscal year 2016 our operations managed approximately 08 million tons of residuals with 02 million tons of this
material internalized to our landfills and 04 million tons transformed into renewable products for fertilization and landscaping
in addition our organics group has been working to develop andor partner with firms that have developed innovative
approaches to deriving incremental value from source separated organics to comply with emerging waste regulations
improving our balance sheet and reducing business risk
we believe we are making excellent progress improving our balance sheet and reducing operational and financial risk one of
the key pillars of this initiative is our enterprise risk management program that helps us to more effectively identify and
mitigate risk throughout all aspects of our business this program has helped us to prioritize and focus resources on mitigating
key risk areas
during fiscal year 2016 our financial strategy was focused on maximizing cash flows to permanently retire indebtedness and
refinancing higher cost indebtedness to lower our borrowing costs and reduce market risk we made significant progress in
each area during fiscal year 2016
     on october 17 2016 we completed the refinancing of our 775 senior subordinated notes due february 2019 2019
      notes and our senior secured assetbased revolving credit and letter of credit facility due february 2020 abl
      facility with our new term loan b facility in the amount of 3500 million term loan b facility and a revolving
      line of credit facility in the amount of 1600 million revolving credit facility and together with the term loan b
      facility the credit facility this refinancing is expected to save us approximately 110 million of annual cash
      interest expense move out debt maturities and increase our financial flexibility
     over the last two years we have both paid down our longterm debt and reduced our consolidated leverage ratio as we
      have focused capital strategy on improving our balance sheet as of december 31 2016 our consolidated leverage ratio
      as measured by our credit facility was 422x see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial
      condition and results of operations in this annual report on form 10k for further disclosure over the calculation of
      our maximum consolidated net leverage ratio as of december 31 2016
over the last four years we have made significant progress in simplifying our business structure improving cash flows and
reducing risk exposure by divesting and closing under performing operations that did not enhance or complement our core
operations these actions included 1 the divestiture of maine energy recovery company lp maine energy a low
margin negative cash flow wastetoenergy operation in the fiscal year ended april 30 2013 2 the divestiture of kti
biofuels inc biofuels a low margin negative cash flow cd processing facility in fiscal year 2014 3 the sale of our
50 equity interest in us greenfiber llc greenfiber a negative cash flow cellulose insulation jointventure in fiscal
year 2014 4 the wind down of casellaaltela regional environmental services llc cares through the disposal of the
remaining assets of cares in fiscal year 2015 in which we held a 51 membership interest and 5 the sale of select low
margin collection routes in fiscal years 2015 and 2016


                                                                6

                                                                                                                                     6

    we believe that we are wellpositioned for the future and remain strongly committed to a disciplined capital investment
    strategy with excess cash flow expected to be primarily used to repay indebtedness further we continue to actively review our
    business portfolio for opportunities to improve financial performance by swapping or selling underperforming operations or
    making selective tuckin acquisitions to improve route density or internalization
    operational overview
    our solid waste and recycling operations comprise a full range of nonhazardous solid waste services including collections
    transfer stations mrfs and disposal facilities
    collections a majority of our commercial and industrial collection services are performed under onetofive year service
    agreements with prices and fees determined by such factors as collection frequency type of equipment and containers
    furnished type volume and weight of solid waste collected distance to the disposal or processing facility and cost of disposal
    or processing our residential collection and disposal services are performed either on a subscription basis with no underlying
    contract with individuals or through contracts with municipalities homeowner associations apartment building owners or
    mobile home park operators
    transfer stations our transfer stations receive compact and transfer solid waste collected primarily by our various residential
    and commercial collection operations for transport to disposal facilities by larger vehicles we believe that transfer stations
    benefit us by 1 increasing the size of the wastesheds which have access to our landfills 2 reducing costs by improving
    utilization of collection personnel and equipment and 3 helping us build relationships with municipalities and other
    customers by providing a local physical presence and enhanced local service capabilities
    material recovery facilities our mrfs receive sort bale and sell recyclable materials originating from the municipal solid
    waste stream including newsprint cardboard office paper glass plastic steel or aluminum containers and bottles we operate
    eight mrfs within our recycling region in geographic areas served by our collection divisions revenues are received from
    municipalities and customers in the form of processing fees tipping fees and commodity sales these mrfs three of which are
    located in new york two of which are located in vermont two of which are located in massachusetts and one of which is
    located in maine are largescale highvolume facilities that process over 05 million tons per year of recycled materials
    delivered to them by municipalities and commercial customers under longterm contracts we also operate smaller mrfs
    which generally process recyclables collected from our various residential collection operations
    landfills we operate nine solid waste subtitle d landfills and one landfill permitted to accept cd materials revenues are
    received from municipalities and other customers in the form of tipping fees the estimated capacity at our landfills is subject
    to change based on engineering factors requirements of regulatory authorities our ability to continue to operate our landfills in
    compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at
    our sites

  2 represents capacity which we have determined to be permittable in accordance with the following criteria i we
      control the land on which the expansion is sought ii all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been
      obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained iii we have not identified any legal or political impediments which
      we believe will not be resolved in our favor iv we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we
      expect that all required permits will be received and v senior management has approved the project
  3 the change in new expansions pursued airspace capacity in fiscal year 2015 relates to the determination of additional
      permittable airspace at southbridge landfill and nces landfill in our eastern region
  4 the increase in remaining permitted airspace capacity in fiscal year 2016 was a result of the receipt of expansion permits
      at chemung county landfill and ontario county landfill in our western region the increase in remaining permitted
      airspace capacity in transition period 2014 was the result of a permit received at nces landfill in our eastern region
  5 the variation in changes in airspace capacity associated with engineering estimates are primarily the result of changes in
      compaction at our landfills and estimated airspace changes associated with design changes at certain of our landfills

    to the oil and gas industry that explores natural gas in the marcellus shale of pennsylvania in the form of disposal capacity for
    residual materials
    closed landfills
    we also own andor manage five unlined landfills and three lined landfills that are not currently in operation we have closed
    and capped all of these landfills according to applicable environmental regulatory standards
    operating segments
    we manage our solid waste operations which include a full range of solid waste services on a geographic basis through two
    regional operating segments which we designate as our eastern and western regions our third operating segment is
    recycling which comprises our largerscale recycling operations and our commodity brokerage operations organic services
    ancillary operations industrial services discontinued operations and earnings from equity method investees as applicable are
    included in our other segment see note 19 segment reporting to our consolidated financial statements included under
    item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for a summary of revenues certain expenses profitability capital expenditures
    goodwill and total assets of our operating segments
    within each geographic region we organize our solid waste services around smaller areas that we refer to as wastesheds a
    wasteshed is an area that comprises the complete cycle of activities in the solid waste services process from collection to
    transfer operations and recycling to disposal in landfills some of which may be owned and or operated by third parties we
    typically operate several divisions within each wasteshed each of which provides a particular service such as collection
    recycling disposal or transfer each division operates interdependently with the other divisions within the wasteshed each
    wasteshed generally operates autonomously from adjoining wastesheds




                                                                      9

through the eight mrfs and commodity brokerage operation comprising our recycling segment we provide services to six
anchor contracts which have original terms ranging from five to twenty years and expire at various times through calendar year
end 2028 the terms of each contract vary but all of the contracts provide that the municipality or thirdparty delivers materials
to our facility these contracts may include a minimum volume guarantee by the municipality we also have service agreements
with individual towns and cities and commercial customers including small solid waste companies and major competitors that
do not have processing capacity within a specific geographic region

see our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for our financial results
for fiscal year 2016 fiscal year 2015 transition period 2014 and fiscal year 2014 and our financial position as of december 31
2016 and december 31 2015
eastern region
our eastern region consists of wastesheds located in maine northern central and southeastern new hampshire and central and
eastern massachusetts our eastern region is vertically integrated with transfer landfill processing and recycling assets
serviced by our collection operations in february 2013 we aligned management of nces landfill with our eastern region
nces landfill had been historically aligned with our western region our december 2012 acquisition of bestway disposal
services and bbi waste services strengthened both our collection and transfer network in new hampshire and maine by
adding three collection operations and four either owned or operated transfer stations and by contributing additional
internalized solid waste and recycling volumes to our disposal facilities in august 2013 we divested of our biofuels cd
processing facility in lewiston maine allowing us to focus on our higher margin core businesses
we entered the maine market in 1996 and have grown organically and through acquisitions in 2004 we obtained the right to
operate juniper ridge landfill under a 30year agreement with the state of maine
we entered the southern new hampshire market in 1999 and the eastern massachusetts market in 2000 and since have grown
organically and through acquisitions in this market we rely to a large extent on thirdparty disposal capacity but nces
landfill southbridge landfill and other assets have provided additional opportunities to internalize volumes in december
2013 we acquired a transfer station in oxford massachusetts allowing greater operational flexibility for our solid waste and
recycling collection operations
western region
our western region includes wastesheds located in vermont southwestern new hampshire eastern western and upstate new
york and in pennsylvania around mckean landfill the portion of eastern new york served by our western region includes
clinton operation of clinton county franklin essex warren washington saratoga rennselaer and albany counties
our western region also consists of wastesheds in western new york which includes ithaca elmira oneonta lowville
potsdam geneva auburn dunkirk jamestown and olean markets we entered these wastesheds in 1997 and have expanded
primarily through tuckin acquisitions and organic growth our western region collection operations include leadership
positions in nearly every rural market outside of the larger metropolitan markets such as syracuse rochester buffalo and
albany
we remain focused on increasing our vertical integration in our western region through extension of our reach into new
markets and managing new materials we believe that maximizing these logistics through the use of rail if implemented long
haul trucks and trailer tippers at our facilities will increase our reach




                                                                10

     recycling
     our recycling segment is one of the largest processors and marketers of recycled materials in the northeastern united states
     comprised of eight mrfs that process and market recyclable materials that municipalities and commercial customers deliver
     under longterm contracts two of the eight mrfs are leased three are owned and three are operated by us under contracts
     with municipal thirdparties in fiscal year 2016 the recycling segment processed andor marketed over 07 million tons of
     recyclable materials including tons marketed through our commodity brokerage division and our baling facilities located
     throughout our footprint recyclings facilities are located in vermont new york maine and massachusetts
     a substantial portion of the material provided to recycling is delivered pursuant to six anchor contracts the anchor contracts
     have an original term of five to twenty years and expire at various times through 2028 the terms of the recycling contracts
     vary but all of the contracts provide that the municipality or a thirdparty delivers the recycled materials to our facility under
     the recycling contracts we charge the municipality a fee for each ton of material delivered to us some contracts contain
     revenue sharing arrangements under which the municipality receives a specified percentage of our revenues from the sale of the
     recovered materials
     our recycling segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from the sale of recyclable materials since purchase and
     sale prices of recyclable materials particularly newspaper corrugated containers plastics ferrous and aluminum can fluctuate
     based upon market conditions we use longterm supply contracts with customers to reduce commodity risk under such
     contracts we obtain a guaranteed minimum price for recyclable materials through the receipt of a tipping fee when commodity
     prices fall below agreed upon thresholds conversely when prices for recyclable materials rise above agreed upon thresholds
     we provide the counterparty with a portion of the related revenues the contracts are generally with large domestic companies
     that use the recyclable materials in their manufacturing process such as paper packaging and consumer goods companies in
     fiscal year 2016 307 of the revenues from the sale of residential recyclable materials were derived from sales under long
     term contracts at times we also hedge against fluctuations in the commodity prices of recycled paper and corrugated
     containers in order to mitigate the variability in cash flows and earnings generated from the sales of recycled materials at
     floating prices as of december 31 2016 no such commodity hedges were in place also we mitigate the impact from
     commodity price fluctuations through the use of a floating sra fee charged to collection customers to offtake recycling
     commodity risk
     other
     our other segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from our customer solutions and organics businesses our
     resource solutions strategy seeks to leverage our core competencies in materials processing industrial recycling clean energy
     and organics service offerings in order to generate additional value from the waste stream for our customers our customer
     solutions business works with larger scale organizations including multilocation customers colleges and universities
     municipalities and industrial customers to develop customized solid waste solutions the focus of this business is to help these
     large scale organizations achieve waste reduction and diversion goals to meet their economic and environmental objectives we
     differentiate our services from our competitors by providing a customized set of comprehensive resource solutions which
     enables us to win new business including traditional solid waste collection and disposal customers
     our organics business has been working to develop andor partner with firms that have developed innovative approaches to
     deriving incremental value from the organic portion of the waste stream through our earthlife soils products we offer a wide
     array of organic fertilizers composts and mulches that help our customers recycle organic waste streams we also have
     ownership interests in agreen energy llc agreen and bgreen energy llc bgreen which we account for as cost
     method investments that partner with other capital investors to build farmbased anaerobic digesters in the northeast to
     generate electricity from farm and food waste streams
     competition
     the solid waste services industry is highly competitive we compete for collection and disposal volume primarily on the basis
     of the quality breadth and price of our services from time to time competitors may reduce the price of their services in an
     effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract these practices may also lead to reduced
     pricing for our services or the loss of business in addition competition exists within the industry for potential acquisition
     candidates
     the larger urban markets in which we compete are served by one or more of the large national solid waste companies
     including waste management inc republic services inc and waste connections inc that are able to achieve greater
     economies of scale than we can we also compete with a number of regional and local companies that offer competitive prices
     and quality service in addition we compete with operators of alternative disposal facilities including incinerators and with
     certain municipalities counties and districts that operate their own solid waste collection and disposal facilities public sector
     facilities may have certain advantages over us due to the availability of user fees charges or tax revenues and taxexempt
     financing

                                                                      11

employees
as of january 31 2017 we employed approximately 2000 people including approximately 400 professionals or managers
sales clerical information systems or other administrative employees and approximately 1600 employees involved in
collection transfer disposal recycling or other operations approximately 100 of our employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements we believe relations with our employees are good

we actively maintain environmental and other risk management programs that we believe are appropriate for our business our
environmental risk management program includes evaluating existing facilities as well as potential acquisitions for
compliance with environmental law requirements we also maintain a worker safety program which focuses on safe practices
in the workplace operating practices at all of our operations are intended to reduce the possibility of environmental
contamination enforcement actions and litigation
we carry a range of insurance intended to protect our assets and operations including a commercial general liability policy and
a property damage policy a partially or completely uninsured claim against us including liabilities associated with cleanup or
remediation at our facilities if successful and of sufficient magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business
financial condition and results of operations any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure
future contracts which may be conditioned upon the availability of adequate insurance coverage
we selfinsure for automobile and workers compensation coverage with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure
our maximum exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the workers compensation plan was 10 million per individual event our
maximum exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the automobile plan was 12 million per individual event
municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill closure and postclosure obligations may require performance or surety
bonds letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure contractual performance while we have not experienced
difficulty in obtaining these financial instruments if we are unable to obtain these financial instruments in sufficient amounts or
at acceptable rates we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal contracts or obtaining or retaining landfill
operating permits
we hold a 199 ownership interest in evergreen national indemnity company evergreen a surety company which
provides surety bonds to secure our contractual obligations for certain municipal solid waste collection contracts and landfill
closure and postclosure obligations our ownership interest in evergreen is pledged to evergreen as security for our
obligations under the bonds they provide on our behalf
customers
we provide our collection services to commercial institutional industrial and residential customers a majority of our
commercial and industrial collection services are performed under onetofive year service agreements and fees are determined
by such factors as professional or management services required collection frequency type of equipment and containers
furnished the type volume and weight of the solid waste collected the distance to the disposal or processing facility and the
cost of disposal or processing our residential collection and disposal services are performed either on a subscription basis
with no underlying contract with individuals or through contracts with municipalities homeowners associations apartment
owners or mobile home park operators



                                                                12

                                                                                                                                       12

     our recycling segment provides recycling services to municipalities commercial haulers and commercial waste generators
     within the geographic proximity of the processing facilities
     seasonality and severe weather
     our transfer and disposal revenues historically have been higher in the late spring summer and early fall months this
     seasonality reflects lower volumes of waste in the late fall winter and early spring months because
          the volume of waste relating to cd activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern
           united states and
          decreased tourism in vermont new hampshire maine and eastern new york during the winter months tends to lower
           the volume of waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers which is partially offset by increased volume
           from the ski industry
     because certain of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year operating income is therefore
     impacted by a similar seasonality our operations can also be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather
     which could increase our operating costs associated with the collection and disposal of waste delay the collection and disposal
     of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites increase the volume of waste collected under our existing
     contracts without corresponding compensation decrease the throughput and operating efficiency of our materials recycling
     facilities or delay construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities our operations can also be favorably
     affected by severe weather which could increase the volume of waste in situations where we are able to charge for our
     additional services provided
     our recycling segment experiences increased volumes of fiber in november and december due to increased newspaper
     advertising and retail activity during the holiday season
     regulation
     introduction
     we are subject to extensive federal state and local environmental laws and regulations which have become increasingly
     stringent in recent years the environmental regulations affecting us are administered by the united states environmental
     protection agency epa and other federal state and local environmental zoning health and safety agencies failure to
     comply with such requirements could result in substantial costs including civil and criminal fines and penalties except as
     described in this annual report on form 10k we believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable
     federal state and local environmental laws permits orders and regulations other than as disclosed herein we do not currently
     anticipate any material costs to bring our existing operations into environmental compliance although there can be no
     assurance in this regard for the future we expect that our operations in the solid waste services industry will be subject to
     continued and increased regulation legislation and enforcement oversight we attempt to anticipate future legal and regulatory
     requirements and to keep our operations in compliance with those requirements
     in order to transport process or dispose of solid waste it is necessary for us to possess and comply with one or more permits
     from federal state andor local agencies we must renew these permits periodically and the permits may be modified or
     revoked by the issuing agency under certain circumstances
     the principal federal statutes and regulations applicable to our operations are as follows
     the resource conservation and recovery act of 1976 as amended rcra
     the rcra regulates the generation treatment storage handling transportation and disposal of solid waste and requires states
     to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste the rcra divides waste into two categories hazardous and
     nonhazardous wastes are generally classified as hazardous if they either a are specifically included on a list of hazardous
     wastes or b exhibit certain characteristics defined as hazardous and are not specifically designated as nonhazardous wastes
     classified as hazardous waste are subject to more extensive regulation than wastes classified as nonhazardous and businesses
     that deal with hazardous waste are subject to regulatory obligations in addition to those imposed on businesses that deal with
     nonhazardous waste
     among the wastes that are specifically designated as nonhazardous are household waste and special waste including items
     such as petroleum contaminated soils asbestos foundry sand shredder fluff and most nonhazardous industrial waste products




                                                                     13

the epa regulations issued under subtitle c of the rcra impose a comprehensive cradle to grave system for tracking the
generation transportation treatment storage and disposal of hazardous wastes subtitle c regulations impose obligations on
generators transporters and disposers of hazardous wastes and require permits that are costly to obtain and maintain for sites
where those businesses treat store or dispose of such material subtitle c requirements include detailed operating inspection
training and emergency preparedness and response standards as well as requirements for manifesting record keeping and
reporting corrective action facility closure postclosure and financial responsibility most states have promulgated regulations
modeled on some or all of the subtitle c provisions issued by the epa and in many instances the epa has delegated to those
states the principal role in regulating businesses which are subject to those requirements some state regulations impose
obligations different from and in addition to those the epa imposes under subtitle c
leachate generated at our landfills and transfer stations is tested on a regular basis and generally is not regulated as a
hazardous waste under federal law however there is no guarantee that leachate generated from our facilities in the future will
not be classified as hazardous waste
in october 1991 the epa adopted the subtitle d regulations under rcra governing solid waste landfills the subtitle d
regulations which generally became effective in october 1993 include siting restrictions facility design standards operating
criteria closure and postclosure requirements financial assurance requirements groundwater monitoring requirements
groundwater remediation standards and corrective action requirements in addition the subtitle d regulations require that new
landfill sites meet more stringent liner design criteria typically composite soil and synthetic liners or two or more synthetic
liners intended to keep leachate out of groundwater and have extensive collection systems to carry away leachate for treatment
prior to disposal regulations generally require us to install groundwater monitoring wells at virtually all landfills we operate
to monitor groundwater quality and indirectly the effectiveness of the leachate collection systems the subtitle d regulations
also require facility owners or operators to control emissions of landfill gas including methane generated at landfills
exceeding certain regulatory thresholds state landfill regulations must meet those requirements or the epa will impose such
requirements upon landfill owners and operators in that state
the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended clean water act
the clean water act regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the united states from a variety of sources
including solid waste disposal sites and transfer stations processing facilities and wastetoenergy facilities collectively solid
waste management facilities if runoff or treated leachate from our solid waste management facilities is discharged into
streams rivers or other surface waters the clean water act would require us to apply for and obtain a discharge permit
conduct sampling and monitoring and under certain circumstances reduce the quantity of pollutants in such discharge a
permit also may be required if that runoff or leachate is discharged to an offsite treatment facility almost all solid waste
management facilities must comply with the epas storm water regulations which govern the discharge of regulated storm
water to surface waters
under federal regulation facilities that have above ground andor below ground petroleum storage capacities over certain
thresholds may be subject to regulations andor permitting under the clean water act many of our facilities have petroleum
storage and are required to have a spill prevention control and countermeasures spcc plan to prevent petroleum release to
waters of the us due to a spill rupture or leak
several states in which we operate have been delegated the authority to implement the clean water act requirements and in
some cases the regulations are more stringent than the federal regulations we believe we are in compliance with the clean
water act regulations however future changes to the law or regulations could have a material impact on our business




                                                                  14

                                                                                                                                         14

     the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla
     cercla established a regulatory and remedial program intended to provide for the investigation and remediation of facilities
     where or from which a release of any hazardous substance into the environment has occurred or is threatened cercla has
     been interpreted to impose retroactive strict and under certain circumstances joint and severable liability for the costs to
     investigate and clean up facilities on current owners and operators of the site former owners and operators of the site at the
     time of the disposal of the hazardous substances as well as the generators and certain transporters of the hazardous substances
     cercla imposes liability for the costs of evaluating and addressing damage to natural resources the costs of cercla
     investigation and cleanup can be substantial liability under cercla does not depend upon the existence or disposal of
     hazardous waste as defined by rcra but can be based on the presence of any of more than 700 hazardous substances
     listed by the epa many of which can be found in household waste the definition of hazardous substances in cercla
     incorporates substances designated as hazardous or toxic under the federal clean water act clean air act and toxic
     substances control act tsca if we were found to be a responsible party for a cercla cleanup under certain
     circumstances the enforcing agency could pursue us or any other responsible party for all investigative and remedial costs
     even if others also were liable cercla also authorizes the epa to impose a lien in favor of the united states upon all real
     property subject to or affected by a remedial action for all costs for which the property owner is liable cercla provides a
     responsible party with the right to bring a contribution action against other responsible parties for their allocable share of
     investigative and remedial costs our ability to obtain reimbursement for amounts we pay in excess of our allocable share of
     such costs would be limited by our ability to identify and locate other responsible parties and to prove the extent of their
     responsibility and by the financial resources of such other parties
     the clean air act of 1970 as amended clean air act
     the clean air act generally through state implementation of federal requirements regulates emissions of air pollutants from
     certain landfills based upon the date the landfill was constructed the total capacity of the landfill and the annual volume of
     emissions the epa has promulgated new source performance standards regulating air emissions of certain regulated pollutants
     nonmethane organic compounds from municipal solid waste landfills landfills located in areas where ambient levels of
     regulated pollutants exceed certain thresholds may be subject to more extensive air pollution controls and emission limitations
     in addition the epa has issued standards regulating the disposal of asbestoscontaining materials under the clean air act
     the epa is also focusing on the emissions of greenhouse gases or ghg including carbon dioxide and methane in december
     2009 the epa issued its endangerment finding that carbon dioxide poses a threat to human health and welfare providing the
     basis for the epa to regulate ghg emissions in december 2009 the epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases
     rule went into effect requiring facilities that emit twentyfive thousand metric tons or more per year of ghg emissions to
     submit annual reports to the epa
     in june 2010 the epa issued the socalled ghg tailoring rule which described how certain sources that emit ghg would
     be subject to heightened clean air act psd  title v regulation in july 2011 however the epa promulgated a rule that
     broadly deferred for three years the applicability of those regulations with regard to sources emitting carbon dioxide from
     biomassfired and other biogenic sources in june 2014 the us supreme court issued a decision partially invalidating
     epas tailoring rule we do not know whether or when the epa will put those regulations in place following the supreme
     court decision or what obligations such regulations will impose on our operations
     the adoption of other laws and regulations which may include the imposition of fees or taxes could adversely affect our
     collection and disposal operations additionally certain of the states in which we operate are contemplating air pollution
     control regulations including state or regional cap and trade systems relating to ghg that may be more stringent than
     regulations the epa may promulgate changing environmental regulations could require us to take any number of actions
     including purchasing emission allowances or installing additional pollution control technology and could make some
     operations less profitable which could adversely affect our results of operations
     congress has considered various options including a cap and trade system which could impose a limit on and establish a
     pricing mechanism for ghg emissions and emission allowances there also is pressure for the united states to join
     international efforts to control ghg emissions
     the clean air act regulates emissions of air pollutants from our processing facilities the epa has enacted standards that apply
     to those emissions it is possible that the epa or a state where we operate will enact additional or different emission standards
     in the future
     all of the federal statutes described above authorize lawsuits by private citizens to enforce certain provisions of the statutes in
     addition to a penalty award to the united states some of those statutes authorize an award of attorneys fees to private parties
     successfully advancing such an action




                                                                      15

the occupational safety and health act of 1970 as amended osha
osha establishes employer responsibilities and authorizes the occupational safety and health administration to promulgate
and enforce occupational health and safety standards including the obligation to maintain a workplace free of recognized
hazards likely to cause death or serious injury to comply with adopted worker protection standards to maintain certain records
to provide workers with required disclosures and to implement certain health and safety training programs a variety of those
promulgated standards may apply to our operations including those standards concerning notices of hazards safety in
excavation and demolition work the handling of asbestos and asbestoscontaining materials and worker training and
emergency response programs
the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended purpa
purpa exempts qualifying facilities from most federal and state laws governing the financial organization and rate regulation
of electric utilities and generally requires electric utilities to purchase electricity generated by qualifying facilities at a price
equal to the utilitys full avoided cost our four landfill gastoenergy facilities are self certified as qualifying facilities
state and local regulations
each state in which we now operate or may operate in the future has laws and regulations governing 1 water and air pollution
and the generation storage treatment handling processing transportation incineration and disposal of solid waste and
hazardous waste 2 in most cases the siting design operation maintenance closure and postclosure maintenance of solid
waste management facilities and 3 in some cases vehicle emissions limits or fuel types which impact our collection
operations such standards typically are as stringent as and may be more stringent and broader in scope than federal
regulations most of the federal statutes noted above authorize states to enact and enforce laws with standards that are more
protective of the environment than the federal analog in addition many states have adopted statutes comparable to and in
some cases more stringent than cercla those statutes impose requirements for investigation and remediation of
contaminated sites and liability for costs and damages associated with such sites and some authorize the state to impose liens
to secure costs expended addressing contamination on property owned by responsible parties some of those liens may take
priority over previously filed instruments some states have enacted statutes that impose liability for substances in addition to
the hazardous substances listed by epa under cercla
many municipalities in which we currently operate or may operate in the future also have ordinances laws and regulations
affecting our operations these include zoning and health measures that limit solid waste management activities to specified
sites or conduct flow control provisions that direct the delivery of solid wastes to specific facilities or to facilities in specific
areas laws that grant the right to establish franchises for collection services and then put out for bid the right to provide
collection services and bans or other restrictions on the movement of solid wastes into a municipality
some states have enacted laws that allow agencies with jurisdiction over waste management facilities to deny or revoke permits
based on the applicants or permit holders compliance status some states also consider the compliance history of the corporate
parent subsidiaries and affiliates of the applicant or permit holder
certain permits and approvals issued under state or local law may limit the types of waste that may be accepted at a solid waste
management facility or the quantity of waste that may be accepted at a solid waste management facility during a specific time
period in addition certain permits and approvals as well as certain state and local regulations may limit a solid waste
management facility to accepting waste that originates from specified geographic areas or seek to restrict the importation of
outofstate waste or otherwise discriminate against outofstate waste generally restrictions on importing outofstate waste
have not withstood judicial challenge however from time to time federal legislation is proposed which would allow individual
states to prohibit the disposal of outofstate waste or to limit the amount of outofstate waste that could be imported for
disposal and would require states under certain circumstances to reduce the amounts of waste exported to other states
although such legislation has not been passed by congress if similar legislation is enacted states in which we operate solid
waste management facilities could limit or prohibit the importation of outofstate waste such actions could materially and
adversely affect the business financial condition and results of operations of any of our landfills within those states that receive
a significant portion of waste originating from outofstate




                                                                   16

                                                                                                                                         16

     certain states and localities may restrict the export of waste from their jurisdiction or require that a specified amount of waste
     be disposed of at facilities within their jurisdiction in 1994 the us supreme court rejected as unconstitutional and therefore
     invalid a local ordinance that sought to limit waste going out of the locality by imposing a requirement that the waste be
     delivered to a particular privatelyowned facility however in 2007 the us supreme court upheld a us district court ruling
     that the flow control regulations in oneida and herkimer counties in new york requiring trash haulers to use publiclyowned
     transfer stations are constitutional and therefore valid additionally certain state and local jurisdictions continue to seek to
     enforce such restrictions some proposed federal legislation would allow states and localities to impose flow restrictions those
     restrictions could reduce the volume of waste going to solid waste management facilities in certain areas which may materially
     adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities andor affect the prices we can charge for certain services those restrictions
     also may result in higher disposal costs for our collection operations flow control restrictions could have a material adverse
     effect on our business financial condition and results of operations
     there has been an increasing trend at the state and local levels to mandate or encourage both waste reduction at the source and
     waste recycling and to prohibit or restrict the disposal in landfills of certain types of solid wastes including yard wastes and
     leaves certain construction or architectural wastes food wastes beverage containers newspapers household appliances and
     electronics such as computers and batteries regulations reducing the volume and types of wastes available for transport to and
     disposal in landfills could affect our ability to operate our landfill facilities vermont for example enacted act 148 containing
     among other things a phased waste ban for recyclables organics and leafyard waste the law became effective july 1 2012
     with phased deadlines for compliance beginning 2014 through 2020 vermont also passed a law requiring recycling of
     architectural waste from construction or demolition of a commercial project the law became effective in january 2015
     massachusetts revised its regulations governing solid waste management with a framework to encourage the reuse of organic
     waste material and prohibiting such material from disposal for largescale commercial generators by october 2014
     new york state is considering revisions to its regulations governing solid waste management 6 nycrr part 360 vermont is
     considering revisions to its regulations governing solid waste management through interaction with a stakeholder group
     although there is no federal law governing extended producer responsibility epr regulations many states have
     implemented epr regulations for certain products epr regulations are intended to place responsibility for ultimate
     management or endofusefullife handling of the products they create in addition to financial responsibility an epr program
     may include responsibility for local takeback or recycling programs for example several states in which we operate have
     epr regulations for electronic waste if broad epr laws or regulations were adopted and managed under a manufacturer
     implemented program it could have an impact on our business
     the epa and environmental agencies within individual states in which we operate also consider and promulgate changes to
     water quality standards action levels remediation goals and other federal or state regulatory standards for individual
     compounds or classes of compounds these changes can also include the development of new or more stringent standards for
     emerging contaminants including pfc compounds pharmaceutical compounds and a variety of synthetic chemical
     compounds used in manufacturing and industrial processes in december 2016 epa also designated ten chemical substances
     for risk evaluations under tsca based on the requirements of the june 2016 frank r lautenberg chemical safety for the
     21st century act changes in regulatory standards for existing or emerging contaminants can result in higher levels of cost and
     effort associated with the performance of environmental investigations and ongoing compliance at our facilities

     item 1a risk factors
     the following important factors among others could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward
     looking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time the
     risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and
     uncertainties facing us our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies
     including overall economic and industry conditions especially in the northeastern united states where our operations and
     customers are principally located changes in laws or accounting rules or other disruptions of expected economic or business
     conditions additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material also may
     impair our businesss results of operations and financial condition
     risks related to our business
     we face substantial competition in the solid waste services industry and if we cannot successfully compete in the
     marketplace our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected
     the solid waste services industry is highly competitive has undergone a period of consolidation and requires substantial labor
     and capital resources some of the markets in which we compete are served by or are adjacent to markets served by one or
     more of the large national or super regional solid waste companies as well as numerous regional and local solid waste
     companies intense competition exists not only to provide services to customers but also to acquire other businesses within
     each market some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do from time to time
     competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid contract
     these practices may require us to reduce the pricing of our services and may result in a loss of business
     as is generally the case in our industry some municipal contracts are subject to periodic competitive bidding we may not be
     the successful bidder to obtain or retain these contracts if we are unable to compete with larger and better capitalized
     companies or replace municipal contracts lost through the competitive bidding process with comparable contracts or other
     revenue sources within a reasonable time period our revenues would decrease and our operating results could be materially
     adversely affected
     in our solid waste disposal markets we also compete with operators of alternative disposal and recycling facilities and with
     counties municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own solid waste collection recycling and disposal
     operations we are also increasingly competing with companies which seek to use parts of the waste stream as feedstock for
     renewable energy supplies public entities may have financial advantages because of their ability to charge user fees or similar
     charges impose taxes and apply resulting revenues access taxexempt financing and in some cases utilize government
     subsidies
     the waste management industry is undergoing fundamental change as traditional waste streams are increasingly viewed as
     renewable resources which may adversely affect volumes and tipping fees at our landfills
     as we continue to develop our landfill capacity the waste management industry is recognizing the value of the waste stream as
     a renewable resource and accordingly alternatives to landfilling are being developed that seek to maximize the renewable
     energy and other resource benefits of solid waste these alternatives affect the demand for landfill airspace and could affect
     our ability to operate our landfills at full capacity as well as the tipping fees and prices that waste management companies
     generally and that we in particular can charge for landfill airspace reduced tipping fees can affect our willingness to incur
     the expenditures necessary to increase the permitted capacity of the landfills as a result our revenues and operating margins
     could be materially adversely affected due to these disposal alternatives
     the waste industry is subject to extensive government regulations including environmental regulations and we incur
     substantial costs to comply with such regulations failure to comply with environmental or other regulations as well as
     enforcement actions and litigation arising from an actual or perceived breach of such regulations could subject us to fines
     penalties and judgments and impose limits on our ability to operate and expand




                                                                    19

we are subject to potential liability and restrictions under environmental laws including those relating to transportation
recycling treatment storage and disposal of wastes discharges of pollutants to air and water and the remediation of
contaminated soil surface water and groundwater the waste management industry has been and will continue to be subject to
regulation including permitting and related financial assurance requirements as well as attempts to further regulate the
industry including efforts to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases our solid waste operations are subject to a wide range
of federal state and in some cases local environmental odor and noise and land use restrictions if we are not able to comply
with the requirements that apply to a particular facility or if we operate without the necessary approvals or permits we could be
subject to administrative or civil and possibly criminal fines and penalties and we may be required to spend substantial capital
to bring an operation into compliance to temporarily or permanently discontinue activities andor take corrective actions
possibly including removal of landfilled materials those costs or actions could be significant to us and affect our results of
operations cash flows and available capital environmental and land use laws also affect our ability to expand and in the case
of our solid waste operations may dictate those geographic areas from which we must or from which we may not accept solid
waste those laws and regulations may limit the overall size and daily solid waste volume that may be accepted by a solid
waste operation if we are not able to expand or otherwise operate one or more of our facilities because of limits imposed under
such laws we may be required to increase our utilization of disposal facilities owned by thirdparties which could reduce our
revenues andor operating margins
in addition to complying with environmental laws and regulations we are required to obtain government permits to operate our
facilities including all of our landfills there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the requisite permits and even if we
could that any permit and any existing permits we currently hold will be renewed or modified as needed to fit our business
needs localities where we operate generally seek to regulate some or all landfill and transfer station operations including
siting and expansion of operations the laws adopted by municipalities in which our landfills and transfer stations are located
may limit or prohibit the expansion of a landfill or transfer station as well as the amount of solid waste that we can accept at
the landfill or transfer station on a daily quarterly or annual basis and any effort to acquire or expand landfills and transfer
stations which typically involves a significant amount of time and expense we may not be successful in obtaining new landfill
or transfer station sites or expanding the permitted capacity of any of our current landfills and transfer stations if we are unable
to develop additional disposal and transfer station capacity our ability to achieve economies from the internalization of our
waste stream will be limited if we fail to receive new landfill permits or renew existing permits we may incur landfill asset
impairment and other charges associated with accelerated closure
we have historically grown through acquisitions may make additional acquisitions in the future and we have tried and will
continue to try to evaluate and limit environmental risks and liabilities presented by businesses to be acquired prior to the
acquisition it is possible that some liabilities may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than we anticipate it is also
possible that government officials responsible for enforcing environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than we
expect or that we will fail to identify or fully appreciate an existing liability before we become responsible for addressing it
some of the legal sanctions to which we could become subject could cause the suspension or revocation of a permit prevent us
from or delay us in obtaining or renewing permits to operate or expand our facilities or harm our reputation as of
december 31 2016 we had recorded 59 million in environmental remediation liabilities for the estimated cost of our share of
work associated with a consent order issued by the state of new york to remediate a scrap yard and solid waste transfer station
owned by one of our acquired subsidiaries including the recognition of accretion expense there can be no assurance that the
cost of such cleanup or that our share of that cost will not exceed our estimates
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations we incur costs defending against environmental
litigation brought by government agencies and private parties we are and may be in the future a defendant in lawsuits brought
by parties alleging environmental damage personal injury andor property damage or seeking to overturn or prevent the
issuance of an operating permit or authorization all of which may result in us incurring significant liabilities




                                                                 20

                                                                                                                                         20

     in october 2015 our southbridge recycling and disposal park subsidiary srdp reported to the massachusetts department
     of environmental protection madep results of analysis of samples collected pursuant to our existing permit from private
     drinking water wells located near the town of southbridge massachusetts landfill southbridge landfill which is operated
     by srdp those results indicated the presence of contaminants above the levels triggering notice and response obligations
     under madep regulations in response to those results we are carrying out an immediate response action pursuant to state
     law further we have implemented a plan to analyze and better understand the groundwater near the southbridge landfill and
     we are investigating with the objective of identifying the source or sources of the elevated levels of contamination measured in
     the well samples if it is determined that some or all of the contamination originated at the southbridge landfill we will work
     with the town of southbridge town the southbridge landfill owner and the former operator of an unlined portion of the
     southbridge landfill which was used prior to our operation of a doublelined portion of the southbridge landfill commencing
     in 2004 to evaluate and allocate the liabilities related to that contamination in july 2016 we sent correspondence to the town
     pursuant to chapter 21e of massachusetts general laws chapter 21e demanding that the town reimburse us for the
     incurrence of environmental response costs and that the town be responsible for all such costs in the future as well as any
     other costs or liabilities resulting from the release of contaminants from the unlined portion of the southbridge landfill the
     town responded in september 2016 denying that the southbridge landfill is the source of such contamination and claiming
     that if it is that we may owe an indemnity to the town pursuant to our operating agreement between us and the town dated
     may 29 2007 as amended as of december 31 2016 we have incurred total environmental response costs of over 25
     million we have entered into a tolling agreement with the town to delay any such administrative or legal actions until our
     work with madep more specifically defines the parties responsibilities in these matters if any
     in february 2016 we and the town received a notice of intent to sue under resource conservation and recovery act
     rcra from a law firm purporting to represent residents proximate to the southbridge landfill indicating its intent to file
     suit against us because of the ground water contamination in february 2017 we received an additional notice of intent to sue
     from the national environmental law center under the federal clean water act cwa and rcra the acts on behalf of
     environment america inc dba environment massachusetts and toxics action center inc which have referred to
     themselves as the citizen groups the citizen groups allege that we have violated the acts and that they intend to seek
     appropriate relief in federal court for those alleged violations we believe it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur as a
     result of these potential matters although an estimate of loss cannot be reasonably provided at this time we believe the town
     should be responsible for any costs or liabilities associated with these possible suits relative to alleged contamination
     originating from the unlined portion of the southbridge landfill although there can be no assurance that we will not be
     required to incur some or all of such costs and liabilities
     while no suit has yet been filed against us or the town related to the foregoing we have reached an agreement in principle
     subject to a definitive agreement between madep the town of southbridge the town of charlton and ourselves for the
     equal sharing of costs between madep and us of up to 10 million 5 million each for the town to install a municipal
     waterline in the town of charlton it is expected that the town will issue a bond for our portion of the waterline costs and we
     expect to amend the operating agreement to provide for us to reimburse the town for periodic payments under such bond
     this waterline will provide municipal water to certain charlton residents
     the costs and liabilities we may be required to incur in connection with the foregoing could be material to our results of
     operations our cash flows and our financial condition we are carefully evaluating the impact and potential impact of the
     foregoing matters together with estimated future costs associated with the permitting engineering and construction activities
     for the planned expansion of the southbridge landfill against the possible outcomes of the permitting process and the
     anticipated future benefits of a successful expansion it is possible that based on this analysis we may conclude that closing the
     southbridge landfill is in our best economic interest while no conclusions have been reached at this time and we continue to
     be committed to the expansion process we are acting to prudently manage waste volumes into the southbridge landfill to
     prolong the useful life of the southbridge landfill in the event we are unsuccessful in obtaining the expansion permit or choose
     to modify or withdraw our permit application due to our estimate of the economic benefit of the expansion relative to costs
     we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for our environmental liabilities such coverage may not cover all of the
     potential liabilities we may be subject to andor we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at reasonable
     expense or at all
     the conduct of our businesses is also subject to various other laws and regulations administered by federal state and local
     governmental agencies including tax laws employment laws and competition laws among others new laws regulations or
     governmental policy and their related interpretations or changes in any of the foregoing including taxes or other limitations on
     our services may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or
     liabilities




                                                                    21

in certain jurisdictions we are subject to compliance with specific obligations under competition laws due to our competitive
position in those jurisdictions for example in may 2002 we entered into an assurance of discontinuance with the vermont
attorney generals office concerning among other matters the conduct of our business in vermont relating to certain contract
terms applicable to our small commercial container customers in august 2011 a revised final judgment of consent and order
was entered by the vermont superior court washington unit civil division as a result of some of our small commercial
container customers having been mistakenly issued contracts that did not strictly comply with the terms of the assurance of
discontinuance pursuant to the order we paid a civil penalty in an aggregate amount of 10 million in july 2014 we entered
into an assurance of discontinuance with the office of the new york attorney general in connection with certain of our
commercial practices in certain specified counties in new york pursuant to which we paid the state of new york a sum of 01
million the assurances of discontinuance and order provide for certain restrictions on our customer contract terms certain
conditions on our business acquisitions sales and market share and require us to maintain an internal compliance program
failure to comply with these requirements or other laws or regulations could subject us to enforcement actions or financial
penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business
see also item 1 business item 3 legal proceedings and note 10 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated
financial statements included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k
our results of operations could continue to be affected by fluctuating commodity prices or market requirements for
recyclable materials
our results of operations have been and may continue to be affected by changing purchase or resale prices or market
requirements for recyclable materials our recycling business involves the purchase and sale of recyclable materials some of
which are priced on a commodity basis the market for recyclable materials was affected by unprecedented price decreases in
october 2008 resulting in a severe impact on our results of operations the commodity markets continue to see ongoing
negative pressure on pricing associated with the decline of the fiber market due to less use of paper products such as newspaper
and office paper as a result of increased online reading from an export standpoint chinas slowing economic environment
and increasing ability to create its own domestic recyclables has changed the landscape of the recycling markets which has
decreased the demand for us fiber on the domestic front within the northeast there continues to be very little demand for
the newspaper grade leading us to turn to the export market throughout all material recovery facilities within our footprint the
plastic grades continue to decline with lower oil prices although we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuating commodity
prices through the implementation of the sustainability recycling adjustment and the use of hedging agreements floor price
contracts and longterm supply contracts with customers and have sought to mitigate commodity price fluctuations by reducing
the prices we pay for purchased materials or increasing tip fees at our facilities these fluctuations have in the past contributed
and may continue to contribute to significant variability in our periodtoperiod results of operations we cannot provide
assurance that we can pass this fee on to our customers where their contracts and competition conditions permit
our business requires a high level of capital expenditures
our business is capital intensive our capital expenditure requirements include fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures
for landfill development and cell construction as well as site and cell closure we use a substantial portion of our cash flows
from operating activities toward capital expenditures which reduces our flexibility to use such cash flows for other purposes
such as reducing our indebtedness our capital expenditures could increase if we make acquisitions or further expand our
operations or as a result of factors beyond our control such as changes in federal state or local governmental requirements
the amount that we spend on capital expenditures may exceed current expectations which may require us to obtain additional
funding for our operations or impair our ability to grow our business
our business is geographically concentrated and is therefore subject to regional economic downturns
our operations and customers are concentrated principally in new england and new york therefore our business financial
condition and results of operations are susceptible to regional economic downturns and other regional factors including state
regulations and budget constraints and severe weather conditions in addition as we seek to expand in our existing markets
opportunities for growth within this region will become more limited and the geographic concentration of our business will
increase




                                                                22

                                                                                                                                       22

     our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we inadequately accrue for final capping
     closure and postclosure costs or by the timing of these costs for our waste disposal facilities
     we have material financial obligations relating to final capping closure and postclosure costs of our existing owned or
     operated landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any disposal facilities that we may own or operate
     in the future once the permitted capacity of a particular landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized the
     landfill must be closed and capped and we must begin postclosure maintenance we establish accruals for the estimated costs
     associated with such final capping closure and postclosure obligations over the anticipated useful life of each landfill on a per
     ton basis we have provided and expect that we will in the future provide accruals for financial obligations relating to final
     capping closure and postclosure costs of our owned or operated landfills generally for a term of 30 years after closure of a
     landfill our financial obligations for final capping closure or postclosure costs could exceed the amounts accrued or amounts
     otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose such a circumstance could result in significant
     unanticipated charges which would have an adverse effect on our business
     in addition the timing of any such final capping closure or postclosure costs which exceed established accruals may further
     negatively affect our business since we will be unable to control the timing and amounts of such costs we may be forced to
     delay investments or planned improvements in other parts of our business or we may be unable to meet applicable financial
     assurance requirements any of the foregoing would negatively affect our business and results of operations
     fluctuations in fuel costs could affect our operating expenses and results
     the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond our control including among others
     geopolitical developments supply and demand for oil and gas actions by the organization of the petroleum exporting
     countries and other oil and gas producers war and unrest in oil producing countries and regional production patterns because
     fuel is needed to run our fleet of trucks price escalations for fuel increase our operating expenses in fiscal year 2016 we used
     approximately 48 million gallons of diesel fuel in our solid waste operations although we have a fuel and oil recovery fee
     program based on a fuel index to help offset increases in the cost of fuel oil and lubricants arising from price volatility we
     cannot provide assurance that we can pass this fee on to our customers where their contracts and competition conditions permit
     we could be precluded from entering into contracts or obtaining or maintaining permits or certain contracts if we are
     unable to obtain thirdparty financial assurance to secure our contractual obligations
     public solid waste collection recycling and disposal contracts and obligations associated with landfill closure typically require
     performance or surety bonds letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance we
     currently obtain performance and surety bonds from evergreen in which we hold a 199 equity interest if we are unable to
     obtain the necessary financial assurance in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates we could be precluded from entering into
     additional municipal contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill management contracts or operating permits any future
     difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon having adequate
     insurance coverage
     we may be required to writeoff or impair capitalized costs or intangible assets in the future or we may incur restructuring
     costs or other charges each of which could harm our earnings
     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we capitalize certain expenditures and
     advances relating to our acquisitions pending acquisitions landfills cost method investments and development projects in
     addition we have considerable unamortized assets from time to time in future periods we may be required to incur a charge
     against earnings in an amount equal to any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion thereof that
     we estimate will be recoverable through sale or otherwise relating to 1 any operation or other asset that is being sold
     permanently shut down or impaired or has not generated or is not expected to generate sufficient cash flow 2 any pending
     acquisition that is not consummated 3 any landfill or development project that is not expected to be successfully completed
     and 4 any goodwill or other intangible assets that are determined to be impaired
     in response to such charges and costs and other market factors we may be required to implement restructuring plans in an
     effort to reduce the size and cost of our operations and to better match our resources with our market opportunities as a result
     of such actions we would expect to incur restructuring expenses and accounting charges which may be material several
     factors could cause a restructuring to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations these include
     potential disruption of our operations the development of our landfill capacity and recycling technologies and other aspects of
     our business employee morale and productivity could also suffer and result in unintended employee attrition any
     restructuring would require substantial management time and attention and may divert management from other important work
     moreover we could encounter delays in executing any restructuring plans which could cause further disruption and additional
     unanticipated expense




                                                                     23

see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies and note 16 divestiture transactions and discontinued operations to
our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for disclosure related to asset
impairments recognized during the disclosed reporting periods
our revenues and our operating income experience seasonal fluctuations
our transfer and disposal revenues historically have been higher in the late spring summer and early fall months this
seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste during the late fall winter and early spring months primarily because
      the volume of waste relating to cd activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern
       united states and
      decreased tourism in vermont maine and eastern new york during the winter months tends to lower the volume of solid
       waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers which is partially offset by increased volume from the ski
       industry
since certain of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year operating income is impacted by a
similar seasonality in addition particularly harsh weather conditions typically result in increased operating costs
our recycling business experiences increased volumes of fiber in november and december due to increased newspaper
advertising and retail activity during the holiday season
adverse weather conditions may limit our operations and increase the costs of collection and disposal
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather or by increased
severity of weather adverse weather could increase our operating costs associated with the collection and disposal of waste
delay the collection and disposal of waste reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites increase the volume of
waste collected under our existing contracts without corresponding compensation decrease the throughput and operating
efficiency of our materials recycling facilities or delay construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities in
addition adverse weather conditions may result in the temporary suspension of our operations which can significantly affect
our operating results in the affected regions during those periods
we may in the future attempt to divest or sell certain parts or components of our business to thirdparties which may result
in lower than expected proceeds or losses or the inability to identify potential purchasers
from time to time in the future we may sell or divest certain other components of our business these divestitures may be
undertaken for a number of reasons including to generate proceeds to pay down debt or as a result of a determination that the
specified asset will provide inadequate returns to us that the asset no longer serves a strategic purpose in connection with our
business or that the asset may be more valuable to a thirdparty the timing of such sales or divestitures may not be entirely
within our control for example we may need to quickly divest assets to satisfy immediate cash requirements or we may be
forced to sell certain assets prior to canvassing the market or at a time when market conditions for valuations or for financing
for buyers are unfavorable such sales or divestitures may result in proceeds to us in an amount less than we expect or less than
our assessment of the value of those assets we also may not be able to identify buyers for certain of our assets particularly
given the difficulty that potential acquirers may face in obtaining financing or we may face opposition from municipalities or
communities to a disposition or the proposed buyer any sale of our assets could result in a loss on divestiture any of the
foregoing would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations
we may engage in acquisitions in the future with the goal of complementing or expanding our business including
developing additional disposal capacity however we may be unable to complete these transactions and if executed these
transactions may not improve our business or may pose significant risks and could have a negative effect on our operations
we have in the past and we may in the future make acquisitions in order to acquire or develop additional disposal capacity
these acquisitions may include tuckin acquisitions within our existing markets acquisitions of assets that are adjacent to or
outside of our existing markets or larger more strategic acquisitions in addition from time to time we may acquire businesses
that are complementary to our core business strategy we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates if we
identify suitable acquisition candidates we may be unable to successfully negotiate the acquisition at a price or on terms and
conditions acceptable to us including as a result of the limitations imposed by our debt obligations furthermore we may be
unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval to complete potential acquisitions




                                                                 24

                                                                                                                                      24

     our ability to achieve the benefits from any potential future acquisitions including cost savings and operating efficiencies
     depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations the
     integration of acquired businesses and other assets may require significant management time and resources that would
     otherwise be available for the ongoing management of our existing operations any properties or facilities that we acquire may
     be subject to unknown liabilities such as undisclosed environmental contamination for which we would have no recourse or
     only limited recourse to the former owners of such properties as a result if a liability were asserted against us based upon
     ownership of an acquired property we might be required to pay significant sums to settle it which could adversely affect our
     financial results and cash flow
     efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management attention and increase our operating expenses
     labor unions regularly make attempts to organize our employees and these efforts will likely continue in the future certain
     groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements
     with these groups the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in
     increased operating expenses and lower net income or increased net loss if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective
     bargaining agreements we may be subject to unioninitiated work stoppages including strikes depending on the type and
     duration of any labor disruptions our revenues could decrease and our operating expenses could increase which could
     adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows as of january 31 2017 approximately 5 of our
     employees were represented by unions
     risks related to our indebtedness
     we have substantial debt and have the ability to incur additional debt the principal and interest payment obligations of
     such debt may restrict our future operations
     as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 5256 million of outstanding principal indebtedness excluding
     approximately 253 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our credit facility which consists of the term loan b
     facility with term loans in the outstanding principal amount of 3500 million and the revolving credit facility with loans
     thereunder being available up to an aggregate principal amount of 1600 million and an additional 721 million of unused
     commitments under the revolving credit facility subject to customary borrowing conditions in addition the terms of our
     existing indebtedness permit us to incur additional debt our substantial debt among other things
          requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due
           under our debt which reduces funds available for other business purposes including capital expenditures and
           acquisitions
          places us at a competitive disadvantage compared with some of our competitors that may have less debt and better
           access to capital resources and
          limits our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other
           general corporate purposes but does allow us to increase the amount of our debt substantially subject to the conditions in
           the credit facility
     our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on
     economic financial competitive and other factors many of which are beyond our control our business may not generate
     sufficient cash flow and future financings may not be available to provide sufficient net proceeds to meet these obligations or
     to successfully execute our business strategy
     to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash however our ability to generate cash depends on
     many factors beyond our control
     our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on
     our ability to generate cash in the future which in turn is subject to general economic financial competitive regulatory and
     other factors many of which are beyond our control
     our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations and we may not have available to us future borrowings in
     an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs in these circumstances we may
     need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity we may not be able to refinance any of our
     indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all without this financing we could be forced to sell assets or secure
     additional financing to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations under unfavorable circumstances however we
     may not be able to secure additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all and in addition the terms of our debt
     agreements limit our ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale moreover substantially all of
     our assets have been pledged to secure repayment of our indebtedness under the credit facility in addition we may not be able
     to sell assets quickly enough or for amounts sufficient to enable it to meet our obligations


                                                                     25

the credit facility requires us to meet a number of financial ratios and covenants
the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants which among other things and subject in certain cases
to certain basket amounts and other exceptions limit the existence of additional indebtedness the existence of liens or pledges
certain investments acquisitions and sales or other transfers of assets the payment of dividends and distributions and
repurchases of equity prepayments of certain junior indebtedness and certain other transactions our ability to comply with
these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control including prevailing economic financial and industry
conditions these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing
merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities additionally the credit facility requires solely for the benefit of the
lenders under the revolving credit facility that we meet financial tests including without limitation
       minimum consolidated ebitda to consolidated cash interest charges ratio and
       maximum consolidated funded debt net of up to an agreed amount of cash and cash equivalents to consolidated
        ebitda ratio
an event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders including the lenders under the credit
facility to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable together with accrued and unpaid
interest or in the case of the credit facility terminate the commitment to make further credit extensions thereunder which
could in turn trigger crossdefaults under other debt obligations if we were unable to repay debt to our lenders or were
otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations our secured lenders could proceed against
us and against the collateral securing that debt
our ability to make acquisitions may be adversely impacted by our outstanding indebtedness
our ability to make future business acquisitions particularly those that would be financed solely or in part through cash from
operations will be curtailed due to our obligations to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness
we may not have sufficient capital resources now or in the future and may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital
resources on terms satisfactory to us if at all in order to meet our capital requirements for such acquisitions in addition the
terms of our indebtedness include covenants that directly restrict or have the effect of restricting our ability to make certain
acquisitions while this indebtedness remains outstanding if we are unable to pursue acquisitions that would enhance our
business or operations the potential growth of our business and revenues may be adversely affected

     in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 45020 we
     accrue for legal proceedings inclusive of legal costs when losses become probable and reasonably estimable as of the end of
     each applicable reporting period we review each of our legal proceedings to determine whether it is probable reasonably
     possible or remote that a liability has been incurred and if it is at least reasonably possible whether a range of loss can be
     reasonably estimated under the provisions of fasb asc 45020 in instances where we determine that a loss is probable and
     we can reasonably estimate a range of loss we may incur with respect to such a matter we record an accrual for the amount
     within the range that constitutes our best estimate of the possible loss if we are able to reasonably estimate a range but no
     amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we record an accrual in the amount that is the low end

environmental remediation liability
we are subject to liability for environmental damage including personal injury and property damage that our solid waste
recycling and power generation facilities may cause to neighboring property owners particularly as a result of the
contamination of drinking water sources or soil possibly including damage resulting from conditions that existed before we
acquired the facilities we may also be subject to liability for similar claims arising from offsite environmental contamination
caused by pollutants or hazardous substances if we or our predecessors arrange or arranged to transport treat or dispose of
those materials the following matters represents our outstanding material claims
southbridge recycling  disposal park inc
in october 2015 our southbridge recycling and disposal park inc srd subsidiary reported to the massachusetts
department of environmental protection madep results of analysis of samples collected pursuant to our existing permit
from private drinking water wells located near the town of southbridge massachusetts landfill southbridge landfill
which is operated by srd those results indicated the presence of contaminants above the levels triggering notice and response
obligations under madep regulations in response to those results we are carrying out an immediate response action
pursuant to state law further we have implemented a plan to analyze and better understand the groundwater near the
southbridge landfill and we are investigating with the objective of identifying the source or sources of the elevated levels of
contamination measured in the well samples if it is determined that some or all of the contamination originated at the
southbridge landfill we will work with the town of southbridge town the southbridge landfill owner and the former
operator of an unlined portion of the southbridge landfill which was used prior to our operation of a doublelined portion of
the southbridge landfill commencing in 2004 to evaluate and allocate the liabilities related to that contamination in july
2016 we sent correspondence to the town pursuant to chapter 21e of massachusetts general laws chapter 21e
demanding that the town reimburse us for the incurrence of environmental response costs and that the town be responsible for
all such costs in the future as well as any other costs or liabilities resulting from the release of contaminants from the unlined
portion of the southbridge landfill the town responded in september 2016 denying that the southbridge landfill is the
source of such contamination and claiming that if it is that we may owe an indemnity to the town pursuant to the operating
agreement between us and the town dated may 29 2007 as amended as of december 31 2016 we have incurred total
environmental response costs of over 25 million we have entered into a tolling agreement with the town to delay any
further administrative or legal actions until our work with madep more specifically defines the parties responsibilities in
these matters if any
in february 2016 we and the town received a notice of intent to sue under the resource conservation and recovery act
rcra from a law firm purporting to represent residents proximate to the southbridge landfill indicating its intent to file
suit against us because of the groundwater contamination in february 2017 we received an additional notice of intent to sue
from the national environmental law center under the federal clean water act cwa and rcra the acts on behalf of
environment america inc dba environment massachusetts and toxics action center inc which have referred to
themselves as the citizen groups the citizen groups allege that we have violated the acts and that they they intend to seek
appropriate relief in federal court for those alleged violations we believe it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur as a
result of these potential matters although an estimate of loss cannot be reasonably provided at this time we believe the town
should be responsible for costs or liabilities associated with these possible suits relative to alleged contamination originating
from the unlined portion of the southbridge landfill although there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur
some or all of such costs and liabilities
while no suit has yet been filed against us or the town related to the foregoing we have reached an agreement in principle
subject to a definitive agreement between madep the town of southbridge the town of charlton and ourselves for the
equal sharing of costs between madep and us of up to 10 million 5 million each for the town to install a municipal
waterline in the town of charlton it is expected that the town will issue a bond for our portion of the waterline costs and we
expect to amend the operating agreement to provide for us to reimburse the town for periodic payments under such bond
this waterline will provide municipal water to certain charlton residents
in august 2016 we filed a complaint against steadfast insurance company steadfast in the superior court of suffolk
county massachusetts alleging among other things that steadfast breached its pollution liability policy policy purchased
by us in april 2015 by refusing to acknowledge coverage under the policy and refusing to cover any of the costs and liabilities
incurred by us as described above as well as costs and liabilities that we may incur in the future steadfast filed an answer and
counterclaim in september 2016 denying that it has any obligations to us under the policy and seeking declaratory judgment

     the costs and liabilities we may be required to incur in connection with the foregoing could be material to our results of
     operations our cash flows and our financial condition we are carefully evaluating the impact and potential impact of the
     foregoing matters together with estimated future costs associated with the permitting engineering and construction activities
     for the planned expansion of the southbridge landfill against the possible outcomes of the permitting process and the
     anticipated future benefits of a successful expansion it is possible that based on this analysis we may conclude that closing the
     southbridge landfill is in our best economic interest while no conclusions have been reached at this time and we continue to
     be committed to the expansion process we are acting to prudently manage waste volumes into the southbridge landfill to
     prolong the useful life of the southbridge landfill in the event we are unsuccessful in obtaining the expansion permit or choose
     to modify or withdraw our permit application due to our estimate of the economic benefit of the expansion relative to costs
     potsdam environmental remediation liability
     on december 20 2000 the state of new york department of environmental conservation dec issued an order on
     consent order which named wastestream inc wsi our subsidiary general motors corporation gm and niagara
     mohawk power corporation nimo as respondents the order required that the respondents undertake certain work on a
     25acre scrap yard and solid waste transfer station owned by wsi in potsdam new york including the preparation of a
     remedial investigation and feasibility study study a draft of the study was submitted to the dec in january 2009
     followed by a final report in may 2009 the study estimated that the undiscounted costs associated with implementing the
     preferred remedies would be approximately 102 million on february 28 2011 the dec issued a proposed remedial action
     plan for the site and accepted public comments on the proposed remedy through march 29 2011 we submitted comments to
     the dec on this matter in april 2011 the dec issued the final record of decision rod for the site the rod was
     subsequently rescinded by the dec for failure to respond to all submitted comments the preliminary rod however
     estimated that the present cost associated with implementing the preferred remedies would be approximately 121 million the
     dec issued the final rod in june 2011 with proposed remedies consistent with its earlier rod an order on consent and
     administrative settlement naming wsi and nimo as respondents was executed by the respondents and dec with an
     effective date of october 25 2013 on january 29 2016 a costsharing agreement was executed between wsi nimo alcoa
     inc alcoa and reynolds metal company reynolds whereby alcoa and reynolds elected to voluntarily participate in
     the onsite remediation activities at a 15 participant share it is unlikely that any significant expenditures relating to onsite
     remediation will be incurred until the fiscal year ending december 31 2018 wsi is jointly and severally liable with nimo
     alcoa and reynolds for the total cost to remediate
     we have recorded an environmental remediation liability associated with the potsdam site based on incurred costs to date and
     estimated costs to complete the remediation in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities our expenditures could
     be significantly higher if costs exceed estimates we inflate the estimated costs in current dollars to the expected time of
     payment and discount the total cost to present value using a risk free interest rate of 15
     the changes to the environmental remediation liability associated with the potsdam environmental remediation liability are as
     follows

we have made in the past and we may make in the future acquisitions in order to acquire or develop additional disposal
capacity these acquisitions may include tuckin acquisitions within our existing markets assets that are adjacent to or
outside of our existing markets or larger more strategic acquisitions in addition from time to time we may acquire businesses
that are complementary to our core business strategy we face considerable competition for acquisition targets particularly the
larger and more meaningful targets due to among other things our limited access to and weighted average cost of capital but
we believe that our strong relationships and reputation in new england and the upstate new york area help to offset these
factors

     company that markets an incentive based recycling service in both fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014 it was
     determined based on the operating performance of recycle rewards that our cost method investment in recycle rewards was
     potentially impaired as a result we performed a valuation analysis in fiscal year 2015 and had a valuation analysis performed
     by a thirdparty valuation specialist in transition period 2014 both of which used an income approach based on discounted cash
     flows to determine an equity value for recycle rewards in order to properly value our cost method investment in recycle
     rewards based on these analyses it was determined in each case that the fair value of our cost method investment in recycle

     dedesignated both of the 750 million forward starting interest rate derivative agreements and discontinued hedge accounting

in addition to the financial covenants described above the credit agreement also contains a number of important customary
affirmative and negative covenants which restrict among other things our ability to sell assets incur additional debt create
liens make investments and pay dividends we do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability to meet future liquidity
needs
as of december 31 2016 we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit agreement an event of default
under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders including the lenders under the credit facility to declare
all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest or in the case
of the credit facility terminate the commitment to make further credit extensions thereunder which could in turn trigger
crossdefaults under other debt obligations if we were unable to repay debt to our lenders or were otherwise in default under
any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations our secured lenders could proceed against us and against the
collateral securing that debt
based on the seasonality of our business operating results in the late fall winter and early spring months are generally lower
than the remainder of our fiscal year given the cash flow impact that this seasonality the capital intensive nature of our
business and the timing of debt payments has on our business we typically incur higher debt borrowings in order to meet our
liquidity needs during these times consequently our availability and performance against our financial covenants tighten
during these times as well

inflation
although inflationary increases in costs have affected our historical operating margins we believe that inflation generally has
not had a significant impact on our operating results consistent with industry practice most of our contracts provide for a
passthrough of certain costs to our customers including increases in landfill tipping fees and in some cases fuel costs intended
to mitigate the impact of inflation on our operating results we have also implemented a number of operating efficiency
programs that seek to improve productivity and reduce our service costs and a fuel and oil recovery fee which is designed to
recover escalating fuel price fluctuations above an annually reset floor based on these implementations we believe we should
be able to sufficiently offset most cost increases resulting from inflation however competitive factors may require us to absorb
at least a portion of these cost increases additionally managements estimates associated with inflation have had and will
continue to have an impact on our accounting for landfill and environmental remediation liabilities
regional economic conditions
our business is primarily located in the northeastern united states therefore our business financial condition and results of
operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region
such as state regulations and severe weather conditions we are unable to forecast or determine the timing andor the future
impact of a sustained economic slowdown


                                                                62

     critical accounting estimates and assumptions
     our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap and necessarily include certain estimates
     and judgments made by management on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are
     based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the
     results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities actual results
     may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances the following is a list of accounting policies
     that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows
     and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain our
     significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in note 3 summary of significant accounting policies of our
     consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k
     landfill accounting
     landfill development costs
     we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity see landfill
     development costs discussed within the property plant and equipment accounting policy more fully discussed in note 3
     summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report
     on form 10k the projection of these landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of
     each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously
     expended and capitalized net of accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs
     including capitalized interest the interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on
     borrowings outstanding during the period
     under lifecycle accounting all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to
     expense based on tonnage placed into each site landfill permitting acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the
     unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed in determining the amortization rate for each of our landfills
     preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and expansion capacity
     final capping closure and postclosure costs
     the cost estimates for final capping closure and postclosure activities at landfills for which we have responsibility are
     estimated based on our interpretations of current requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes we also
     estimate additional costs based on the amount a thirdparty would charge us to perform such activities even when we expect to
     perform these activities internally we estimate the airspace to be consumed related to each final capping event and the timing
     of construction related to each final capping event and of closure and postclosure activities because landfill final capping
     closure and postclosure obligations are measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques changes in the
     estimated timing of construction of future landfill final capping and closure and postclosure activities would have an effect on
     these liabilities related assets and results of operations
     final capping activities include the installation of liners drainage compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill
     where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received final capping activities occur throughout the
     life of the landfill our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage to be capped
     along with the final capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would actually be
     paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each final
     capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill


                                                                     63

closure and postclosure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill
after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes we estimate based on input from our engineers accountants lawyers
managers and others our future cost requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring and maintenance based on our
interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act of
1970 as amended as they are being applied on a statebystate basis closure and postclosure accruals for the cost of
monitoring and maintenance include site inspection groundwater monitoring leachate management methane gas control and
recovery and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is generally for a term of 30 years after final
closure of a landfill in determining estimated future closure and postclosure costs we consider costs associated with permitted
and permittable airspace
remaining permitted airspace
our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are responsible for determining
remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey which is
then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography
expansion airspace
we currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain
circumstances to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met
      we control the land on which the expansion is sought
      all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained
      we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor
      we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received and
      senior management has approved the project
for unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort
must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers accountants lawyers
managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the remaining permitted and expansion
airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted
and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from annual surveys when we
include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we include the projected costs
for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the
expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill
after determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per
ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at each of our landfills by dividing the costs by the
corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each final capping event for
assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each
landfill these rates per ton are updated annually or more frequently as significant facts change
it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure
activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different
from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different
than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher final capping closure or
postclosure rates or higher expenses higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is
determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we
may be required to recognize an asset impairment if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has
become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately
environmental remediation liabilities
we have recorded environmental remediation liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for
which we have determined that a liability is probable these liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations
settlements certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as
materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental
remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we estimate costs required to
remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on sitespecific facts and circumstances estimates
of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers where we
believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and timing of payments are reliably
determinable we inflate the cost in current dollars until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value

                                                                  64

                                                                                                                                        64

     goodwill and other intangibles
     we annually assess goodwill for impairment at the end of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate
     that impairment may exist historically we had performed our annual goodwill impairment test using our fiscal yearend of
     april 30th as the measurement date effective with the change in our fiscal yearend from april 30th to december 31st we
     voluntarily changed our goodwill impairment measurement date from april 30th to december 31st to coincide with the change
     in our fiscal yearend the voluntary change in our goodwill impairment measurement date was applied prospectively
     beginning december 31 2014 as it represents the modification of an existing principle based on new facts and
     circumstanceswe may assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment if
     we perform a qualitative assessment it involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more
     likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this
     qualitative assessment we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
     amount we will not perform a quantitative assessment if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that
     the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we
     perform a quantitative assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the
     reporting unit
     in the first step defined as step 1 of testing for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit
     which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments our recycling segment and our customer solutions
     business which is included in the other segment and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each
     reporting unit if the fair value is less than its carrying value then we would perform a second step defined as step 2 and
     determine the fair value of the goodwill in step 2 the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a
     reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had
     just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated
     to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses which require
     significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit significant judgments inherent in this
     analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and
     growth rates the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed
     internally by management our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate
     applicable for each reporting unit in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units we
     evaluate our results against our current market capitalization
     if the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded to
     earnings the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized
     the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis
     in addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or
     circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances
     include the following
        a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate
        an adverse action or assessment by a regulator
        a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold or
        the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment




                                                                       65

we elected to perform a quantitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2016 as of
december 31 2016 the step 1 testing for goodwill impairment performed for our eastern western recycling and customer
solutions reporting units indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill
furthermore the step 1 test indicated that in each case the fair value of our eastern western recycling and customer
solutions reporting units exceeded its carrying value by in excess of 746 we incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result
of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal year 2016 fiscal year 2015 transition period 2014 and fiscal year 2014
however there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future
intangible assets consist primarily of covenants nottocompete and customer lists intangible assets are recorded at fair value
and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives
covenants nottocompete and customer lists are typically amortized over a term of no more than 10 years
recovery of longlived assets
we continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated
useful lives of our longlived assets other than goodwill or whether the remaining balances of those assets should be evaluated
for possible impairment longlived assets include for example capitalized landfill costs other property and equipment and
identifiable intangible assets events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that an asset may be impaired include the
following
   a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group
   a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical
    condition
   a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset group
    including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator
   an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
    longlived asset
   a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
    forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group
   a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
    significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or
   an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit
there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied
to landfill development or expansion for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application
although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill
to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of
business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry
if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset
group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows we group our longlived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups if the carrying values
are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset
or asset group to its carrying value
to determine fair value we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset
group this analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate the amount and timing of expected future cash
flows and growth rates the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial
forecasts developed internally by management the discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved we may also
rely on thirdparty valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group
impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs estimating future cash flows
requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized

     have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the
     cost method of accounting
     we monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down
     to their fair value when otherthantemporary declines exist fair value is generally based on i other thirdparty investors
     recent transactions in the securities ii other information available regarding the current market for similar assets andor iii a
     market or income approach as deemed appropriate
     when we assess the carrying value of our investments for potential impairment determining the fair value of our investments is
     reliant upon the availability of market information andor other information provided by thirdparties to be able to develop an
     estimate of fair value considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value
     accordingly our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we or other holders of these investments could
     realize in a current market exchange the use of different assumptions andor estimation methodologies could have a
     significant effect on the estimated fair values the current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts
     presented

     selfinsurance liabilities and related costs
     we are selfinsured for vehicles and workers compensation with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure our
     maximum exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the workers compensation plan was 10 million per individual event our
     maximum exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the automobile plan was 12 million per individual event the liability for
     unpaid claims and associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses is determined by management with the
     assistance of a thirdparty actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability we use a thirdparty to
     track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation the actuarially
     determined liability is calculated based on historical data which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims
     our estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the
     frequency or severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions
     see note 3 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included under item 8 of this
     annual report on form 10k for further disclosure
     income taxes
     we use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance
     recorded against our net deferred tax assets valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may
     not be realized for certain deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax
     consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities calculated using
     currently enacted tax rates we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be
     realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals
     of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event
     we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded
     amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes
     we account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition derecognition and measurement of potential
     tax benefits associated with tax positions we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of
     income tax expense

we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant
uncertainty we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of
loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and
regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities managements assessment is developed
based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are
probable and reasonably estimable if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible we will disclose the potential range of
the loss if estimable we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses
depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency contingent liabilities accounted for under
purchase accounting are recorded at their fair values these fair values may be different from the values we would have
otherwise recorded had the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an acquisition of a business see note 4 business
acquisitions for disclosure over a contingent liability assumed as part of the acquisition of a business

stockbased compensation
all sharebased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is
recognized as expensein general and administration expense over the employees requisite service period for purposes of
calculating stockbased compensation expense forfeitures are accounted for as they occur our equity awards granted generally
consist of stock options including marketbased performance stock options restricted stock awards restricted stock units and
performance stock units including marketbased performance stock units
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using a blackscholes optionpricing model with the exception of
marketbased performance stock option grants which are valued using a monte carlo optionpricing model the fair value of
restricted stock award restricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants is at a price equal to the fair market value of our
class a common stock at the date of grant the fair value of marketbased performance stock unit grants is valued using a
monte carlo pricing model

defined benefit pension plan
we currently have one qualified multiemployer defined benefit pension plan the new england teamsters and trucking
industry pension fund pension plan that we make contributions to the pension plan provides retirement benefits to
participants based on their service to contributing employers we do not administer this plan the pension plans benefit
formula is based on credited years of service and hours worked as defined in the pension plan document however the benefits
accruals of all current plan participants are frozen our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards
established by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 and the internal revenue code as amended by the
pension protection act of 2006 the pension plans assets have been invested as determined by the pension plans fiduciaries in
accordance with the pension plans investment policy the pension plans asset allocation is based on the pension plans
investment policy and is reviewed as deemed necessary

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks including changes in interest rates and certain commodity
prices we have a variety of strategies to mitigate these market risks including at times using derivative instruments to hedge
some portion of these risks
interest rate volatility
we had interest rate risk relating to approximately 4162 million of longterm debt at december 31 2016 the weighted
average interest rate on the variable rate portion of longterm debt was approximately 40 at december 31 2016 should the
average interest rate on the variable rate portion of longterm debt change by 100 basis points we estimate that our annual
interest expense would change by up to approximately 42 million the remainder of our longterm debt is at fixed rates and
not subject to interest rate risk


                                                                 68

                                                                                                                                      68

     our strategy to hedge against fluctuations in variable interest rates involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to
     hedge against adverse movements in interest rates as of december 31 2016 we were not party to any interest rate derivative
     agreements
     in january 2017 we entered into three interest rate derivative agreements to hedge interest rate risk associated with the variable
     rate portion of our longterm debt the total notional amount of these agreements is 600 million and requires us to receive
     interest based on changes in the 1month libor index with a 10 floor and pay interest at a weighted average rate of
     approximately 195 two of the agreements with a total notional amount of 350 million mature in february 2021 and the
     final agreement with a total notional amount of 250 million matures in february 2022
     we designated the three interest rate derivative agreements as effective cash flow hedges upon inception and therefore the
     change in fair value is recorded in our stockholders equity deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
     income loss and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transactions
     differences paid or received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the
     underlying debt
     commodity price volatility
     through our recycling operation we market a variety of materials including fibers such as old corrugated cardboard and old
     newsprint plastics glass ferrous and aluminum metals we may use a number of strategies to mitigate impacts from
     commodity price fluctuations including 1 charging collection customers a floating sustainability recycling adjustment fee to
     offtake recycling commodity risks 2 inbound mrf customers receiving a revenue share or indexed materials purchases in
     higher commodity price markets or charging these same customers a processing cost or tipping fee per ton lower commodity
     price markets 3 selling recycling commodities to outbound mrf customers through floor price or fixed price agreements or
     4 by entering into fixed price contracts and entering into hedges which mitigate the variability in cash flows generated from
     the sales of recycled paper at floating prices  we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to
     any leveraged derivatives as of december 31 2016 we were not party to any commodity hedging agreements
     should commodity prices change by 10 we estimate that our annual operating income margin would change by
     approximately 12 million our sensitivity to changes in commodity prices is complex because each customer contract is
     unique relative to revenue sharing tipping or processing fees and other arrangements the above estimated ranges of operating
     income impact may not be indicative of future operating results and actual results may vary materially




                                                                      69

reporting included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedules and an opinion on the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on our audits
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states
those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects our audits of the financial statements included examining on a test basis evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness
exists and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the united states of america a companys internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that a pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company b provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company and c provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

     3       summary of significant accounting policies
     managements estimates and assumptions
     preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make certain estimates
     and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets liabilities
     equity revenues and expenses we must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is
     dependent on future events cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision given the available data or simply cannot be
     readily calculated in some cases these estimates are difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment in
     preparing our consolidated financial statements the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be significant and that
     present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills environmental remediation liabilities asset
     impairments accounts receivable valuation allowance selfinsurance reserves deferred taxes and uncertain tax positions
     estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in any acquisition contingent liabilities and stockbased
     compensation each of these items is discussed in more detail elsewhere in these notes to consolidated financial statements
     actual results may differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our consolidated
     financial statements
     change in fiscal year

     effective for our fiscal year beginning january 1 2015 and ended december 31 2015 as a result of this change we filed a
     transition report on form 10kt for the eightmonth transition period ended december 31 2014 the references in these

     cash and cash equivalents
     we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents
     concentrations of credit risk
     financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents restricted
     cash accounts receivabletrade and derivative instruments we maintain cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash with
     banks that at times exceed applicable insurance limits we reduce our exposure to credit risk by maintaining such deposits with
     high quality financial institutions our concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivabletrade is limited because
     of the large number and diversity of customers we serve thus reducing the credit risk associated with any one customer group
     as of december 31 2016 no single customer or customer group represented greater than 5 of total accounts receivable 
     trade we manage credit risk through credit evaluations credit limits and monitoring procedures but generally do not require
     collateral to support accounts receivable  trade we reduce our exposure to credit risk associated with derivative instruments by
     entering into agreements with high quality financial institutions and by evaluating and regularly monitoring their
     creditworthiness

the cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to operations as incurred
landfill development costs are included in property plant and equipment landfill development costs include costs to develop
each of our landfill sites including such costs related to landfill liner material and installation excavation for airspace landfill
leachate collection systems landfill gas collection systems environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill
gas directly related engineering capitalized interest onsite road construction and other capital infrastructure additionally
landfill development costs include all land purchases within the landfill footprint and the purchase of any required landfill
buffer property under lifecycle accounting these costs are capitalized and charged to expense based on tonnage placed into
each site see the landfill accounting accounting policy below for disclosure over the amortization of landfill development
costs and note 6 property plant and equipment for disclosure over property plant and equipment
landfill accounting
life cycle accounting
under lifecycle accounting all costs related to acquisition and construction of landfill sites are capitalized and charged to
expense based on tonnage placed into each site landfill permitting acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the
unitsofconsumption method as landfill airspace is consumed in determining the amortization rate for each of our landfills
preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and expansion capacity
landfill development costs
we estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity see landfill
development costs discussed within the property plant and equipment accounting policy above the projection of these
landfill costs is dependent in part on future events the remaining amortizable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop
a site to its remaining permitted and expansion capacity and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized net of
accumulated airspace amortization and projections of future purchase and development costs including capitalized interest
the interest capitalization rate is based on our weighted average interest rate incurred on borrowings outstanding during the
period interest capitalized during fiscal year 2016 fiscal year 2015 transition period 2014 and fiscal year 2014 was 273
62 333 and 256 respectively
landfill airspace
we apply the following guidelines in determining a landfills remaining permitted and expansion airspace
remaining permitted airspace our engineers in consultation with thirdparty engineering consultants and surveyors are
responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills the remaining permitted airspace is determined by an
annual survey which is then used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography
expansion airspace we currently include unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and
expansion airspace in certain circumstances to be considered expansion airspace all of the following criteria must be met
      we control the land on which the expansion is sought
      all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained
      we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor
      we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received and
      senior management has approved the project



                                                                  82

                                                                                                                                          82

     for unpermitted airspace to be included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace the expansion effort
     must meet all of the criteria listed above these criteria are evaluated annually by our engineers accountants lawyers
     managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits once the remaining permitted and expansion
     airspace is determined in cubic yards an airspace utilization factor auf is established to calculate the remaining permitted
     and expansion capacity in tons the auf is established using the measured density obtained from annual surveys when we
     include the expansion airspace in our calculation of remaining permitted and expansion airspace we include the projected costs
     for development as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping closure and postclosure of the
     expansion airspace in the amortization basis of the landfill
     after determining the costs and the remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills we determine the per
     ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at each of our landfills by dividing the costs by the
     corresponding number of tons we calculate per ton amortization rates for assets associated with each final capping event for
     assets related to closure and postclosure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future for each
     landfill these rates per ton are updated annually or more frequently as significant facts change
     it is possible that actual results including the amount of costs incurred the timing of final capping closure and postclosure
     activities our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different
     from our estimates and assumptions to the extent that such estimates or related assumptions prove to be significantly different
     than actual results lower profitability may be experienced due to higher amortization rates higher final capping closure or
     postclosure rates or higher expenses higher profitability may result if the opposite occurs most significantly if it is
     determined that the expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of the landfill asset we
     may be required to recognize an asset impairment if it is determined that the likelihood of receiving an expansion permit has
     become remote the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately
     final capping closure and postclosure costs
     the following is a description of our landfill asset retirement activities and related accounting
     final capping costs final capping activities include the installation of liners drainage compacted soil layers and topsoil over
     areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed and waste is no longer being received final capping activities occur
     throughout the life of the landfill our engineering personnel estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the acreage
     to be capped along with the final capping materials and activities required the estimates also consider when these costs would
     actually be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates the engineers then quantify the landfill capacity associated with each
     final capping event and the costs for each event are amortized over that capacity as waste is received at the landfill
     closure and postclosure costs closure and postclosure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and
     maintenance of a solid waste landfill after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes we estimate based on input from
     our engineers accountants lawyers managers and others our future cost requirements for closure and postclosure monitoring
     and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions
     standards under the clean air act of 1970 as amended as they are being applied on a statebystate basis closure and post
     closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include site inspection groundwater monitoring leachate
     management methane gas control and recovery and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred for a period which is
     generally for a term of 30 years after final closure of a landfill in determining estimated future closure and postclosure costs
     we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace
     our estimated future final capping closure and postclosure costs based on our interpretation of current requirements and
     proposed regulatory changes are intended to approximate fair value absent quoted market prices our cost estimates are based
     on historical experience professional engineering judgment and quoted or actual prices paid for similar work our estimate of
     costs to discharge final capping closure and postclosure asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in todays
     dollars these costs are then inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation which is updated annually
     17 as of december 31 2016 final capping closure and postclosure liabilities are discounted using the credit adjusted
     riskfree rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred the weighted average rate applicable to our asset retirement
     obligations as of december 31 2016 is between approximately 92 and 99 the range of the credit adjusted risk free rates
     effective since the adoption of guidance associated with asset retirement obligations in the fiscal year ended april 30 2004
     accretion expense is necessary to increase the accrued final capping closure and postclosure liabilities to the future
     anticipated obligation to accomplish this we accrete our final capping closure and postclosure accrual balances using the
     same creditadjusted riskfree rate that was used to calculate the recorded liability accretion expense on recorded landfill

we provide for the accrual and amortization of estimated future obligations for closure and postclosure based on tonnage
placed into each site with regards to final capping the liability is recognized and the costs are amortized based on the airspace
related to the specific final capping event see note 8 final capping closure and postclosure costs for disclosure over asset
retirement obligations related to final capping closure and postclosure costs
we operate in states which require a certain portion of landfill final capping closure and postclosure obligations to be secured
by financial assurance which may take the form of surety bonds letters of credit and restricted cash and investments surety
bonds securing closure and postclosure obligations at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 totaled 161095 and
156163 respectively letters of credit securing closure and postclosure obligations as of december 31 2016 and
december 31 2015 totaled 0 and 1000 respectively see note 5 restricted cash  restricted assets for disclosure over
restricted cash securing closure and postclosure obligations
landfill operating lease contracts
we are entered into five landfill operation and management agreements these agreements are longterm landfill operating
contracts with government bodies whereby we receive tipping revenue pay normal operating expenses and assume future final
capping closure and postclosure liabilities the government body retains ownership of the landfill there is no bargain
purchase option and title to the property does not pass to us at the end of the lease term we allocate the consideration paid to
the landfill airspace rights and underlying land lease based on the relative fair values
in addition to upfront or onetime payments the landfill operating agreements may require us to make future minimum rental
payments including successexpansion fees other direct costs and final capping closure and postclosure costs the value of
all future minimum rental payments is amortized and charged to cost of operations over the life of the contract we amortize the
consideration allocated to airspace rights as airspace is utilized on a unitsofconsumption basis and such amortization is
charged to cost of operations as airspace is consumed eg as tons are placed into the landfill the underlying value of any
land lease is amortized to cost of operations on a straightline basis over the estimated life of the operating agreement see note
6 property plant and equipment for disclosure over depletion of landfill operating lease contracts
leases
we lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our business our most significant lease obligations are for property
and equipment specific to our industry our leases have varying terms some may include renewal or purchase options
escalation clauses restrictions lease concessions capital project funding penalties or other obligations that we consider in
determining minimum rental payments leases are classified as either operating leases or capital leases as appropriate
operating leases many of our leases are operating leases this classification generally can be attributed to either i relatively
low fixed minimum rental payments or 2 minimum lease terms that are much shorter than the assets economic useful lives
we expect that in the normal course of business our operating leases will be replaced by other leases or replaced with fixed
asset expenditures see note 10 commitments and contingencies for disclosure over future minimum lease payments related
to our operating leases
capital leases we capitalize assets acquired under capital leases at the inception of each lease and amortize them to
depreciation expense over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term as appropriate the present value of the
related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation see note 9 longterm debt and capital leases for disclosure over our
future maturities of debt which includes capital lease payments
goodwill and intangible assets
goodwill goodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses we do not
amortize goodwill but as discussed in the asset impairments accounting policy below we assess our goodwill for
impairment at least annually see note 7 goodwill and intangible assets for disclosure over goodwill
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of covenants nottocompete and customer lists intangible assets are
recorded at fair value and are amortized based on the economic benefit provided or using the straightline method over their
estimated useful lives covenants nottocompete and customer lists are typically amortized over a term of no more than 10
years see note 7 goodwill and intangible assets for disclosure over intangible assets
investments in unconsolidated entities
investments in unconsolidated entities over which we have significant influence over the investees operating and financing
activities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting investments in affiliates in which we do not have the ability
to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financing activities are accounted for under the cost method of
accounting as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we had no investments accounted for under the equity method
of accounting



                                                                84

     we monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down
     to their fair value when otherthantemporary declines exist fair value is generally based on i other thirdparty investors
     recent transactions in the securities ii other information available regarding the current market for similar assets andor iii a
     market or income approach as deemed appropriate
     when we assess the carrying value of our investments for potential impairment determining the fair value of our investments is
     reliant upon the availability of market information andor other information provided by thirdparties to be able to develop an
     estimate of fair value considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value
     accordingly our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we or other holders of these investments could
     realize in a current market exchange the use of different assumptions andor estimation methodologies could have a
     significant effect on the estimated fair values the current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts

     greenfiber in the fiscal year ended april 30 2001 we entered into a joint venture agreement with louisianapacific
     corporation lp to combine our respective cellulose insulation businesses into a single operating entity us greenfiber
     llc greenfiber in fiscal year 2014 we and lp executed a purchase and sale agreement with a limited liability company
     formed by tenex capital partners lp pursuant to which we and lp agreed to sell our membership interests in greenfiber for
     total cash consideration of 18000 plus an expected working capital true up less any indebtedness and other unpaid transaction
     costs of greenfiber as of the closing date the transaction was completed in fiscal year 2014 for 19194 in gross cash
     proceeds including a 1194 working capital adjustment after netting indebtedness of greenfiber and transaction costs our
     portion of the net cash proceeds based on our 50 membership interest amounted to 3442 after considering the 593 impact
     of our unrealized losses relating to derivative instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our investment in
     greenfiber we recorded a gain on sale of equity method investment of 593 in fiscal year 2014 we had previously accounted
     for our 50 membership interest in greenfiber using the equity method of accounting
     tompkins in the fiscal year ended april 30 2012 we finalized the terms of a joint venture agreement with fcr llc fcr
     to form tompkins county recycling llc tompkins a joint venture that operates a material recovery facility mrf
     located in tompkins county new york and processes and sells commodities delivered to the tompkins mrf in fiscal year
     2014 we purchased the remaining 50 membership interest of tompkins for total cash consideration of 425 the acquisition
     date fair value of our investment in tompkins which was determined using the cost approach based on an assessment of the
     price to purchase the acquired assets of tompkins prior to the acquisition date was 300 we recognized a 106 gain through
     loss from equity method investments due to the remeasurement in fiscal year 2014 as a result of the purchase we no longer
     account for our investment in tompkins using the equity method of accounting and began including the results of tompkins in
     our consolidated financial statements
     fair value of financial instruments
     our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents accounts receivabletrade restricted cash and investments held in
     trust on deposit with various banks as collateral for our obligations relative to our landfill final capping closure and post
     closure costs and restricted cash reserved to finance certain capital projects interest rate derivatives trade payables and long
     term debt accounting standards include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and
     establish a fair value hierarchy the threetier hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to
     which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market each fair value measurement is reported in one of three
     levels level 1 defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 defined as inputs
     other than level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities and
     level 3 defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data see note 9 longterm debt and capital

     business combinations
     we acquire businesses in the waste industry including nonhazardous waste collection transfer station recycling and disposal
     operations as part of our growth strategy businesses are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of
     acquisition

we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition
date fair values we measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of a the aggregate of the fair
value of consideration transferred the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree if any and the acquisition date
fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any over b the fair value of net assets acquired and
liabilities assumed if information about facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date is incomplete by the end of
the reporting period in which a business combination occurs we will report provisional amounts for the items for which the
accounting is incomplete the measurement period ends once we receive the information we were seeking however this
period will not extend beyond one year from the acquisition date any material adjustments recognized during the measurement
period will be recognized retrospectively in the consolidated financial statements of the current period all acquisition related
transaction and restructuring costs are to be expensed as incurred see note 4 business combinations for disclosure over
business acquisitions
environmental remediation liabilities
we have recorded environmental remediation liabilities representing our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for
which we have determined that a liability is probable these liabilities include potentially responsible party investigations
settlements certain legal and consultant fees as well as costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up such as
materials and incremental internal costs directly related to the remedy we provide for expenses associated with environmental
remediation obligations when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated we estimate costs required to
remediate sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred based on sitespecific facts and circumstances estimates
of the cost for the likely remedy are developed using thirdparty environmental engineers or other service providers where we
believe that both the amount of a particular environmental remediation liability and timing of payments are reliably
determinable we inflate the cost in current dollars until the expected time of payment and discount the cost to present value
see note 10 commitments and contingencies for disclosure over environmental remediation liabilities
selfinsurance liabilities and related costs
we are selfinsured for vehicles and workers compensation with reinsurance coverage limiting our maximum exposure our
maximum exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the workers compensation plan was 1000 per individual event our maximum
exposure in fiscal year 2016 under the automobile plan was 1200 per individual event the liability for unpaid claims and
associated expenses including incurred but not reported losses is determined by management with the assistance of a third
party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability we use a thirdparty to track and evaluate
actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation the actuarially determined
liability is calculated based on historical data which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims our self
insurance reserves totaled 13707 and 11560 as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively our estimated
accruals for these liabilities could be significantly different than our ultimate obligations if variables such as the frequency or
severity of future events differ significantly from our assumptions
income taxes
we use estimates to determine our provision for income taxes and related assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance
recorded against our net deferred tax assets valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may
not be realized for certain deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax
consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities calculated using
currently enacted tax rates we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be
realized in making this determination we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversals
of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent financial operations in the event
we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded
amount we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes
we account for income tax uncertainties according to guidance on the recognition derecognition and measurement of potential
tax benefits associated with tax positions we recognize interest and penalties relating to income tax matters as a component of
income tax expense see note 14 income taxes for disclosure related to income taxes
derivatives and hedging
we account for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with derivatives and hedging accounting guidance that
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair
value the guidance also requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met our objective for utilizing derivative instruments is to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in
cash flows due to changes in the commodity prices of recycled paper and adverse movements in interest rates



                                                                 86

                                                                                                                                      86

     our strategy to hedge against fluctuations in the commodity prices of recycled paper is to enter into hedges to mitigate the
     variability in cash flows generated from the sales of recycled paper at floating prices resulting in a fixed price being received
     from these sales we evaluate the hedges and ensure that these instruments qualify for hedge accounting pursuant to derivative
     and hedging guidance designated as effective cash flow hedges the change in the fair value of these derivatives is recorded in
     our stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income until the hedged item is settled and
     recognized as part of commodity revenue
     if the price per short ton of the underlying commodity as reported on the official board market is less than the contract price
     per short ton we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional tons from
     the respective counterparty if the price per short ton of the underlying commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton we
     pay the calculated difference to the counterparty
     the fair value of commodity hedges are obtained or derived from our counterparties using valuation models that take into
     consideration market price assumptions for commodities based on underlying active markets we were not party to any
     commodity hedge contracts as of december 31 2016
     our strategy to hedge against fluctuations in variable interest rates involves entering into interest rate derivative agreements to
     hedge against adverse movements in interest rates for interest rate derivatives deemed to be effective cash flow hedges the
     change in fair value is recorded in our stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income
     and included in interest expense at the same time as interest expense is affected by the hedged transaction differences paid or
     received over the life of the agreements are recorded as additions to or reductions of interest expense on the underlying debt
     we were not party to any interest rate derivative agreements deemed to be effective cash flow hedges as of december 31 2016
     for interest rate derivatives deemed to be ineffective cash flow hedges the change in fair value is recorded through earnings
     and included in loss gain on derivative instruments we were party to one interest rate swap deemed to be an ineffective cash
     flow hedge that matured on march 15 2016 and were party to another interest rate swap deemed to be an ineffective cash flow
     hedge that was settled in fiscal year 2015 for 830 in conjunction with the refinancing of our senior revolving credit and letter
     of credit facility that was due march 18 2016 refinanced revolving credit facility see note 12 fair value of financial
     instruments for fair value disclosure over derivative instruments
     in january 2017 we entered into three interest rate agreements to hedge interest rate risk associated with the variable rate
     portion of our longterm debt the total notional amount of these agreements is 60000 and requires us to receive interest
     based on changes in the 1month libor index with a 10 floor and pay interest at a weighted average rate of approximately
     195 two of the agreements with a total notional amount of 35000 mature in february 2021 and the final agreement with
     a total notional amount of 25000 matures in february 2022
     contingent liabilities
     we are subject to various legal proceedings claims and regulatory matters the outcomes of which are subject to significant
     uncertainty we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of
     loss is remote reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated we analyze our litigation and
     regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities managements assessment is developed
     based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies we accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are
     probable and reasonably estimable if a contingent liability is only reasonably possible we will disclose the potential range of
     the loss if estimable we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or general and administration expenses
     depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency see note 10 commitments and
     contingencies for disclosure over loss contingencies as applicable contingent liabilities accounted for under purchase
     accounting are recorded at their fair values these fair values may be different from the values we would have otherwise
     recorded had the contingent liability not been assumed as part of an acquisition of a business see note 4 business
     combinations for disclosure over a contingent liability assumed as part of the acquisition of a business
     revenue recognition
     we recognize revenues for collection transfer recycling disposal and other waste services as the services are provided certain
     customers are billed in advance and accordingly recognition of the related revenues is deferred until the services are provided
     revenues from the sale of recycled materials are recognized upon shipment rebates to certain municipalities based on sales of
     recyclable materials are recorded upon the sale of such recyclables to thirdparties and are included as a reduction of revenues
     revenues for processing of recyclable materials are recognized when the related service is provided revenues from the
     brokerage of recycled materials are recognized on a net basis at the time of shipment




                                                                     87

asset impairments
recovery of longlived assets we continually assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may
warrant revision of the estimated useful lives of our longlived assets other than goodwill or whether the remaining balances
of those assets should be evaluated for possible impairment longlived assets include for example capitalized landfill costs
other property plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets events or changes in circumstances that may indicate
that an asset may be impaired include the following
     a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group
     a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used or in its physical
      condition
     a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or asset
      group including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator
     an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a
      longlived asset
     a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or
      forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or asset group
     a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of
      significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life or
     an impairment of goodwill at a reporting unit
there are certain indicators listed above that require significant judgment and understanding of the waste industry when applied
to landfill development or expansion for example a regulator may initially deny a landfill expansion permit application
although the expansion permit is ultimately granted in addition management may periodically divert waste from one landfill
to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace therefore certain events could occur in the ordinary course of
business and not necessarily be considered indicators of impairment due to the unique nature of the waste industry
if an impairment indicator occurs we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset
group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows we group our longlived assets for this purpose at the lowest level for
which identifiable cash flows are primarily independent of the cash flows of other assets or asset groups if the carrying values
are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset
or asset group to its carrying value
to determine fair value we use discounted cash flow analyses and estimates about the future cash flows of the asset or asset
group this analysis includes a determination of an appropriate discount rate the amount and timing of expected future cash
flows and growth rates the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are typically based on financial
forecasts developed internally by management the discount rate used is commensurate with the risks involved we may also
rely on thirdparty valuations and or information available regarding the market value for similar assets
if the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group
impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment occurs estimating future cash flows
requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized
see note 15 other items and charges for disclosure related to longlived asset impairments recognized during the reporting
periods
goodwill we annually assess goodwill for impairment at the end of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or
circumstances indicate that impairment may exist historically we had performed our annual goodwill impairment test using
our fiscal yearend of april 30th as the measurement date effective with the change in our fiscal yearend from april 30th to
december 31st we voluntarily changed our goodwill impairment measurement date from april 30th to december 31st to
coincide with the change in our fiscal yearend the voluntary change in our goodwill impairment measurement date was
applied prospectively beginning december 31 2014 as it represents the modification of an existing principle based on new
facts and circumstances




                                                                88
                                                                                                                                    88

     we may assess whether a goodwill impairment exists using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment if we perform a
     qualitative assessment it involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that
     the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount including goodwill if based on this qualitative assessment we
     determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we will not
     perform a quantitative assessment if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
     reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment we perform a quantitative
     assessment or twostep impairment test to determine whether goodwill impairment exists at the reporting unit
     in the first step defined as step 1 of testing for goodwill impairment we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit
     which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments our recycling segment and our customer solutions
     business which is included in the other segment and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets of each
     reporting unit if the fair value is less than its carrying value then we would perform a second step defined as step 2 and
     determine the fair value of the goodwill in step 2 the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a
     reporting units identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole as if that reporting unit had
     just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated
     to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole we use discounted cash flow analyses which require
     significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit significant judgments inherent in this
     analysis include the determination of appropriate discount rates the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and
     growth rates the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses are based on financial forecasts developed
     internally by management our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our risk adjusted discount rate
     applicable for each reporting unit in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units we
     evaluate our results against our current market capitalization
     if the fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded to
     earnings the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized
     the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill becomes its new accounting basis
     in addition to an annual goodwill impairment assessment we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or
     circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment examples of such events or circumstances
     include the following
        a significant adverse change in legal status or in the business climate
        an adverse action or assessment by a regulator
        a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold or
        the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment
     we elected to perform a quantitative analysis as part of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal year 2016 as of
     december 31 2016 the step 1 testing for goodwill impairment performed for our eastern western recycling and customer
     solutions reporting units indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount including goodwill
     furthermore the step 1 test indicated that in each case the fair value of our eastern western recycling and customer
     solutions reporting units exceeded its carrying value by in excess of 746 we incurred no impairment of goodwill as a result
     of our annual goodwill impairment tests in fiscal year 2016 fiscal year 2015 transition period 2014 and fiscal year 2014
     however there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future
     cost method investments as of december 31 2016 we owned 54 of the outstanding common stock of recycle rewards
     inc recycle rewards a company that markets an incentive based recycling service in both fiscal year 2015 and transition
     period 2014 it was determined based on the operating performance of recycle rewards that our cost method investment in
     recycle rewards was potentially impaired as a result we performed a valuation analysis in fiscal year 2015 and had a
     valuation analysis performed by a thirdparty valuation specialist in transition period 2014 both of which used an income
     approach based on discounted cash flows to determine an equity value for recycle rewards in order to properly value our cost
     method investment in recycle rewards based on these analyses it was determined in each case that the fair value of our cost
     method investment in recycle rewards was less than the carrying amount and therefore we recorded otherthantemporary
     investment impairment charges of 1090 and 2320 in fiscal year 2015 and transition period 2014 respectively as of
     december 31 2016 the carrying amount of our cost method investment in recycle rewards was 1069




                                                                       89

as of december 31 2016 we owned 98 of the outstanding equity value of greeneru inc greeneru a services
company focused on providing energy efficiency sustainability and renewable energy solutions to colleges and universities in
fiscal year 2015 it was determined based on the operating performance and recent indications of thirdparty interest in
greeneru that our cost method investment in greeneru was potentially impaired a valuation analysis was performed by a
thirdparty valuation specialist using a market approach based on an option pricing methodology to determine an equity value
and fair market value per share for greeneru based on this analysis it was determined that the fair value of our cost method
investment in greeneru was less than the carrying amount and therefore we recorded an otherthantemporary investment
impairment charge of 691 in fiscal year 2015 as of december 31 2016 the carrying amount of our cost method investment
in greeneru was 309
as of december 31 2016 we owned 170 and 162 of the outstanding common stock of agreen energy llc agreen
and bgreen energy llc bgreen respectively in fiscal year 2015 agreen and bgreen both of which we account for as
cost method investments entered into agreements that resulted in the contribution and sale of certain assets and liabilities of
agreen and bgreen to a limited liability company in exchange for partial ownership interests in a parent of that limited
liability company as a result of the transactions we performed an analysis to determine whether an otherthantemporary
impairment in the carrying value of our cost method investments had occurred based on the analysis performed which

     the term loan b facility has a 7year term and will initially bear interest at a rate of libor plus 300 per annum with a

     ratio to be measured at the end of each fiscal quarter as of december 31 2016 we were in compliance with the covenants
     contained in the credit agreement in addition to these financial covenants the credit agreement also contains a number of
     important customary affirmative and negative covenants which restrict among other things our ability to sell assets incur
     additional debt create liens make investments and pay dividends we do not believe that these restrictions impact our ability
     to meet future liquidity needs an event of default under any of our debt agreements could permit some of our lenders
     including the lenders under the credit facility to declare all amounts borrowed from them to be immediately due and payable
     together with accrued and unpaid interest or in the case of the credit facility terminate the commitment to make further credit
     extensions thereunder which could in turn trigger crossdefaults under other debt obligations if we were unable to repay debt
     to our lenders or were otherwise in default under any provision governing our outstanding debt obligations our secured
     lenders could proceed against us and against the collateral securing that debt

we record an accrual for the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate of the possible loss if we are able to
reasonably estimate a range but no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other we record an accrual
in the amount that is the low end of such range when a loss is reasonably possible but not probable we will not record an
accrual but we will disclose our estimate of the possible range of loss where such estimate can be made in accordance with

     portion of the southbridge landfill the town responded in september 2016 denying that the southbridge landfill is the
     source of such contamination and claiming that if it is that we may owe an indemnity to the town pursuant to the operating
     agreement between us and the town dated may 29 2007 as amended as of december 31 2016 we have incurred total
     environmental response costs of approximately 2465 we have entered into a tolling agreement with the town to delay any
     further administrative or legal actions until our work with madep more specifically defines the parties responsibilities in
     these matters if any




                                                                     99

in february 2016 we and the town received a notice of intent to sue under the resource conservation and recovery act
rcra from a law firm purporting to represent residents proximate to the southbridge landfill indicating its intent to file
suit against us because of the groundwater contamination in february 2017 we received an additional notice of intent to sue
from the national environmental law center under the federal clean water act cwa and rcra the acts on behalf of
environment america inc dba environment massachusetts and toxics action center inc which have referred to
themselves as the citizen groups the citizen groups allege that we have violated the acts and that they they intend to seek
appropriate relief in federal court for those alleged violations we believe it is reasonably possible that a loss will occur as a
result of these potential matters although an estimate of loss cannot be reasonably provided at this time we believe the town
should be responsible for costs or liabilities associated with these possible suits relative to alleged contamination originating
from the unlined portion of the southbridge landfill although there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur
some or all of such costs and liabilities
while no suit has yet been filed against us or the town related to the foregoing we have reached an agreement in principle
subject to a definitive agreement between madep the town of southbridge the town of charlton and ourselves for the
equal sharing of costs between madep and us of up to 10000 5000 each for the town to install a municipal waterline in
the town of charlton it is expected that the town will issue a bond for our portion of the waterline costs and we expect to
amend the operating agreement to provide for us to reimburse the town for periodic payments under such bond this
waterline will provide municipal water to certain charlton residents
in august 2016 we filed a complaint against steadfast insurance company steadfast in the superior court of suffolk
county massachusetts alleging among other things that steadfast breached its pollution liability policy policy purchased
by us in april 2015 by refusing to acknowledge coverage under the policy and refusing to cover any of the costs and liabilities
incurred by us as described above as well as costs and liabilities that we may incur in the future steadfast filed an answer and
counterclaim in september 2016 denying that it has any obligations to us under the policy and seeking declaratory judgment
of steadfasts obligations under the policy
the costs and liabilities we may be required to incur in connection with the foregoing could be material to our results of
operations our cash flows and our financial condition we are carefully evaluating the impact and potential impact of the
foregoing matters together with estimated future costs associated with the permitting engineering and construction activities
for the planned expansion of the southbridge landfill against the possible outcomes of the permitting process and the
anticipated future benefits of a successful expansion it is possible that based on this analysis we may conclude that closing the
southbridge landfill is in our best economic interest while no conclusions have been reached at this time and we continue to
be committed to the expansion process we are acting to prudently manage waste volumes into the southbridge landfill to
prolong the useful life of the southbridge landfill in the event we are unsuccessful in obtaining the expansion permit or choose
to modify or withdraw our permit application due to our estimate of the economic benefit of the expansion relative to costs
potsdam environmental remediation liability
on december 20 2000 the state of new york department of environmental conservation dec issued an order on
consent order which named wastestream inc wsi our subsidiary general motors corporation gm and niagara
mohawk power corporation nimo as respondents the order required that the respondents undertake certain work on a
25acre scrap yard and solid waste transfer station owned by wsi in potsdam new york including the preparation of a
remedial investigation and feasibility study study a draft of the study was submitted to the dec in january 2009
followed by a final report in may 2009 the study estimated that the undiscounted costs associated with implementing the
preferred remedies would be approximately 10219 on february 28 2011 the dec issued a proposed remedial action plan
for the site and accepted public comments on the proposed remedy through march 29 2011 we submitted comments to the
dec on this matter in april 2011 the dec issued the final record of decision rod for the site the rod was
subsequently rescinded by the dec for failure to respond to all submitted comments the preliminary rod however
estimated that the present cost associated with implementing the preferred remedies would be approximately 12130 the
dec issued the final rod in june 2011 with proposed remedies consistent with its earlier rod an order on consent and
administrative settlement naming wsi and nimo as respondents was executed by the respondents and dec with an
effective date of october 25 2013 on january 29 2016 a costsharing agreement was executed between wsi nimo alcoa
inc alcoa and reynolds metal company reynolds whereby alcoa and reynolds elected to voluntarily participate in
the onsite remediation activities at a 15 participant share it is unlikely that any significant expenditures relating to onsite
remediation will be incurred until the fiscal year ending december 31 2018 wsi is jointly and severally liable with nimo
alcoa and reynolds for the total cost to remediate
we have recorded an environmental remediation liability associated with the potsdam site based on incurred costs to date and
estimated costs to complete the remediation in other accrued liabilities and other longterm liabilities our expenditures could
be significantly higher if costs exceed estimates we inflate the estimated costs in current dollars to the expected time of
payment and discount the total cost to present value using a risk free interest rate of 15

estimated share price appreciation plus the value of dividends of our class a common stock as compared to the russell 2000
index over the requisite service period
restricted stock awards granted to nonemployee directors vest incrementally over a three year period beginning on the first
anniversary of the date of grant restricted stock units vest incrementally over an identified service period beginning on the
grant date based on continued employment performance stock units and marketbased performance stock units vest at a future

        1 in fiscal year 2016 we only granted marketbased performance stock options which are discussed separately below
      the weighted average fair value of marketbased performance stock options granted during fiscal year 2016 was 670 per
      option which was calculated using a monte carlo optionpricing model assuming an expected life of 74 years a risk free
      interest rate of 215 and an expected volatility of 4310 assuming no expected dividend yield
      expected life is calculated based on the weighted average historical life of the vested stock options giving consideration to
      vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve for the period
      of the expected life of the stock option expected volatility is calculated using the weekly historical volatility of our class a
      common stock over the expected life except in the case of marketbased performance stock option where the daily historical
      volatility of our class a common stock over the expected life is used
      the blackscholes valuation model and the monte carlo optionpricing model each require extensive use of accounting
      judgment and financial estimation application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the
      fair value of stockbased compensation and consequently the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of
      operations
      other stock awards

expected volatility of 3300 assuming no expected dividend yield riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield
curve for the expected service period of the award expected volatility is calculated using the daily volatility of our class a
common stock over the expected service period of the award

      12      fair value of financial instruments
      we use a threetier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
      basis as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to their initial
      measurement these tiers include level 1 defined as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
      level 2 defined as inputs other than level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar
      assets or liabilities and level 3 defined as unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data
      we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of market prices and observable inputs and minimize the use of
      unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities we rely on market data or assumptions
      that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability
      assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis

method investments in greeneru and recycle rewards the fair value of our cost method investment in greeneru was
measured by a thirdparty valuation specialist who completed a valuation analysis using a market approach based on an option

fair market value per share for greeneru which we used to properly value our cost method investment in greeneru the fair
value of our cost method investment in recyclerewards was measured by us when we completed a valuation analysis using an
income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine an equity value for recycle rewards in order to properly value
our cost method investment in recycle rewards

      to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other
      participating employers ii if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan the unfunded obligations of the plan may
      be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and iii if we choose to stop participating in our

in fiscal year 2016 we elected early adoption of asu 201609 using the prospective transition method related to stock
compensation which contains several amendments that simplify the accounting for employee sharebased payment transactions
related to the accounting for income taxes the new standard eliminates the accounting for excess tax benefits to be recognized
in additional paidin capital and tax deficiencies recognized either in the income tax provision or in additional paidin capital
under the new standard all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies are recorded in the income tax provision we recognized no
net tax impact upon adoption due to the valuation allowance position and prior periods have not been adjusted
included in the current state tax provision for fiscal year 2015 is a 180 settlement with new york state comprised of 168 of
tax and 12 of interest new york state had alleged that we were not permitted to file a single combined corporation franchise
tax return with our subsidiaries we believe that our position related to the filing of our state of new york tax returns was
correct and based on the prior settlement related to 2004 to 2010 tax returns and subsequent favorable litigation related to
similar issues we concluded at december 31 2014 that no reserve would be required for our state of new york filings during
fiscal year 2015 we reached the 180 settlement with the state of new york for the tax years ended april 30 2011 through
april 30 2013 on a basis similar to the prior settlement to minimize outofpocket costs the settlement which represented less
than 8 of the potential cumulative liability for the years settled was a monetary settlement without any change to our filing
combined returns in new york and it closed tax years ending april 30 2011 through april 30 2013 due to a change in law
we have elected to file a single combined corporation franchise tax return with our subsidiaries in new york beginning with
2015 we have not established any reserve under asc 740 for the tax years ended april 30 2014 and december 31 2014 since
we believe our position would more likely than not be successful

      as of december 31 2016 we have for federal income tax purposes net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
      98735 that expire in the fiscal years ending december 31 2031 through 2036 and state net operating loss carryforwards of
      approximately 110486 that expire in the fiscal years ending december 31 2017 through 2036 in addition we have 3804
      minimum tax credit carryforwards available that are not subject to a time limitation and 4433 general business credit
      carryforwards which expire in the fiscal years ending december 31 2023 through 2036 sections 382 and 383 of the internal
      revenue code can limit the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards which may be used in a tax year in the event
      of certain stock ownership changes we are not currently subject to these limitations but could become subject to them if there
      were significant changes in the ownership of our stock
      in assessing the realizability of carryforwards and other deferred tax assets management considers whether it is more likely
      than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we adjust the valuation allowance in the period
      management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized
      the net increase in the valuation allowance was 4582 for fiscal year 2016 5886 for fiscal year 2015 and 2581 for
      transition period 2014 in determining the need for a valuation allowance we have assessed the available means of recovering
      deferred tax assets including the ability to carryback net operating losses the existence of reversing temporary differences the
      availability of tax planning strategies and available sources of future taxable income we have also considered the ability to
      implement certain strategies such as a potential sale of assets that would if necessary be implemented to accelerate taxable
      income and use expiring deferred tax assets we believe we are able to support the deferred tax assets recognized as of the end
      of the year based on all of the available evidence the net deferred tax liability as of december 31 2016 includes deferred tax
      liabilities related to amortizable goodwill which are anticipated to reverse in an indefinite future period and which are not
      currently available as a source of taxable income
      the provisions of fasb asc 74010255 prescribe the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet
      before being recognized in the financial statements additionally fasb asc 74010255 provides guidance on de
