arla grows with more
responsibility

it is with great pride that i look back on the progress we have made towards our sustainability
and corporate responsibility ambitions during the past year for example we have further reduced
the frequency of workplace accidents and introduced a work environment strategy that takes a
more holistic approach to colleagues wellbeing we had no product recalls in 2010 and our all
encompassing commitment to the environment resulted in us increasing our knowledge in this area
allowing us to put in place the foundations to make improvements across our entire supply chain
furthermore during the year we reached important decisions concerning our use of certified cocoa
soya and palm oil which enhance the sustainability of our supply chain
    our owners decision to increase their investment in the company demonstrates not only their
trust in arla but also that they believe that there is a prosperous future in continuing to run their
farms in a sustainable way this is of course very pleasing

we work in line with global compact
three years ago arla joined the united nations global compact a global initiative to promote
ethical business practices as a member we are committed to integrating the 10 basic principles
of global compact within our strategy and culture and to communicate this commitment to our
colleagues owners suppliers partners and the world around us our report forms part of this
work each year we engage an increasing number of arla colleagues in our sustainability agenda
through a wide range of initiatives and a selection of those that were implemented in 2010 are
covered in this report

continued responsibility
arla has now established a more mature process for working with sustainability but
we acknowledge that we still have a long way to go during the year we will continue
to improve the processes by which we evaluate and follow up our suppliers both
globally and locally we will also continue to work towards our climate targets and
intend to include our entire supply chain  from cow to consumer
linked to the arla mission to provide modern consumers with natural milkbased
products that create inspiration confidence and wellbeing we will also increase
our focus on health issues through our product range we can inspire consumers
to lead a healthier lifestyle that in turn increases their wellbeing
    it is our ambition to deliver significant growth in the coming years and we
recognise that with growth comes increased responsibility in this report and the
accompanying web pages arla shares its journey to becoming a more sustainable
company and i invite you to join us

financing the
farmers way
in october the arla board of representatives passed an
important resolution which will see 7200 cooperative
members increase their investment in the company
the motivation behind the move is because arla needs
to financially support the delivery of its growth strategy
the overall objective is to pay a higher milk price to the
companys owners



i
   t was a difficult decision for cooperative members and                   money at home on their farm but they believe in arla and
     one which was reached after many long discussions                     have shown their support for our strategy
     because many farmers are under considerable                                instead of receiving remuneration for all of their milk
     financial pressure                                                    a proportion will be invested in arlas development as

cooperative members contribute to arlas expansion                          additional investment of dkk 445 billion over the next six
discussions about the financing of arla have been taking                    years the company needs this in order to fund its ambitious
place for several years the financial model that was finally               growth strategy which targets a 50 per cent increase in
agreed involves each cooperative member making an                           turnover to approximately dkk 75 billion by 2015

milk they deliver over the next six years the farmers will                requires debt financing to receive this the company
contribute a total of dkk 010011 per kilo of milk twice                 needs more capital which the farmers will provide and it
the amount of their previous contributions                                 must also deliver a result corresponding to 25 per cent of
    for the cooperative owners who are already                            turnover
financially stretched to have passed a resolution of this
kind must be seen as a strong declaration of their trust in                 grow or cut back

focus on farms will help
to reduce footprint
arla is committed to driving down its carbon impact
throughout its supply chain in 2008 arla set itself an
ambitious target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
from production transport and packaging by 25 per cent
before 2020 however as 80 to 90 per cent of emissions are
generated at farm level arla recognises that it is on farm
where the greatest potential for reducing the carbon footprint
of milk exists through increased efficiency



a
       s one of europes biggest purchasers of raw                       it was not new news to us that the largest
         milk arla accepts the responsibility it must take          contribution to the carbon footprint of our milk supply
          for sustainable agriculture and during the last           chain comes from primary production acknowledges jan

improvements have been made it always comes back to                       their farms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions arla
the old saying we cant manage what we cant follow up                  is investing in a longterm environmental programme
     the initiative consists of two parts first is the                    working with leaders in this field arla will offer all 1400
establishment of a baseline for 2005 for arlas total carbon               members the opportunity to have a voluntary carbon and
footprint because until now arla has only been able to                   energy assessment leading to a personalised farm report
provide an approximation                                                  which identifies its strengths and weaknesses
     the next step is to develop a model which farmers                          members are also invited to attend practical on farm
can use to calculate the carbon footprint of their own                     workshops and over 250 are planned to be held over three
operations as well as identify                                                                             years the main focus of

     jan d johannesen adds that an important                                   the programme has been developed in collaboration
consideration in the models development is the                            with afmps environment working group and an external
recognition of guidelines that exist in different countries               farming consultancy and arla uk believes that it has the
such as in the uk where organisations like the carbon                      potential to reduce carbon emissions at farm level by up to
trust require that such models adhere to certain                           20 per cent over time

     for this reason we have adopted a flexible approach                  doing everyday and trying to fine tune it explains

                                                   optimise consumption relative to need
feed                                               use commercial fertiliser
 increase feed efficiency by optimising the        produced with
   energy and protein content in feed               best available
 ensure a diverse crop rotation with grass        techniques and
   clover                                           with a low carbon
 use more locally produced feed                    footprint
 store more carbon in the soil  by means of      spread fertiliser at the
		 perennial crops and permanent pasture           optimum time and with
                                                    the best technology
energy use
 reduce energy use eg electricity and diesel   biogas
 increase the use of sustainable energy eg     by using cow manure in biogas
  wind energy and biofuel to replace fossil       systems it is possible to
  energy sources                                   reduce emissions of greenhouse
