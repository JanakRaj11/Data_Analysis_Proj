their perceptions and opinions of the group




                                   konica minoltas distinctive approach
                                   from april 2005 to march 2007 i served as the writer in charge of covering konica
                                   minolta as i gathered material for our kaisha shikiho quarterly japan company
                                   handbook and weekly toyo keizai publications it was evident that konica minolta
                                   is a company with a strong sense of responsibility for conveying information to the
                                   public the group is not only supportive of the media and provides detailed materials
                                   but is also active in the area of information disclosure in an era when the importance
                                   of corporate information disclosure is on the rise konica minolta is even willing to
                                   release information that is unfavorable and avoids concealing the truth
                                       every year toyo keizai sponsors a green reporting award and sustainability
                                   reporting award i have had many opportunities to read such reports and i feel
                                   that the reports which are thoughtfully prepared by each company reﬂect the spirit
                                   of each company very well in the case of konica minolta the group has taken
                                   readability into consideration and provides the information in a concise digest form
                                   the group also publishes english french chinese and german versions in addition
asuka yoshikawa                    to the japanese report and distributes copies to employees worldwide and individual
staff writer                       shareholders this is an effort that is highly distinctive to konica minolta
toyo keizai inc                       when it comes to information disclosure i feel that shareholders often have too
                                   few opportunities to learn about the companies in which they have invested even
                                   when it appears that information is readily available the shareholders are in fact
                                   often unable to find the exact information they want although other companies
                                   issue huge csr reports of close to 100 pages in an attempt to convey as much
                                   information as possible i applaud konica minolta for taking its own individual
                                   and unique approach i think the groups idea of condensing the content of its csr
                                   report distributing more copies and having more people read it is a good method for
                                   enhanced communication


                                   more effective publication of internal changes wanted
                                   at the same time however i feel that there is something lacking in the condensed
                                   content for example since konica minolta is currently undergoing a major shift in
                                   its core business the company should be more thorough in explaining to consumers
                                   and shareholders the reasons for this shift and its thoughts on future prospects at
                                   a time when the group is shifting from the businesstoconsumer to the business
                                   tobusiness market creating a tendency to lose general consumers it will become
                                   necessary for the group to have people understand the importance of these changes
                                        it would also be a good idea to showcase the companys competitive technologies
                                   and products such as organic lightemitting diode triacetyl cellulose ﬁlm for liquid
                                   crystal polarizing plate protection and mammography the same goes for the groups
                                   mobile planetariums across japan many planetariums have closed down and konica
                                   minolta is now the only listed company that continues to operate planetariums this
                                   is a contribution to which no other company can lay claim
                                        although toyo keizai provides company information for investors i think it is
                                   important that companies are not overly swayed by investor opinion companies
                                   must not only make a profit they must prove their role in society in the future i
                                   hope that konica minolta will continue to be faithful to its hardworking and uniﬁed
                                   corporate spirit and maintain its emphasis on communication with a wide range

                                          annual prtr awards in 2004 where i served as a member of the judging committee
                                          konica minoltas activities were particularly groundbreaking the group had set
                                          up a computer system to gather and manage information on chemical substances
                                          used internally the group had also voluntarily held public briefings with local
                                          communities while many other companies were doing that only upon requests from
                                          local governments my impression of konica minolta is that it is a company that
                                          prioritizes risk disclosure
                                              i participated in the community environmental briefing held at konica minoltas
                                          itami site in the autumn of last year at the meeting i saw that the local participants
shigeharu nakachi                         appreciated konica minoltas sincere spirit high level of technological expertise and
chairman                                  strict quality control i hope that these brieﬁngs will continue in the future involving
toxic watch network japan                 even more participants and helping the company to strengthen its relationships of
                                          trust with the local community
                                              i believe that risk disclosure is an extremely important element of a companys social
                                          responsibility in recent years reports of soil contamination near factories have gained
                                          public attention this kind of pollution may be unavoidable for plants that have been
                                          operating long before current environmental regulations were put into place it is
                                          important for companies to properly disclose the facts and take measures to try and
                                          meet the current standards
                                              it is also a good idea to report substances that have not yet been regulated to the
                                          community explaining both the risks and the measures that would be taken in the
                                          event of a disaster such as an earthquake these kinds of efforts are the basis for
                                          earning the trust of local residents the same applies to sites outside of japan


                                          the why and how improved disclosure
                                          although focusing on readability may be the latest trend in csr reports i
                                          regret that companies generally reduce numerical and other data if this kind
                                          of data cannot be included in the printed report then it should be available on
                                          the company website for anyone to access it is also preferable to release data
                                          for each site and make the entire companys achievements easy to understand
                                          information disclosure is more than just releasing information it is important
                                          to consider how best to convey each type of information rather than merely
                                          indicating that co 2 emissions and toxic substances have been reduced it is
                                          imperative to explain why and how these materials were minimized
                                              konica minolta uses dichloromethane in its manufacturing processes for
                                          any toxic substance for which an alternative has not yet been found stakeholders
        1 a system which requires
                                          should be informed about how it is properly collected and disposed of
         business establishments to
         assess and disclose the total        thirty years ago companies only needed to consider whether or not they
         amounts of harmful chemical
         substances that they emit into   were complying with regulations today however they must undertake efforts
         the environment or that are
         contained in wastes that they
                                          that go a step beyond what is legally required i would like to see konica
         transfer off their premises     minolta continue to focus on risk disclosure and earn greater trust from people
                                          in the community
