as our business continues
    to grow                                  we understand the importance of further reducing our

                                              program is now in its sixth year and while we have had
                                              both successes and challenges we remain committed to
                                              doing the right thing

                                              we continue to integrate sustainable practices into our
                                              business  from operations to product design our
                                              green teams play an integral role in driving initiatives at
                                              our manufacturing sites  from finding reuse and recycle
                                              streams for our waste to implementing process
                                              improvements that make us more efficient to educating
                                              associates on what we can do at work and at home to
                                              reduce our environmental footprint

                                              while our focus has been on operations over the course
                                              of the last six years we are realizing the even greater
    importance of reaching toward our aspiration to create ecologically intelligent products in the
    future we will put greater emphasis on collaborating with our supply chain and our customers to
    develop products that are more environmentally sustainable

    as in our previous reports we have provided a transparent view of our progress towards our
    sustainability targets transparency drives us internally and allows our stakeholders to understand
    our achievements and our challenges

2014 highlights

energy
our springdale ark facility continued to install motionsensing highefficiency lighting in the
warehouse space as well as upgrade external lighting from halide to leds in the coming year
the springdale facility will put reflective window films on all remaining exterior windows to help
reduce air conditioning requirements additionally springdale will be adding air ducts to utilize
exhaust heat from compressors to heat the warehouse during cooler months

our booneville ark facility continued to replace halide lights throughout the facility with
energyefficient led and fluorescent lighting




greenhouse gas
our montville nj facility replaced two propane forklifts with batteryelectric models montville
will continue adopting batteryelectric forklifts in 2015 and tentatively expects to have the entire
fleet replaced by 2016

our booneville ark facility completed the expansion of their geothermal heating and cooling
system the expansion allows a larger part of the production facility as well as the break room to
utilize the geothermal system for temperature control the 12 million square foot plant is the
largest production facility to be heated and cooled by geothermal technology and is expected to
reduce boonevilles overall reliance on energy and natural gas by 65




    wastewater
    our springdale ark facility has replaced all of their lobular style vacuum systems with
    liquid ring vacuum systems liquid ring vacuum systems operate at a lower temperature
    pose no fire risk and reduce water usage and discharge  all while providing a more
    reliable stronger and robust vacuum source
    our redditch uk facility installed a new sanitization system that allows them to use
    less water when cleaning out their solution mixing tanks

2014 highlights
solid waste
our montville nj facility reduced scrap on two coffee filter production lines by rebuilding
the backstands and upgrading the spindles and spacers
our springdale ark facility implemented new shrinkwrapping equipment which
significantly reduced shrinkfilm waste



landfill
our sheboygan wis facility installed a baler for recycling stretch film this will allow us
to divert this material from landfill
our springdale ark facility began an employeefocused recycling program to capture
recyclables that are currently thrown in the trash this will include both the break rooms
and the office area
our redditch uk facility implemented the recycling of glass materials



transportation
through interleaving at one of our distribution centers in booneville ark rockline is
saving as much as 140 miles of empty forklift distance per month interleaving is the
efficient combination of picking and putting away in a warehouse we will be using our
learnings from this approach as we implement similar solutions in additional dcs

rockline also implemented a comingling distribution center which allows multiple
manufacturers for a single customer to convert inefficient lessthantruckload ltl
orders into more efficient fulltruckload shipments

rockline further implemented a deconsolidation center where 40foot containers are
transferred to 53foot trailers eliminating one container being drayed inland for every 4
containers received this will help reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas
emissions from our transportation fleet

in 2015 rockline will be expanding our arkansasdedicated shuttles to include more raw
material suppliers eliminating empty miles rockline will also be introducing new
ordermanagement strategies that will minimize the frequency of ltl shipments




                                                                                                9

  energy
  the energy we consume is used in the conversion of finished raw materials into consumer
  packaged goods including wet wipes coffee filters and baking cups the types of energy
  we use can be broken down into three broad categories electrical thermal and vehicular
  rocklines electricity is sourced from public utilities

  our two primary thermal fuels are natural gas and no 2 distillate fuel oil the latter is
  used only at our montville nj facility rockline procures these fuels from public
  utilities or traditional commercial suppliers

  rockline vehicle fuels which include conventional motor diesel and conventional
  unleaded gasoline are procured from local suppliers

  greenhouse gas
  we utilize emissions factors published by the us environmental protection agency
  epa and the uk department of environment farm and rural affairs defra to
  estimate our scope 2 emissions each factor is based on the mix of fuel sources used by
  the power plants in the regions where our facilities are located

  for thermal and vehicle fuels we utilize factors published by the international panel on
  climate change ipcc to determine our emissions the same factors are used for all our
  our facilities

  we have determined that energy reduction is our best strategy for reducing our
  greenhouse gas emissions

     wastewater
     potable fresh water is an extremely scarce commodity representing less than 1 of all water
     found on earth this fact combined with population growth and economic growth globally
     could pose a risk in the long term as fresh water is a major component of our operations
     including the single largest ingredient in our wet wipe lotions and one of the main process
     materials in coffee filters and baking cups

     rockline seeks to reduce the water we use outside of water used in products per unit
     of production

outside of finished goods we use water for a range of other purposes our products undergo
extensive quality testing before we ship them for public consumption and many of these tests
require water rockline also uses water to flush clean and sanitize piping and other machinery
used to deliver lotion to the production lines each time a line changes from one type of lotion
to another the entire pipe works must be flushed to prevent contaminating any product with
trace amounts of the previous lotion the piping must also be cleaned and sanitized on a
regular basis to prevent build up

our wastewater metric focuses on reducing the amount of water consumed by rockline outside
of finished goods in 2014 rocklines nonproduct water use per unit of production increased
5 versus our 2009 baseline this was due in part to an increase in line trials and process
trials for new formulations at both our wisconsin and arkansas facilities increased trials led to
an increased need for sanitization


rockline will never sacrifice quality to save water but focusing on more efficient water use
even in testing and cleaning is a priority




                                                                                                 13

     solid waste
     waste is the inefficient use of resources rockline defines solid waste as all waste leaving
     our facility regardless of how it is generated or handled our coffee filter production
     generates a high amount of waste because the round filters are cut from square sheets of
     paper even though the paper scrap is recycled it is still considered waste because a truly
     efficient process would use all of the paper

     rockline focuses on measuring reducing and eliminating waste from our manufacturing
     processes to provide better value to our customers every step we take toward reducing
     solid waste relieves a portion of the demand placed on natural resources

  landfill
  all solid waste that is not recycled reused or incinerated for energy recapture is sent to
  landfill the greatest opportunity rockline has in diverting waste from landfill is finding
  customers downstream who value our waste we continue to be challenged by our blended
  nonwoven scrap which is our largest portion of solid waste today only a small portion of
  this material is recycled

  rocklines goal is to handle work in a way that has the smallest impact on the environment

  to calculate our landfill rate we divide the amount of waste sent to landfill by the total
  amount of waste leaving our facilities which includes landfilled waste as well as recycled

  transportation 
  outbound shipping modes
  rocklines logistics team is constantly seeking new ways to reduce fuel consumption and
  optimize shipments we use all major modes of transportation to ship finished goods
  including truck rail ocean and air freight for each of the shipping modes rockline has
  established a per tonnekilometer greenhouse gas emissions factor the factors for all modes
  are based on published sources with the exception of lessthantruckload ltl shipping as
  there is no standardized method of estimating carbon emissions from ltl shipments
  rockline adds a 20 premium to the truckload factor to account for the extra distance that
  ltl shipments typically travel

 2015 and beyond
we appreciate you taking the time to read our 2014 annual sustainability report my first year on the
desk went by quickly and i got to see first hand the challenges that companies face when trying to be
more sustainable

as you read in our highlights all of our facilities were busy working on initiatives that helped drive
down energy greenhouse gas emissions and solid waste and our logistics team continued to make
great strides in reducing our emissions from outbound transportation

as we head into 2015 we know that we will have our share of challenges but we will find new and
innovative ways to reduce our environmental impact and it doesnt stop there

we will use our learnings and experience to charge ahead as we set our 2020 goals
