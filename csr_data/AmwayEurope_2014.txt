the amway business school

employee development is absolutely crucial for amway the continued success of our company depends on our
ability to foresee the types of knowledge skills and attitudes our employees will need to have not just now but in
the next few years

created in 2012 the amway business school represents an umbrella of learning within europe and is our main
tool to help support the training and development of our employees it is structured into four pillars  elearning
classroom training talent development and ad hoc programmes  all featuring highly individualised courses
aimed at meeting the specific needs and areas of interest for each employee

falling under the amway business school umbrella the amway college is an initiative intended to develop the
managerial and leadership skills of amways more senior level staff as well as a handpicked group of talented
people who have displayed exceptional potential for growth within the company in 2013 the college provided
180000 euros worth of training for 114 european participants

the amway college is a four week modular program designed to closely replicate the university experience
whereby participants coming from across europe can attend and sit in classes together and exchange experiences
and knowledge all while forming lasting personal and professional relationships says giancarlo originale head
of talent development at amway europe

the programme was intended to provide handson experience for the participants offering not only educational
content but also practical tips that can be directly applied on a daily basis courses offered include change
management virtual and crosscultural leadership project management situational leadership negotiation 
conflict management being on stage and professional competences

giancarlo stresses that through this training participants leave with something concrete  not only knowing more
but being able to do something more  how can i apply this at home should be the question on participants
minds

it was great to be able to make a difference in the lives of young people through this initiative

educating the youth of today on the issues they will face in the future is an important endeavour with that in
mind the financial literacy and entrepreneurship school for children was developed to help ukraines younger
generation prepare for their futures and learn effective financial management strategies around 7000 children

some 50 teachers tutors psychologists and volunteers took part in delivering the program 16 of them were amway
volunteers independent distributors of amway who became part of the project after undergoing special training
on the subject matter to be taught all of them became ambassadors of useful new knowledge and life skills to
children and teenagers in social and educational institutions in different regions of the country

throughout the programme children developed an assortment of skills including introductions to expenditure
planning and budgeting consumer behaviour and entrepreneurial skills they were put through a variety of
teamwork exercises and were also given the opportunity to practice their public speaking and presentation skills

speaking on the project svetlana kandyushina distributor and volunteer from sevastopol believes that it delivers
significant value to ukrainian youths financial illiteracy can be the cause of numerous problems later in life this
project provided young people with sound economic principles but was presented to them in a fun and engaging
way

at the amway european headquarters in puchheim germany 30 volunteers from different departments took part
in the initiative helping to pack 1500 product packages that were given to the local food banks

speaking on the cooperation with amway and the product packages the food banks head elisabeth weller said
we have a great collaboration going and amway has been very generous with the donations the range of products
has helped us a lot as we normally do not receive these kinds of articles people were extremely happy with the
products

people without adequate money for food will also have a hard time affording other basic household and personal
necessities  items such as laundry detergent multipurpose cleaner tooth brushes tooth paste shower gel etc

describing the experience tobias neubauer amway germany employee special events team and a volunteer
during the event said donating is one thing but is very abstract seeing and knowing that what you packed with
your own hands will go directly to people who really need and appreciate it was a very rewarding experience being
able to make a difference or at least put a smile on someones face with a little bit of time and effort is a fantastic
feeling

our european distributors also got involved in making it a great day daina elvikiene and zilvinas elvikis from
lithuania spoke for many when they said as distributors we are extremely happy to contribute to this great
initiative all distributors received a diploma on the day and amway was presented with a childs painting knowing
that we are helping children and families is the best part

headquarters in puchheim to raise awareness of
environmental issues with our employees amway holds a
week of green activities for people to get involved in based
around the idea that we can all do more to play a positive
role in the environment both at work and outside the
office throughout the week employees were encouraged
to use the cd recycling facilities at puchheim on monday
an employee survey on commuting helped to highlight the
different modes of transport used to get to and from work

surrounding neighbourhood of our headquarters as part
of ramadama  a bavarian term that means lets tidy

danish music festival cleanup




ferdinand brasz business consultant

its amazing to be part of a project thats fun helps the environment and benefits a local charity

supporting the danish ngo julemærkefonden has become a yearly tradition for amway denmark its a great way
for our people at amway to get involved in environmental issues this year the danish volunteering event gathered
amway staff and distributors and their families and friends  75 people in total to help clean up the grounds after
the famous international music festival roskilde festivalen an annual event that lasts for 10 days every summer

during the post event cleanup efforts amway volunteers collected recyclable items such as glass bottles cans
and batteries the money obtained from recycling these items and collecting the deposit fees more than 16000
us dollars in 2013 for a single days work is donated to the danish charity julemærkefonden which supports
danish children that are in need of help when it comes to issues such as overweight social isolation bullying and
low selfesteem

speaking on the cleanup project and the impact it has had on him ferdinand brasz business consultant at amway
denmark explains it has become a fantastic tradition and its very rewarding to achieve so much in a single day
its always interesting to see how a person changes throughout the course of the day from a careful and selective
trash collector to a nonstop cleaning machine all for a great cause
