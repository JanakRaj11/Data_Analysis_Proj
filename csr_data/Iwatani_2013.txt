  message from the president




shaping the future of gas and energy
and contributing to social development
iwatani corporation is a comprehensive energy company focusing primarily on gas and energy providing essential resources for industry
and our daily lives we are dedicated to maintaining stable supplies of liquefied petroleum gas lpg hydrogen gas and a range of other
industrial gases the environment may be a key global issue these days but these are also difficult times in which we need to secure
resources and maintain stable energy supplies as well as protecting the planet
our core business is lpg which is becoming increasingly widely used alongside resources such as city gas and electricity in the wake of the great
east japan earthquake in particular lpg attracted a lot of attention as a disaster resilient decentralized energy source although japan currently
imports the majority of its lpg from the middle east we are working to diversify supply sources at the same time by concluding new import
agreements for shale gas lpg from the us for instance as an lpg supplier our aim is to create a society in which the risks associated with energy
infrastructure are decentralized so that we do not have to rely on a single source of energy to keep our towns and cities running and maintain
lifeline services in an emergency to maintain stable energy supplies in the event of a disaster we need to have secure access to a number of
different energy sources on an everyday basis one effective way of doing this is to use lpg alongside resources such as city gas and electricity
we are continuing to roll out our core lpg centers which serve as reliable supply sources in an emergency and intend to have a complete network
of 36 centers around the country by the end of this fiscal year we are also working to earthquakeproof tank foundations fit lpg generators install
combined autogas facilities and promote emergency bulk supply systems this year marks the 60th anniversary of our lpg brand marui gas which
is already used by 31 million households around japan we are nonetheless constantly working to strengthen our sales network
we also supply hydrogen the ultimate source of clean energy having been working with hydrogen for over half a century now we are finally at the
stage whereby it is coming into common use as an energy source we are fast approaching the dawn of a hydrogen society as evidenced by develop
ments such as kitakyushu hydrogen town which has already entered the testing phases and the imminent launch of fuel cell vehicles fcv in 2015
in preparation for this new era of largescale hydrogen production transportation and consumption in june this year we finished work on
yamaguchi liquid hydrogen in shunan yamaguchi prefecture commencing operations the new plant has become our third liquid hydrogen
manufacturing facility and forms part of a comprehensive supply structure alongside our existing facilities in sakai osaka prefecture and ichihara
chiba prefecture in the future we intend to start expanding our network of hydrogen stations as an essential part of the infrastructure for fcv
and to focus on improving and developing
hydrogen technologies even further
on other fronts we have secured the right
to import helium demand for which contin
ues to increase directly from qatar this
will make a big difference in terms of stable
supplies by opening up another import
channel in addition to existing imports from
the us as part of our commitment to
developing a wide range of technologies in
the field of gas and energy this year we
opened a new technical facility in the form
of iwatani rd center taking us another
step closer to establishing iwatani as a
technical specialist we are dedicated to
resolving issues and developing new
products so that we can provide as many
customers as possible with a one stop
service for all their technical needs includ
ing joint research contracted experiments
and technical development
no matter what lies ahead we are
determined to play an essential role in
society we will continue to explore the
possibilities of gas and energy with our                             chairman and ceo                                      president

  iwatani s initiatives



keeping people informed about new technologies
one of the roles of iwatani rd center is to provide as many people as
possible with information on new technologies in our energy industrial gas
and welding demonstration rooms for instance we show people the
various functions of gas safely behind glass we try to show the features
functions and roles performed by technology in the context of how they
relate to society iwatani rd center is also putting visions for the future
into practice as part of its energy operations it combines four energy supply
                                                                                      welding technology demonstration room
sources  hydrogen lpg solar power and electricity  in order to increase
efficiency we also visualize and provide information on new technologies
and energy operations including initiatives such as recovering hydrogen
used in experiments so that it can be reused in fuel cells to produce electricity

activities with an emphasis on interaction with the community
in an effort to harness the technical capabilities we have available at our iwatani
                                                                                      highpressure gas workshop         technical service car
rd center as broadly as possible within society we also share our expertise
through activities such as workshops on how to handle highpressure gas we
operate a fleet of technical service cars too so that we can respond to users
requests as quickly as possible and interact with a wider section of society we
adopt a technical approach to identifying issues and try to offer solutions as
quickly as possible by investigating the causes of gasrelated issues for
example or providing onsite analysis services another of the roles performed
                                                                                      science festa                     fuel cell vehicle test drive event
by iwatani rd center is to help create a circle of knowledge  so that
feedback from users can be incorporated into new products and technologies

locations prior to 2012 in order to roll out large numbers of hydrogen stations in the future
however we will need to reduce construction and operating costs with that in mind we are
working on a unique initiative here at iwatani next spring we will be opening a new hydrogen
station onsite at our iwatani rd center in amagasaki brought in as a packaged hydrogen
station from german company linde to save space and power the station is based on an
ionic compressor system which uses ionic fluid to compress hydrogen gas as all the
equipment and pipework is prepackaged into a container at the factory that enables us to
install the station in a smaller space reduce the installation time and cut costs we have spent        linde packaged hydrogen station the hydrogen station installed at iwatani rd center

    iwatani s initiatives



promoting new energy systems
2013 marks the 60th anniversary of the launch of our lpg brand marui gas we currently supply lpg to 31 million homes nationwide as well as offices factories and other
facilities through a network of around 1400 distributors having formed strong bonds through communityoriented activities we are determined to build on that to promote new
energy systems focusing particularly on lpg that is how we plan to respond to growing demand for saving energy reduced power consumption and emergency measures
saving energy and reducing co2 emissions in everyday life
    our ecojozu gaspowered water heaters offer outstanding thermal efficiency and reduce
    co2 emissions our enefarm household cogeneration systems meanwhile generate power
    via fuel cells using hydrogen extracted from lpg and reuse waste heat to provide hot water
    we also offer doublepower  wpower  solutions that add solar power into the mix

helping to save power and reduce peak power consumption in summer
    gas heat pump ghp air conditioning systems which run on lpg can be used to provide
                                                                                                                                                                  
    heating and cooling for buildings factories and other establishments as they use less than one
    tenth as much power as electric air conditioning systems they help to save power and reduce
    peak consumption when demand for cooling is at its highest we offer ghp products in
                                                                                                                                   wpower doublepower solutions
    conjunction with bulk supply systems to provide added reassurance in case of emergency                                      solar power  enefarm household fuel cells

stable power sources that can withstand risks
    lpgpowered cogeneration systems can generate power wherever they are used in offices or factories for instance and
    reuse waste heat to provide air conditioning or hot water the fact that there is no need to transmit electricity means
    that there is no loss effectively saving more energy systems provide a reliable stable power source to enable business
    continuity plans bcp to be implemented in the event of a power failure for example or to avoid temporary loss of voltage
    due to a lightning strike as a result they are increasingly being installed in hospitals and other such establishments

encouraging users to switch fuels from oil to natural gas
thanks to its low co2 and nitrogen oxide nox emissions demand for lng liquefied natural gas is on the
increase as an alternative energy source to oil here at iwatani we are dedicated to securing supply sources                     gas heat pump ghp air conditioning systems save power

for lng through partnerships or joint ventures with power companies for instance we handle everything
inhouse including transporting storing supplying and securing gas and are continuing to deal with larger
volumes and supply areas our operations are underpinned by our satellite supply services which
eliminate the need to pipe natural gas essentially this involves installing lng intake storage and vaporiza
tion facilities  satellite facilities on the user s premises and then supplying lng in tank trucks this has
enabled us to establish a supply network with coverage all the way from tohoku in the north to kyushu in
the south we are committed to meeting the needs of industry as it continues to switch fuels to clean lng

for resources we need to secure stable supplies for the future now more than ever here at iwatani we make
every effort to secure scarce resources as part of our unique global activities



  iwatani s initiatives



preparing to increase supplies of helium in the future
worldwide demand for helium is expected to increase in the future as an
essential resource in areas such as the hightech medical and space
industries unfortunately we are not able to produce helium industrially it is
a scarce resource that can only be obtained from selected natural gas fields
to make matters worse these natural gas fields are geographically concen
trated in just six producing countries including the us russia and algeria
with so much uncertainty surrounding supplies securing a reliable source of
helium has become a serious issue in terms of nurturing cuttingedge               helium supply facilities at the osaka helium center

industries and sustaining economic development as a leading supplier of
helium we are doing everything we can to reliably secure supplies here at
iwatani in addition to importing from our existing supply source in the us in
2010 we became the first japanese company to be granted the right to trade
directly in helium as part of a new development project in qatar in summer
2013 we began purchasing approximately eight million cubic meters a year
combined with existing imports from the us we now handle roughly 8 of all
the helium produced in the world enough to cover half of domestic demand
before going ahead with this expansion in our helium operations we estab
lished the osaka helium center one of japan s largest supply facilities in the
suminoe area of osaka with four facilities around the country in tsukuba
yokosuka osaka and fukuoka we have the necessary framework in place to
                                                                                   helium is essential for purposes such as mri
reliably and efficiently supply helium in line with growing demand we intend
                                                                                   semiconductors and fiber optics
to make the most of our network and expertise as the leading domestic
supplier so that we can continue to secure stable supplies in the future

bringing mineral sands and raw materials from around the world to japan
here at iwatani we engage in developing resources and applications for
mineral sands and raw materials mineral sands are natural minerals
produced mainly in coastal areas of australia and south africa and are
used as raw materials in a range of different industries zircon is used as
a raw material in glass for plasma display panels pdp semiconductor             bringing precious resources from around the world to japan

tic market in terms of mineral sand imports and sales for many years
we also import and sell mineral raw materials from china australia and
a number of other countries for use in a wide range of areas including
the refractory pigment and electronic material industries we are
expanding the scope of our activities into the advanced ceramics sector
