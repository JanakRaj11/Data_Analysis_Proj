     requirements for conflict minerals in 2014 2015 and 2016
     signet can confirm that its suppliers reported that over 99 of the gold sourced by signet is from supply chains
     that are conflictfree signet has also reported that its supply chains of gold and 3ts do include sources from
     areas of conflict however these sources are all certified and independently audited under strict industry
     standards to ensure they do not contribute to conflict instead these sources are believed to actually provide
     social and economic benefits in these countries but do not contribute to conflict

     signet believes that section 1502 has been a global driving force in the supply chains of 3tg to establish and
     maintain responsible conflictfree supply chains we acknowledge that section 1502 has had some unintended
     consequences leading some industry participants to avoid minerals from the drc and neighboring countries
     however signet believes that this can be corrected by amending section 1502 to align with the oecds due
     diligence guidance whereby us companies are required to undertake and report on due diligence in their
     supply chains in accordance with the oecd guidance thus supplies from these covered countries can be
     sourced providing they are verified as conflictfree

     irrespective of the future of this particular piece of legislation signet maintains its dedication to responsible
     sourcing we will continue to strive to provide industry leadership and encourage continuous improvement in
     the global jewelry supply chain
