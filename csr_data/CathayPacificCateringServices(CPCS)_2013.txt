development     we     favour   suppliers   who   champion    our   sustainable
development principles



initiatives in 2012 and onwards

our purchasing team has been continuing to work with wwf to search for eligible
sources of sustainable seafood at viable costs initially sources of haddock have
been found developable we will continue to work on that


2 sourcing environmental products
the team has worked with cx to source biodegradable plastic wrapping film for
magazine wrapping        we were studying the film quality and verifying the
biodegradability of the film


3 strengthen customersbuyin for sustainable food policy
the swire group issued the sustainable food policy in dec 2011 the policy
requires all operating companies to rule out the 7 unsustainable foods identified
in the policy both for internal company functions and for business therefore we
proactively plead to our airline customers to stay away from these 7
unsustainable food materials and offered them with attractive dish options as
alternatives




                                       25

action plan for 2013



1 renew corporate social responsibility code of conduct for
   suppliers
we are renewing our supplier corporate social responsibility code of conduct
adopted in 2008 the goal is to make the coverage of our code of conduct
more comprehensive and to encourage our supply chain not just to meet all
legal requirements but also to exceed them



2 sourcing for sustainable products for airline customers
the price gap between the sustainable products and the standard products
remains significant we will continue to communicate this to our supply chain in
an effort to get their support to find us commercially viable options which we can
promote to our customers



3 promote sustainable products via our eshop business
with the prospects that the upscale pricing level of sustainable products will not
lower significantly shortly we will strategically increase our focus on our eshop
channels for the products since our eshop channel targets the highend market
in which we believe is more openminded to sustainable product options
