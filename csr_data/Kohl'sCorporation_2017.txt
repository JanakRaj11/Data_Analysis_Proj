some of our key waste disposal and recycling
initiatives include

o plastics in 2014 we developed partnerships to
  help us recycle plastic film bags and wrap as a

  million pounds of plastic film bags and wrap from
  shipping store operations and customers in 2016

  instore signage cardboard and bagged trash into
  a single compactor materials are collected and
  delivered to a facility to be sorted before being
  appropriately recycled or disposed of our national
  waste vendors provide monthly data at the store
  level for cardboard trash paper and comingled
  recyclables to continually improve waste diversion
  rates we conduct regular waste audits at the
  stores the audit examines the waste in both the
  cardboard and trash compactors to ensure that
  waste is correctly sorted for maximum recycling

o beauty product recycling kohls stores recycle
  fragrance testers nail polish soaps and other
  beauty products products are collected and
  recycled into useful items like paints for models
  outdoor furniture floor cleaners and deodorizing
  sprays
