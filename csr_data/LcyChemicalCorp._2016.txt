customer satisfaction
     our pursuit of customer satisfaction in each business unit includes the following
1   salespeople conduct customer satisfaction surveys with customers who cooperated with the company in the previous year to determine the current level of customer satisfact
     ion this survey should be conducted annually
2   customers are asked to fill out a customer satisfaction questionnaire which records data on both expressions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction salespeople are required to im
     mediately report any customer dissatisfaction to their supervisor and take followup action

    the company conducts regular customer satisfaction surveys to ensure customers needs are fully understood and taken into account customers responses and feedback are im
portant guidelines for continuous improvements in operational processes these surveys are divided into different categories such as product quality product packagingappear
ance satisfaction technical support technical service quality sales service quality customer complaint handling and delivery time compliance

     in 2015 sales service quality received the highest level of customer satisfaction followed by product quality based on statistical analysis there were no complaints about
customer privacy violations or data breaches

    three aspects that received the highest customer satisfaction in 2015 were product quality sales service quality and packaging quality all of which received a satisfaction rate
of more than 90 the only aspect that failed to reach 90 customer satisfaction was technical support the following figure presents a comparison of customer satisfaction between

furthermore the following tasks were also completed in relation to the above                    shows the emergency response plans at each site
1 dashe plant completed the contingency plan for tankers transporting propylene
    to ensure that personnel have appropriate procedures and response measures to
    deal with emergencies fast and efficiently if contingencies occur when unloading
    or during transportation regular drills and reviews are conducted in an attempt to
    enable organized systematic and prompt responses once emergencies occur so as
    to minimize damage and losses
2 emergency responses to contingencies outside plants mainly focus on tanker truck
    operators emergency response procedures and ensuring related response
    equipment and joint prevention mechanisms are more integrated and comprehen
    sive as for emergency response sop for contingencies outside plants transport
    routes and times have to be in line with the relevant provisions of competent local
    authorities for example specified routes for hazardous material transporta
    tion in tankers in kaohsiung city 20141030 when incidents do occur during
    transportation local fire department environmental protection and police author
    ities should be notified

    after 6 review meetings and one onsite inspection passed by kaohsiung city eco
nomic development bureau dashe site submitted a proposal for full work resumption
on november 3 2015 to which kaohsiung city economic development bureau later
approved on november 19 and december 23 2015 for the resumption of longdis
tance petrochemical pipeline  between dashe site and cpcs kaohsiung refinery

     all lcy sites regularly conduct disaster prevention and relief drills in compliance
with various regulations emergency response measures in the event of underground
pipeline leaks are also being taken seriously the company has established a mutual
cooperation system and a plant emergency response team for hazardous chemical op
erations to provide mutual support channels and use relief resources manpower and
equipment this enhances overall antidisaster capability reducing damage to property
and loss of life

     the purpose is to enhance the effectiveness feasibility and applicability of report
ing procedure as well as the emergency response measures of plant where accidents
occur this also ensures greater understanding of procedures to deal with leaks better
response capability by establishing the roles and functions of each emergency unit
and supporting unit in the event of underground pipeline leakage the following table

     22 transportation management
          after the gas explosion incident in kaohsiung city the company took steps toward
     enhancing its transportation of hazardous materials and completed multiple quantita
     tive risk assessments on loading and unloading works these quantitative risk assess
     ments were conducted according to hong kong planning standards and guidelines

     tanker transportation
           the first step was to configure parameters for the simulated transportation of
     chemical substances using 5year average wind speed humidity and temperature at
     mospheric stability surface roughness and population density two scenarios were set
     up for this purpose one of extreme severity and one of the most probable and the two
     scenarios were each assigned a probability of occurrence the transportation routes
     were then simulated with statistical data gathered and analyzed to calculate the proba
     bility of leakage should a tanker encounter an accident
