message from howard schultz
in business success is most often measured by numbers
store counts revenues comps for starbucks these
metrics are important indications of how we are growing
our brand and returning value to our shareholders

but equally important to the value we create are the values we live by


weve been building a company with a conscience for more than four
decades intent on the fair and humane treatment of our people as well as the
communities where we do business and the global environment we all share
we are proud of our heritage yet never before have we seen the marketplace
and todays consumers have such a deep interest in and knowledge about

what companies stand for and how they are living up to their promises not only is standing for something beyond
making a profit the right thing to do it is the way business must be conducted in the 21st century only by doing business
through the lens of humanity can an organization establish a crucial reservoir of trust with its people and its customers at
starbucks it is a trust we must earn every day


for these reasons we continue to broaden our ethical sourcing programs today we are proud that more than 93 of
our coffee meets our standard on this front and through our enhanced sourcing efforts for cocoa tea and manufactured
products we are making a more positive impact than ever before


just as starbucks does not accept the status quo in our business and proactively embraces innovative products and ideas
we also look for and champion freshinventive ways to use our existing assets and resources beyond business in 2012
we appointed renowned community advocate and entrepreneurial leader blair taylor to serve in our newly created role
of chief community officer a true visionary blair leads our community partner resources government relations diversity
and global responsibility teams as a member of starbucks senior leadership team he is helping to ensure the company
continues to make meaningful differences in communities around the world


once again starbucks is refusing to be a bystander as the world around all of us changes i would like to take this
opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to our partners customers business partners farmers and suppliers for their
extraordinary dedication to the hard work and humanity that embodies the spirit of starbucks


thank you for joining us on the journey


warm regards

starbucks global responsibility report  goals and progress 2012


the cornerstone of our approach is coffee and farmer equity cafe practices our comprehensive coffeebuying
program that ensures coffee quality while promoting social economic and environmental standards cafe
practices which we developed in collaboration with conservation international ci a decade ago has created
significant social and economic impacts for more than one million workers and environmental improvements on the
thousands of participating farms


farms and mills are evaluated using a comprehensive scorecard of more than 200 indicators by thirdparty
verification organizations which are overseen by scs global services in 2012 90 of our coffee was cafe
practices verified


purchasing thirdparty certified or verified coffees not only meets our customers expectations but can also help
protect the environment and the livelihood of farmers in coffeegrowing regions we have offered fairtrade coffee
since 2000 and remain one of the largest purchasers of fairtrade certified coffee in the world in 2012 444 million
pounds 81  of our coffee purchases were fairtrade certified we also purchased 87 million pounds 16 of
certified organic coffee in 2012


in 2012 93  of our coffee was ethically sourced through cafe practices fairtrade andor other externally verified
or certified programs with some coffees receiving multiple verifications or certifications it is our goal that by 2015
100  of our coffee will be sourced this way


another important component of our approach is a green coffee pricing model that aims to pay the prices premium
quality commands while fostering price stability and mutually beneficial relationships with suppliers starbucks
sourced 545 million pounds of premium quality green unroasted coffee from 29 countries in 2012 and paid an
average price of 256 per pound in 2012 98 of our contracts included an economic transparency clause


tea
in a similar way we approach responsible coffee sourcing we are committed to a longterm strategy of ethical tea
sourcing which includes helping support farmers and their communities throughout our tea supply chain we have
been working with the ethical tea partnership etp since 2005 to collaborate with others in the tea industry and to
make sure that our tea is produced in a socially responsible way in 2012 we strategically sourced from estates that
are a part of the etp program and subject to thirdparty independent audit on the social and environmental criteria
outlined in the etp global standard


our work with etp is complemented by our support of the chai community health and advancement initiative
project with mercy corps in 2012 we celebrated the 10year anniversary of chai since 2003 chai has directly
impacted 75000 people and their families in more than 200 farming communities in india and guatemala


cocoa
our approach to buying cocoa is also based on a commitment to ensuring a longterm supply of highquality
ethically sourced cocoa while contributing positively to the environment and to cocoafarming communities
our cocoa practices program seeks to verify the supply chain for the cocoa beans used in our beverages with
inspections performed by independent verifiers overseen by scs global services


store merchandise
were also committed to social responsibility standards for the merchandise furniture and other items found in our
stores weve set strong standards for our suppliers and offer them assistance when corrections need to be made to
their business practices adherence to those standards informs our sourcing decisions and ensures we are working
with suppliers who share our commitment to ethical sourcing our buyers work directly with suppliers negotiating
contracts for the products we need in our operations or sell to our customers


in 2012 we assessed 128 factories and found that 36 of them failed our zerotolerance standards even though our
approach is to work with suppliers to correct the issues there are times when we halt business due to the nature
of the issues and until adequate resolution takes place while we were able to implement improvement plans with
almost half of these factories we discontinued working with 15 factories as suppliers for standards issues since
starting the program in 2006 we have engaged in more than 500 factory assessments and continue to work with
more than 70 factories on programs to improve standards
                                                                                                                            4

starbucks global responsibility report  goals and progress 2012


reducing our environmental impact




our comprehensive approach to reducing our environmental impact means
looking at all aspects of our business how they intersect and how we can
integrate new solutions to create meaningful and sustained change

beyond the proactive efforts within our control the realities of climate change are a growing challenge and we felt
the impact during 2012  the hottest year on record from coffeegrowing conditions in costa rica to the increased
electricity needed to power our stores we need to consider the global impact of our actions


by building more energyefficient stores and facilities conserving the energy and water we use and purchasing
renewable energy credits we are pushing ourselves to reduce the environmental footprint of our business operations
we are also working in critical areas of our supply chain to mitigate our impacts and adapt to a changing climate this
is to ensure the longterm sustainability of our business and the health of the communities we touch


but its about more than just our operations and supply chain we are also working to shrink our environmental
footprint and meet the expectations of our customers by reducing the waste associated with our cups increasing
recycling and incorporating green design into our stores


we also know that the magnitude and complexity of addressing climate change requires us to think beyond the
actions of our own company as a result we are committed to continue using the power of our voice to champion
progressive climate policies in partnership with other likeminded businesses and organizations

leed certification
starbucks has been a leader for more than a decade in the development and implementation of a scalable green
building program for retail companies like ours


we joined the us green building council usgbc in 2001 and collaborated with them to help develop the leed
leadership in energy and environmental design for retail rating system an effort that incorporated retail business
strategies into the leed for new construction and commercial interiors rating systems


we opened our first leedcertified store in 2005 in 2009 starbucks became one of the first retailers to join usgbcs
leed volume certification pilot program


as the first retail company to take this building approach globally weve experienced success in some geographic
areas and challenges in others in 2012 we built 69 percent of our new global companyowned stores to achieve leed
but had difficulty applying leed in regions where the program is not as established going forward we will explore
additional strategies to bring 100 of our stores to a sustainable building standard

reducing waste with reusable cups
reusable cups are an important component of our overall waste reduction strategy since 1985 weve rewarded our
customers with a discount when they bring in personal tumblers and we have a goal to serve 5 of the beverages
made in our stores in tumblers and mugs brought in by our customers


in 2012 customers brought their own tumblers into our stores 358 million times saving more than 16 million pounds
of paper from landfills although customers brought in their personal mugs 16 million more times in 2012 over
the previous year the percentage of customers choosing reusable mugs remained flat from last year in previous
years we calculated the percentage of customer tumbler use over total transactions in collecting data from our
stores around the world and analyzing customer behavior we determined that a better measurement of this goal is
to calculate the percentage of times a personal cuptumbler is used over our total beverage sales which is a more
precise measure of the total beverages we sell


well continue to find innovative ways to engage customers to work with us to reduce waste including launching a
1 reusable cup in the us and canada in 2013 with plans to expand to other markets we challenge ourselves our
partners in our support centers and our stores to use reusable cups and remain committed to exploring new ways to
reduce our cup waste

forest conservation
we are concerned about the impacts of climate change especially in the sensitive bioregions where coffee is grown
to better understand the risk to farming communities and our supply chain we work with conservation international
ci and farmers in three unique coffeeproducing communities together we are working to identify and test effective
strategies for improving the sustainability of coffee production processes the conservation and restoration of natural
habitat and opportunities to facilitate farmer access to forest carbon markets or other forms of assistance


in chiapas mexico we engaged more than 200 farmers in 23 communities and helped them protect 10 species of
plants in nearly 500000 hectares in three protected area reserves capturing the carbon value of this investment in
tree plantings has helped farmers receive additional income in the form of payments for carbon credits  creating the
equivalent of 22 new jobs and representing an average of nearly 27 of a participating farmers income


in sumatra indonesia we are continually exploring the feasibility of a forest carbon market program with local and
regional government organizations to lay the groundwork for the future we are investing in the development of the
aceh tengah coffee climate change adaption plan building the first of six nurseries in 2012 organizing climate
mitigation and adaption trainings for farmers and establishing plans to plant 300000 trees by 2013


we expanded the partnership to the minas gerais region in brazils atlantic forest for the first time in 2012 and
distributed 200000 native tree seedlings to farmers we are helping farmers gain access to existing government
programs that provide cash incentives for forest preservation and restoration we are also conducting research to
better understand opportunities for improved productivity increased income and resilience to climate change


testing these approaches in different regions helps us refine our strategies so they can be applied to other coffee
growing communities and replicated by other government and industry partners

engaging youth
as we engage in communities in the present we are also planning for the future were helping develop the next
generation of extraordinary leaders through our youth action grants these investments help young people learn
the skills required for our changing global economy such as business savvy social conscience and collaborative
communication


when we created the youth action program in 2008 we set an ambitious goal of engaging 50000 young people
by 2015 for each of the past three years we have exceeded this goal these youth leaders in turn mobilized more
than 18 million hours of community service in 2012 and created ripples of change in communities around the world
as we look to the future with our youth leadership grants we hope to help the next generation of leaders to build
successful and socially responsible businesses and nonprofit organizations

serve as the hub of our community service and training programs that promote leadership and job and lifeskill
development

los angeles we opened a third store in houston texas in early fiscal 2013

revitalization programs focused on education safety housing health and employment as we celebrate the first year
of community stores we are pleased with the personal and financial impacts they have made in these neighborhoods
these stores have shed light on the role our stores can play in creating community connection


farming communities
our commitment to communities extends beyond our stores to include the regions that supply our coffee tea and
cocoa starbucks invests in programs designed to strengthen local economic and social development we are working
collaboratively with nongovernmental organizations that have experience and expertise in working with farming
communities

a reality starting in 2012 we have integrated diversity and inclusion into the core of our leadership competencies
we expect that all leaders within starbucks practice behaviors that demonstrate inclusion the new leadership
competency reads that as leaders we will reach out to leverage diverse points of view talents and capabilities
work and think across teams functions and businesses across markets channels and organizations across cultures
and communities across physical and digital spaces


to strengthen these efforts we also collaborate with diverse professional organizations nonprofit organizations

about the 2012 starbucks
responsibility report
scope
the report for fiscal 2012 focuses on our performance against the goals we set in 2008 in three areas ethical sourcing
environmental stewardship and community involvement weve also included helpful links to information and
resources publicly available on starbuckscom regarding our financial corporate governance workplace and diversity
policies and performance


in developing this report weve covered topics and issues that are important to starbucks and our stakeholders
based on feedback from sources like mystarbucksidea customer feedback via our customer service center
and industry analysis conducted by sustainability and edelman along with direct conversations with the many
organizations we work with we share information about those topics in the body of the report or direct readers to
other resources


our report has also been guided by the global reporting initiative g3 guidelines a set of internationally recognized
sustainability reporting standards these key criteria are outlined in our gri index


a highlevel summary of our progress toward our commitments and public goals are contained in our global
responsibility scorecard 2012


boundaries
our global responsibility report for fiscal year 2012 focuses on the work we are doing in ethical sourcing community
involvement and environmental stewardship these areas are where we can have the greatest impact we also believe
they are important to starbucks our customers our partners employees nongovernmental organizations and
investors


we also know wellness and workplace policies are of considerable interest to our stakeholders furthermore we have
always embraced diversity as an essential component in the way we do business we are currently innovating our
diversity strategy to support our multichannel multibrand global expansion


while our commitments are global our report content is focused largely on starbucks us and canada company
owned and operated retail stores and global supply chain operations counting by stores these operations represent
most of starbucks social environmental and economic impacts


a notable exception to this is information on total coffee purchases here we report for all starbucks brands and retail
stores including starbucks coffee seattles best coffee and torrefazione italia


starbucks has used the credit360 system for key performance indicators data entry approval and audit this fiscal
year weve started to collect data from companyowned stores globally were in the process of validating and
improving the processes and information so we can consistently and accurately report against common goals


information integrity
starbucks management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the information being reported for fiscal
2012 through a system of internal controls including a comprehensive verification process involving internal subject
matter experts we believe this information fairly represents our global responsibility activities and performance results
for the fiscal year 2012 external verification is provided by moss adams llp read the moss adams independent
assurance report all infographics related to our goal performance are visual representations of progress and not to
exact scale
