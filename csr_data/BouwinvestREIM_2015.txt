message from the chairman

in 2014 we saw the first real signs of a significant recovery in the real estate sector as transactions in the dutch
market more than doubled compared to 2013 which was already quite a good year it was also a year in which we
very much reaped what we have sowed over the past few years we had a record year as our dutch investments
business unit invested over  600 million and international investments invested more than  500 million in listed
and unlisted funds and because all of our over  400 million dutch residential investments were in newbuild
properties we have secured our pipeline for the coming years


we also took our first steps in a segment with excellent growth potential acquiring the first properties for our
healthcare fund the ageing population increasing demand for various levels of assisted facilities and the
increasing quality demands in the healthcare sector makes this an essential feather in the cap of any real estate
investor looking for a balanced portfolio we expect to make more acquisitions in this sector in 2015 and beyond


we are really seeing the benefits of our strategy of downsizing our development activities and opening up the
funds to thirdparty investors and of all the additional checks and balances we have introduced to comply with
the alternative investment fund managers directive consequently we welcomed a second new investor to the
residential fund following the rabobank pension funds investment at the start of 2014 by 2 january 2015 three
more investors had committed to the residential fund we are seeing serious interest from investors in our
commercial property funds


very importantly of course our funds continue to book solid returns in what are still challenging markets our
dutch investments booked a return of 33 and outperformed the ipd benchmark except for the office fund our
international investments business did remarkably well last year booking a return of 195 on its listed and
unlisted funds with a little help from a strong us dollar


of course this is largely thanks to our strategy of continuing to invest during the crisis that consistency also
showed that we are a reliable partner in the market and that we are serious about growth and our ambitious
targets it put us in an excellent position now the markets are picking up and investors moving back in


the market has also changed and is now a real sellers market volumes in the netherlands doubled to  10 billion
last year as investors are looking for higher returns bonds are at record highs and the stock market is trading at
fair value so real estate has become a real alternative investors biggest challenge is to find the right investment
manager and that is where we come in we have a clear market vision roots in pensions and real estate
highquality governance a strong commitment towards sustainability and a great track record investors know
they can trust us with their capital


on top of this we keep a close eye on our fees a recent benchmark study showed that our fees are below the
industry benchmark for dutch investments and at benchmark level for our international portfolio and the
outcome of a client satisfaction survey we conducted with bpfbouw and our first two new investors was very
positive as we emerged with an average score of 77 it also provided us with a lot of insight into what investors
want or need from their investment manager these results capped what was already an excellent year for us


i would like to thank all our employees for their commitment dedication and focus over the past year in a time of
market uncertainty and changes within bouwinvest itself and i would like to welcome our new managing director
finance arno van geet who joined us in 2014

market developments and trends
occupier market
the dutch residential market has recovered in 2014 and the dutch residential rental market as a whole offers
stable rental income after years of devaluations market dynamics are increasing with cities in the randstad
outperforming the market as a whole the office market has been suffering from oversupply and downward
pressure on lease prices for an extended period the premium segment of the office market is in a much stronger
position however with generally stable lease prices and occupancy rates


dutch retail assets have generated good returns over the past few years but are facing a challenging period on the
occupier market there are signs of oversupply partly due to trends such as online shopping the ageing of the
population and overly ambitious construction plans from the past and these trends are likely to result in further
polarisation among both users and investors in the retail sector a1 shopping streets in the major cities and local
or neighbourhood shopping centres appear to be the bestequipped to resist these trends and are the most
attractive investment category in this sector the major cities are also the most attractive locations for hotels led
by amsterdam thanks to its position as the leading tourist and business destination in the country


on a global scale the highest growth is in the asiapacific region with the north american region coming in a close
second the growth outlook is lower in europe but the region does offer much greater stability and even within
these regions we are seeing major differences between countries cities sectors and segments the focus of our
core investment strategy is on stable transparent largescale dynamic and liquid markets


investment market
the investment dynamic in the global real estate market fell sharply in 2008 in the intervening period that
dynamic has gradually climbed back to pre2008 levels investment volumes have now almost reached precrisis
levels after a recordbreaking last quarter in 2014 over the past few years a great deal of capital has fled to core
markets and assets these highquality assets have largely regained a good deal of their value with some markets
approaching all time low yields lower quality or secondary assets however are still suffering from the downturn
the resulting polarisation we are seeing among both users and investors has resulted in a sharp drop in liquidity
and negative pricing however what we did see last year was an increase in risk appetite among both new and
existing investors with the risk appetite certainly higher than in 2013 this is because risk premiums have risen
especially in secondary markets investors are still cautious with leverage and are relatively riskaverse compared
with precrisis sentiment


global real estate transaction volumes came in at around  700 billion in 2014 with the emea and us regions
booking the strongest growth both regions experienced huge transaction volumes in the last quarter us cities
formed half of the worlds top 20 investment destinations with secondary markets interest growing remarkably
growth in the asiapacific region was concentrated in australia china japan with a marked upswing in interest in
south korea and new zealand in europe london was a very lively investment market and saw transaction
volumes of around  45 billion in 2014


the dutch real estate market peaked with growing activity from dutch and foreign investors last year saw some 
10 billion in registered transactions in the netherlands the longterm average transaction volume in direct dutch
real estate is around  6 billion over the past few years however transaction volumes have dipped to roughly  4
billion a year the office segment is traditionally the largest segment but recent years have seen a sharp increase
in investment activity in the residential market

investment plan bpfbouw
key achievements included the controlled growth of assets under management improving the quality and
consistency of returns the diversification and internationalisation of assets controlling costs refining the csr
strategy and establishing more stringent checks and balances within the investment management organisation in
addition to the aifmd license we took a number of significant steps in improving governance notably in achieving
isae 3402 type ii certification cobit 4 level 3 compliance and establishing a business continuity plan last year we
realised our first investments in the healthcare segment which we believe has huge growth potential and finally
we and bpfbouw went on a study visit to london which was organised with apg


increased interest in our family of funds
the rabobank pension funds participation in the residential fund at the start of 2014 was a first step in realising
our multiclient strategy this strategy was validated further by subsequent participations in the fund by four
third party investors later last year and in early 2015 we are seeing an increased interest in our family of funds
partly thanks to our efforts on the investor relations front our investor seminar and our dutch property tours
commitments of well over  120 million during the past 12 months on top of the existing commitment of

residential fund open for thirdparty investors
pipeline secured by record investments of over  400 million

seven excellent newbuild projects six of which were fully let before completion we have a secured pipeline of 18
new residential projects following record investments totaling  407 million in 2014 that will add 1447 apartments
and 207 family homes we anticipate they will benefit from the growing scarcity of highquality residential units in
the liberalised rental sector giving us visibility for the funds future and matching the funds regular longterm
growth objectives


the recovery in the residential market and growing interest from domestic and foreign investors have led to a
steady rise in values giving us a positive indirect return in 2014 and we expect this to continue in the next few
years the renewed interest in the residential sector created an opportunity for the fund to optimise its portfolio
last year by selling 21 noncore assets for a total of  116 million which is close to its threeyear target for
divestments


the recovery in the residential sector and the very high quality of the residential portfolio enabled the fund to
attract five new investors alongside anchor investor bpfbouw in the 12 months to the end of january 2015

the retail fund benefitted from a substantial increase in values of its retail assets in amsterdam and improved its
portfolio by investments and upgrades of existing assets this reflects the funds commitment to investing in
assets with solid growth prospects throughout the crisis years while retail real estate will be a challenging sector
in the years ahead we believe that portfolio with a good balance of experience and convenienceoriented retail
real estate assets will continue to generate solid returns in the long term


in 2014 we acquired some excellent assets that matched our strategic focus on shopper experience and
convenienceoriented retail properties towards the end of the year we acquired almost 30 retail units in the
multifunctional building beurswtc rotterdam in the heart of the city this excellent addition to the portfolios
experience category of retail property assets has enormous potential in the convenience category of retail assets
we added the new parkweide shopping centre in ede to our portfolio the retail fund made  57 million in
acquisitions in 2014 and intends to upgrade and futureproof several existing assets reflecting our continued
commitment to this segment of the real estate market

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2014                                                    23



last year was a turnaround year for the office fund as it made its first investments since 2008 the fund invested 
138 million in three prime properties in amsterdam and rotterdam the dutch office market will continue to be an
extremely challenging sector but these highquality acquisitions in prime locations highlight the fact that there
are still excellent opportunities available our longterm commitment to this real estate sector means that we will
continue to look for opportunities in the prime segment of the office market

the fund acquired two prime properties in amsterdam the valina building in the centre and the former citroën
buildings in the popular southern part of the city the assets are in prime amsterdam office locations and
represent significant additions to the funds overall portfolio towards the end of 2014 the fund also acquired the
beurswtc office complex in the heart of rotterdams business district the citroën building and beurswtc are

hotel fund on behalf of bpfbouw
best performing fund in dutch portfolio
the hotel fund lifted profits to  98 million 2013  56 million in the year under review the funds total return
slipped to 65 from 71 in 2013 highlights of the year include its  17 million investment in expanding the
restaurant at casa400 as well as the installation of thermal energy storage facilities for casa400 and nh the

healthcare fund on behalf of bpfbouw
first acquisitions in very promising market

in 2014 the fund invested 30 million acquisitions included the assisted accommodation complex hildebrand in
haarlem and the intramural care complex ingenhouszhof in amsterdam


as healthcare moves from the state sector into the consumer market we expect the demand for better quality
services to increase substantially as people seek more value for money we are on the threshold of a new era
where one size fits all is no longer the norm and consumers will require different levels of healthcare and
accommodation according to their lifestyles and needs


the ultimate potential for the entry of market forces into healthcare real estate in the netherlands is immense as
the floor space in the sector is projected to grow to 30 million m2 by 2030 in or roughly midway between the size of
the retail and office markets real estate brokers dtz and cbre estimate that annual investment transaction
volumes in the sector could hit between  650 million and  800 million over the next five years the bpfbouw
mandate to invest in healthcare is  300 million for the coming years


international investments
shift to listed investments improved returns
the total return on bouwinvests international investments came in at 125 in 2014 excluding currency
variations the exceptional performance of unlisted real estate funds in north america 173 in 2014 and listed
real estate investments 23 in 2014 stood out as all regions performed well the total return of 98 from
european investments was a considerable improvement on the previous years return and a sign of the gradual
recovery that we are seeing in this region the asiapacific region performed well with a 90 return in 2014 at
yearend 2014 the average leverage in the portfolio had fallen to 336 from an average of 36 in 2013 however
new investments with a higher leverage level are planned for 20152017 the maximum average portfolio leverage
is 45 with a maximum leverage of 60 per investment the total value of the international investments portfolio
stood at  24 billion at yearend 2014 compared with  19 billion a year earlier total investments came in at  438
million in 2014 while disposals came in at  307 million in line with the growth strategy outlined in the mandate
for international investments exchange rates contributed  137 million while valuation movements also added 
197 million to the growth of the portfolio in 2014

bouwinvest development on behalf of bpfbouw
landholdings represent opportunities
bouwinvest development booked a negative return of 167 in 2014 widening from the 138 return reported in
2013 the direct result came in at 25 2013 04 and the indirect result amounted to 142 2013 142 mainly
the result of a significant depreciation of a landholding in nieuw vennep

the existing landholdings in the portfolio are becoming more and more important again the landholdings
represent a potential of 5000 dwellings



financial analysis 2014
income and costs
fee income came in at  279 million in 2014 19 higher than in 2013 combined with the reduced overall
management costs of  246 million compared with  253 million in 2013 we recorded a higher than expected
margin of  33 million in 2014 up  13 million compared to 2013 the reduced operating costs which came in  07
million lower than in 2013 were key factors in the reduction of overall management costs


fiscal result
the revaluation of the fiscally compensable losses for corporate tax purposes had a positive impact of  10 million
on bouwinvest results this item includes the effects of losses booked in previous years which on the basis of the
ruling from the tax authorities may be offset against the current and future profits of bouwinvest


total result
the total profit for 2014 came in at  32 million almost equal to the average total profit of  33 million recorded in
the last five years


financial position
as a result of the profit booked in 2014 shareholders equity increased to  272 million in 2014 from  240 million
in the previous year the solvency ratio had risen to 88 excluding dividend at yearend 2014 from 83 a year
earlier


cash position
at yearend 2014 bouwinvest had a total of  125 million available in its current account with our bank abn amro
this was more than sufficient to cover all outstanding liabilities and was also in line with the formal requirements
of the alternative investment fund manager directive aifmd


profit allocation and dividend policy
the management proposes to pay out a dividend of  21 million in 2015


phui energy
the thermal energy storage installations were sold at market value to the bouwinvest funds resulting in a
negative result of  06 million in the last quarter of 2014 phui energy was liquidated



outlook
we expect most real estate markets to continue to recover in 2015 and beyond and we are generally positive on
the outlook for the growth of returns from our assets under management in 2014 we saw the benefits of our
continued investment in the past few years and we will reap the benefits of our investments in highquality real
estate assets in 2015 we have a very solid secured pipeline of new properties of around  700 million which will
lead to more participants in the funds and growth of the portfolios


of course there is a flip side to this more and more investors are discovering that real estate is an attractive asset
class with solid potential for longterm investments this is likely to make the market far more competitive and
more expensive certainly for topnotch assets in the prime segment of our core regions on the other hand many
investors are looking for an investment manager with expertise and a solid track record in the real estate industry

this is why we are seeing a lot of interest from investors in our open funds we expect to see this interest increase
in the future and to see more investors participating in these funds which puts us in a very strong market position
we have the funds the commitment and the market knowhow to continue to expand our secured pipeline in 2015
and beyond to meet this growing demand from investors

corporate social responsibility
introduction
bouwinvest believes it has a responsibility to make sure its investments meet sustainability criteria and that we
operate in a responsible and ethical manner we have always taken a longterm view and environmental social and
governance esg criteria play a significant role in our investment strategy this is because we are convinced that
sustainable and socially responsible investments and business operations play a key role in helping us to book
stable returns from our real estate investments


csr highlights 2014
 several success stories in building long term value through sustainable partnerships
 gresb green star status for our three dutch sector funds two years ahead of schedule
 number of best performing green star fund managers more than doubled over the past three years in our
  international portfolio
 co2 emissions for the management organisation further reduced by 40 in 2014 72 since 2012
 first steps taken in the composition of a materiality matrix
 active endorsement of our social responsibility in our hiring policy and through a partnership with homeplan


stakeholder engagement and communications
bouwinvest believes that the best way to engage with its stakeholders is through open and transparent dialogue
it helps us to identify the material issues relevant to the bouwinvest organisation and its funds and to find out
what our stakeholders want and what they think is relevant identifying those issues in turn helps us to reduce
costs futureproof the organisation and ultimately create value for all our stakeholders



csr pillars
our csr pillars
bouwinvest has divided its csr mission and activities into three pillars


1 we aim to be a reliable business partner and meet the expectations of our investors through full transparency
   on our csr track record and goals
2 we endeavour to continuously improve the sustainability of our investment portfolio in cooperation with all
   our stakeholders
3 our goal is to be a flexible ethical and fair employer to help our people to achieve bouwinvests csr ambitions

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2014                                                  27



sustainability strategy and material issues




1 sustainable and reliable business partner
bouwinvest sees sustainability as an integral part of its business and we believe that transparency on where and
how we impact society is a key element in improving our sustainability performance this transparency gives us
invaluable insight into the issues relevant to us and to our stakeholders and enables us to define clear priorities
and set concrete and measurable targets


value creation
in todays challenging market it is essential to be a reliable business partner both in economic terms and on the
sustainability front of course investors are looking for added economic value but now they also expect their
partners to add social and environmental value and they want complete transparency with regards to
sustainability goals and performance and the related issues they find relevant


see the corporate governance section in this report for more details


2 sustainable real estate
bouwinvest is constantly improving the transparency and sustainability performance of its three main sector
funds both at a bricks and mortar level and at fund level we use globally accepted performance indicators inrev
gri and sustainability labels gresb breeam to benchmark our performance and our progress however it is
impossible to achieve real sustainability by yourself


joint effort
this is why one of bouwinvests top priorities is to work with all its stakeholders to improve the sustainability its
assets and its business as a whole we work with our tenants business partners and other stakeholders such as
local city councils to create sustainable properties and local environments places where people will want to live
work or shop long into the future


dutch real estate funds win green star status
bouwinvest uses the global real estate sustainability benchmark gresb to measure and compare the
sustainability performance of our three main dutch sector funds in 2014 bouwinvests three main dutch sector
funds once again actively participated in this initiative which is aimed at boosting transparency and sustainability
in the real estate sector the result of the strategy and actions that bouwinvest has taken to improve its
environmental and social performance is that in 2014 well ahead of schedule bouwinvests residential office and
retail funds all moved up from green talker to green star the highest possible category in the gresb rankings


benchmark international real estate investments
last year bouwinvest also continued its active cooperation with other institutional investors aimed at increasing
sustainability and transparency in the real estate sector we extended our membership of gresb and encouraged
fund managers of our international indirect investments to participate in the gresb benchmark

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2014                                                    28



the results of the gresb benchmark were better in 2014 than in both 2013 and 2012 the response rate in the gresb
assessment in bouwinvests international portfolio was also higher in 2014



   highlights gresb and international portfolio
    the number of participating investors in the gresb benchmark increased again to 68 from 61
      measured by nav
    the number of green stars increased to 15 from 11 for unlisted investments and doubled to 18 from 9
      for listed investments this means that the number of green stars overall has more than doubled since
      benchmarking started
    the international portfolio outperformed the benchmark with a average total score of 52 against 47
      global average with a larger difference than in 2013
    throughout the portfolio the score showed a substantial increase for the unlisted investments 43
      improved its score compared to last year in 2013 48 for the listed investments the increase was
      even more impressive 54 following an increase of 31 in 2013



sustainability performance is now part of our key criteria in investment decisions and risk assessment and we
give a clear preference to investments with higher sustainability scores the inclusion of the corruption index per
country and the robecosam country sustainability index in our internal bouwinvest global market monitor also
enables us to assess and manage esg risks even more effectively when selecting our international investments


for more details please see the csr sections in our fund reports and the csr performance indicators in this annual
report


3 a sustainable ethical and fair employer
bouwinvest sees its employees as its most important source of value creation our hr policy is aimed at providing
the organisation with the knowledge expertise and skills it needs and to develop the talents of our employees in a
pleasant and stimulating working environment the results of last years employee engagement surveys show that
this approach is working for the past three years bouwinvest has booked a steady improvement in what we see
as a one of the main spearheads of our hr policy the most recent survey 2013 again showed an improvement of
our employment engagement score this time to 78 from 74 in 2011


for more details please see the hrm section in this report



progress made in 2014
in 2014 bouwinvest took a number of significant steps to further integrate corporate social responsibility into its
daytoday business and refined the pillars of its csr strategy this is now based on three pillars our aim to be a
reliable business partner to increase the sustainability of our real estate investments in cooperation with our
stakeholders and our goal to be an ethical and fair employer this shift to a more refined set of csr pillars signals a
step forward in our journey of linking financial and sustainability ambitions and strategy to create longterm
stakeholder value


sustainability hotspots
not content to rest on its laurels bouwinvest is currently working on a socalled materiality matrix to help the
company identify the main sustainability issues and devise a strategy to deal with them on an ongoing basis this
is important because sustainability is about a lot more than the environment and reducing emissions real
sustainability also embraces ethical legal social compliance risk and human resources issues


in todays ever more demanding environment a serious csr strategy has to address all these issues to create
sustainable value for an organisations stakeholders the materiality matrix will help us to further boost
awareness of how important it is for us to embed esg criteria in our daytoday business and help us to refine our
priorities and targets it is a starting point to further engage with several relevant stakeholder groups in 2015


co footprint bouwinvest organisation
    2

in 2012 bouwinvest started to improve the transparency of the management organisations co2 emissions last
year we expressed our ambition to make our operations to be carbon neutral by 2020 we have already made
significant progress in recent years in reducing our emissions and we took further steps to reduce emissions in
2014 progress made this year include

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2014                                                   29



 co2 emissions from energy consumption fell by 17 following the introduction of flex work 20 and the
  resultant shutdown of two floors at the bouwinvest office building
 renovations related to the introduction of flex work 20 resulted in a onceonly increase of 28 in co2
  emissions on our waste disposal on a likeforlike basis our waste emissions remained stable
 the use of more fuelefficient lease cars including hybrid and electric lease cars resulted in a reduction in co2
  emissions of more than 11 while the number of kilometres driven increased by 9
 a sideeffect of an increase in our international real estate allocation was a 36 increase in co2 emissions from
   air travel


these and other measures led to a total reduction in our total co2 emissions of 40 compared to the previous year
carbon emissions intensity calculated as tonnes of co2 fte dropped by 81 in addition bouwinvest purchases
renewable energy electricity for its entire real estate portfolio this is part of bouwinvests policy to reduce any
negative impact on the environment and stimulate the use of sustainable sources

human resources management

following the organisational changes at bouwinvest in 2013 human resources management hrm focused on
refining and enhancing the organisation in 2014 with a clear focus on increasing efficiency and encouraging more
cooperation and knowledge exchange across the company bouwinvest wants to be the best in its market the best
at what we do and very importantly provide investors and other stakeholders with the highest possible levels of
service the only way to do that is by having the best people in the right place in an organisation that is both
effective and efficient and that can add value at an individual and organisational level


hrm highlights in 2014
 instigating real change by putting our people in charge
 increasing the commercial focus and efficiency of backoffice processes including digitising accounts payable
  and a new administrative system for international investments
 increasing the awareness of aifmdrelated processes and demands
 promoting collaboration and knowledgesharing through an openspace office business and social networking
  plus intensified internal communications
 actively endorsing our social responsibility in our hiring policy and through a partnership with homeplan


organisational development
one of bouwinvests strategic goals is to increase its assets under management to  77 billion in 2017 but we are
not interested in growth for growths sake we want to book controlled growth combining entrepreneurial spirit
with accountability and control processes we are now under much more scrutiny than in the past as we now fall
under the supervision of the dutch financial markets authority and the dutch central bank additionally we now
have to meet the conditions of our aifmd license so we need to meet very strict control and reporting standards
and increase our focus on the commercial side of the business


creating a clear identity
in 2014 hrm took further steps towards creating this new bouwinvest corporate identity a culture based on
accountability focus and collaboration of course you cannot create a new corporate culture overnight
organisational change has to be accompanied by a change in the mindset of the people it affects the most


this is why bouwinvests approach to change is to put its people at the forefront to make them stakeholders in
that change it may not be the quickest road to change but we have found that the most effective way to realise
real change is to put together small but diverse project groups who help to define the changes necessary then we
get as many people as possible involved in actually making the changes and embedding them in the organisation
people are much more willing to accept change that they have helped to shape this not only increases buyin and
the chances of success it helps bouwinvest to make changes that actually work and add value for clients the
organisation and our employees


focus on core competencies efficiency and control
to achieve this added value our focus has to be more competencydriven putting highlyskilled specialists where
they are the most effective for instance we have a lot of specialists in fields such as compliance risk
management internal audit tax and reporting we have continuous process management document
management and change management in place in other words we are in control in fact this is virtually a
business within the business which is vital in the much more demanding compliance environment in which we
now operate


last year we took a number of practical measures to improve these processes and the efficiency of the
backoffice these included the introduction of the sepa single european payments area system digitalising
accounts payable and reducing administration we improved our quarterly reporting both quantitatively and
qualitatively raising overall reporting to aifmd standards last year saw several measures aimed at enhancing the
aifmd compliance process and increasing awareness of aifmd standards and bouwinvest decided to decentralise
its it systems and migrate from one supplier to a number specialised it companies this gave us an opportunity to
increase control of our companywide it system in line with the sharp increase in investments at our international
portfolio we decided to invest in a new and far more efficient administration system

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2014                                                  31



collaboration is key
the real estate investment sector is a people business it depends completely on knowhow and expertise and
achieving commercial focus requires very high levels of collaboration and knowledge exchange right across the
organisation this will be one of the major drivers of change at bouwinvest in the years ahead collaboration is
already implicit in almost everything we do but in the future it will be a very explicit and integral part of how we
do business


to promote collaboration we introduced an openplan office literally breaking down barriers and bringing people
from different parts of the organisation closer together this effort was boosted by the flex working practices we
introduced such as the absence of fixed work stations for a large number of our employees


communicating change
communication is a key factor in the promotion of collaboration and bouwinvest has stepped up its internal
communications in several ways we now make maximum use of internal media such as our group intranet and
various inhouse magazines increasing the number of internal news items and project writeups people are now
much more aware of what is happening in other parts of the organisation


putting people first
our people and their knowhow their commitment and their engagement are essential to our continued success
this is why bouwinvest places so much focus on its peoples professional and personal development we want our
people to be committed and accept accountability for their results but commitment and accountability are
twoway streets we cannot expect people to be engaged unless we as an organisation show similar levels of
engagement we provide our people with the tools they need and create a culture in which they can focus on what
they need to do


respect people have fun and make money
we invest both time and money in the development of professional and personal skills to create project
challenges and also to promote an active vitality programme with a range of individual sports activities and
collective events in addition to our commercial success we feel that this engagement has also helped us to
achieve one of the lowest absenteeism rates in the real estate industry and indeed in the dutch corporate world


we also organise regular social and networking events for the entire organisation these have increased the
opportunities for internal networking and helped create a much more cohesive organisation with fewer barriers
to communications across the company besides this the social events give people a chance to get to know each
other in an even more relaxed atmosphere


investing in the future
we want to continue to improve as an organisation with the people we have on board and we want them to grow
with us we already have strategic personal planning and succession planning in place and in 2013 we introduced
the management development programme covering a wide range of management skills last years launch of the
development programme for team leaders and high potentials was the next logical step in the process we will
continue to roll this out in 2015 paving the way for the next generation of leaders we will also be conducting our
biannual employee engagement survey which will show us when our employees think we are on the right track
and identify other improvements to makes us even more effective


accepting social responsibility
bouwinvest does not exist in a vacuum and we aim to play an active and positive role in the world around us we
actively promote the regeneration of neighbourhoods in inner city areas across the netherlands both at head
office level and through our investment funds and encourage our people to get involved in social initiatives


on a real bricks and mortar level bouwinvest extended its partnership with the homeplan charity foundation
which builds houses for some of the worlds poorest people for an initial period of three years bouwinvest will
make a fixed donation to the charitys housing projects but we have also committed to getting our own people
involved in initiatives around the globe in november of last year three bouwinvest employees spent time in
mexico with a homeplan team building homes in the slums of san andrés azumiatla in the countrys puebla
province ten families had new homes in time for christmas


on the home front young people are currently finding it very difficult to enter the job market bouwinvest has
therefore increased the number of interns we take on each year giving young people a chance to work in a highly
professional environment and gain valuable work experience

influencing respectful personnel management with business partners has now been incorporated in selection
criteria when tendering for facility management services such as catering and cleaning in addition to pricing
social responsibility is now a key issue in the selection of new partners and is part of our service level agreements

risk management
risk management and compliance
bouwinvest recognises the importance of a solid risk management framework the aim of the framework is to
identify and mitigate risks making it possible for the company to achieve its goals more effectively


introduction
the developments of the past few years in the financial sector and among asset managers have led to calls for
stricter legislation and regulations to prevent a repeat of the various crises the banking insurance and pension
sectors all now face increased regulation and monitoring by regulatory authorities as a consequence
institutional investors attach ever increasing importance to internal risk management compliance transparency
and open accountability to stakeholders


the various cases of major real estate fraud seen in the past have led to a rethink in the sector apart from stricter
legislation and stakeholders that have forced the sector to take action real estate players have realised that this
kind of behaviour simply cannot be tolerated due in part to new legislation and the sectors need for internal
reform real estate asset managers are continuously improving risk management compliance and internal
auditing practices to prevent future incidents the real estate world is changing rapidly and players in the sector
are  wherever possible  making use of lessons from the banking and insurance worlds



risk management framework
bouwinvest has chosen the globally recognised coso framework as the basis for its own risk management this
model goes beyond internal controls and also covers the entire internal management system and is known as
coso or enterprise risk management framework ermf based on this framework bouwinvest has also drawn up
its own reporting and monitoring framework with its four lines of defence as described in the corporate
governance section in this annual report



main risks and mitigating factors
in 2014 bouwinvest recognised the following management risks


   continuity
   quality
   relative performance
   transparency
   management fee


continuity
the continuity risk is the risk relating to the continuity of the management organisation as a result of which the
company can no longer meet the terms of its agreements with bpfbouw and other clients this risk is mitigated by
closing service level agreements with outsourcing partners by drawing up and updatingmaintaining a business
continuity plan and the application of an information security policy


quality
the quality risk is the risk that the management organisation is unable to deliver sufficient quality as a result of
which bouwinvest is unable to meet the terms of its agreements with bpfbouw and other investors in an
adequate fashion this risk is mitigated through the use of an internal process management framework in
accordance with isae 3402 which is tested annually by an external auditor in addition to this a corporate social
responsibility action list is monitored and a business incidents procedure is in place

bouwinvest real estate investment management bv  annual report 2014                                                   38



relative performance
this risk pertains to the extent to which the management organisation fails to achieve the relevant benchmarking
with the entities it manages as a result of which bpfbouw and other clients may decide to withdraw their
assignments from bouwinvest this risk is mitigated by monitoring bouwinvests own performance visàvis the
relevant benchmarking on the basis of quality ipd property index inrev fund index and ncreif fund index and
annually anrev index and by management of the results of the managed entities


transparency
the transparency risk is the risk that the management organisation is unable to account for its activities in
accordance with the timely reporting and quality requirements laid down in the service level agreements closed
with bpfbouw and other clients this risk is mitigated by actively managing the process with a view to the timely
delivery of highquality reports


management fee
this describes the risk that bouwinvests fee income is lower than its expenses this risk is mitigated by identifying
fee income developments in a timely fashion and if necessary responding to same with costcontrol measures



control of investment decisions
the investment committee ic is an important advisory body for the board of directors in terms of risk
management supported by the risk controller the manager corporate control participates in the ic and tests the
investment process decisionmaking and investment proposals he does so together with the compliance officer
and several other of bouwinvests specialists investment proposals are tested in advance against kpis the
fundamentals of which are set annually in the investment plan this includes looking at whether the investments
are in line with the budgeted amounts of the various locations and whether the risk classification is correct and in
line with the intended investment strategy and the goals for portfolio diversification


after the ic has provided its advice the proposal is presented to the board of directors the board will take the ic
advice into consideration and makes the final decision for investments above a certain threshold an additional
approval by the supervisory board is required the exception to this are investments by bouwinvest funds which
have a shareholders committee


using leverage is a wellknown risk factor in the real estate world unlike many other real estate investors
bouwinvest makes no use of leverage for dutch investments bouwinvests international investments do involve
leverage but this accounts for a limited proportion of total investments and is continuously monitored in financial
and risk reports


in addition to leverage extra risk factors in dutch and international investments include business partners and
related due diligence and fiscal matters and all of these are monitored closely by the risk and compliance
functions in the case of international investments bouwinvest devotes extra attention to fee structures and their
relation to a funds performance



alternative investment fund managers directive
aifmd
early 2014 bouwinvest was one of the first parties in the netherlands to obtain an afm licence as required by the
aifmd this licence allows bouwinvests funds to manage funds that are open for other institutional investors
besides bpfbouw


the aifmd specifies certain transparency and integrity related requirements for alternative investment funds for
bouwinvest this has led to an increased workload in reporting on top of that alignment activities with our newly
contracted custodian intertrust group required additional operational efforts nevertheless 2014 has shown that
bouwinvest is geared up for these additional tasks bouwinvest foresees no aifmdrelated challenges for 2015
besides minor optimisation of internal processes

monitoring and reporting

integral part of the planning and control cycle the bouwinvest board of directors receives quarterly risk reports
which report on the management of risks on the basis of risk indicators in 2014 bouwinvest continued to expand
and refine its risk management system through detailed assessment this will result in an improved risk reporting

reporting of performance indicators
bouwinvest reports environmental data for those assets where management control is possible operational
control approach data is provided for those assets where we have the authority to introduce and implement
operating policies and are responsible for purchasing energy and water and handling waste our management
control differs greatly by asset type eg residential and office these differences affect the level of influence we
have over the sustainability performance of our assets
likeforlike data and changes represents assets which have been fully owned and operational for the full
24month period in our investment portfolio it provides insight into the performance of an indicator over time at a
constant portfolio scope the relatively large reduction in ghg emissions is due to the compensation of carbon
emissions through the purchase of carbon certificates this is in line with bouwinvests commitment to reduce the
impact its operations have on climate change
energy emission and water intensities are reported using shared services as the numerator and the lettable
floor area lfa as the denominator shared services refers to landlordobtained consumption for common areas
and any services provided to tenant areas that have not been submetered
