                                                               decided to broaden our scope to health  nutrition we
                                                               were able to better allocate resources for example
                                                               we were able to initiate our health  nutrition centre a

based on these experiences we learned which direction         truly motivated to make a better bangladesh we believe

better sense of which types of projects will work and          especially as we further develop our departments
which will not while we still anticipate changes to focus     standard operating procedures once sustainability
area allocations in terms of budget we are confident          becomes a repeatable process one which primarily
that we will be in a much better position to use our           requires scaling and the occasional new project only then
resources to their full capacity it should be noted that as   will we be confident that our program is truly successful
we are working to reach the recommended expenditure
according to sdg 17 07 of net profit after tax by
2020 the budget for the fy 20172018 will increase from
05 to 055 of npat more important than consistent
focus area allocations we are committed to spending
