while much has changed since hang seng banks founding in 1933 our central
principle of providing service excellence remains as strong today as it was more than
80 years ago

as hong kongs leading domestic bank we are a responsible corporate citizen with our
commitment to serve extending beyond daytoday business operations we actively
participate in a number of initiatives to drive longterm sustainable development our
objective is to help create a healthy and engaged society that will in turn support our
own growth in the years ahead

this annual corporate sustainability report is intended to provide information on our
activities and practices  and to contribute to the ongoing conversation on sustainability

hang seng was back in 2010 the first local bank in hong kong to employ the
internationally recognised global reporting initiative sustainability reporting guidelines
the following year we were also the first bank to achieve an a rating for 2013 i am
pleased to say that we have attained an a rating for a third consecutive year

in 2013 hang seng was also once again recognised by corporate knights as one of
the global 100 most sustainable corporations in the world this marked our second
consecutive year as the only hong kong corporation included in this list

we would not be able to contribute to the sustainability of the communities we serve
without the ongoing dedication of our staff in 2013 i am proud to report that our
employees and their families volunteered nearly 27000 hours of their own time to help
others

in the last year as part of our emphasis on youth development activities we supported
close to 180 education programmes and workshops reaching some 100000 young
people the hang seng bank  leaders to leaders lecture series once again provided
local students a valuable opportunity to engage in direct dialogue with prominent
community leaders to expand the impact of the series we also added a live webcast
for the first time last year enabling us to reach an additional 30000 individuals indeed
we were very honoured when our lecture series was recognised recently with a
gold award for corporate social responsibility at the 11th china golden awards for
excellence in public relations organised by the china international public relations
association

during our yearlong series of events celebrating hang sengs 80th anniversary we
also integrated the theme of sustainability into many of the activities for example we
committed to building a further 800 biogas facilities in rural areas in mainland china

with our deep roots in hong kong we recognise that our longterm success is very
much intertwined with the prosperity and wellbeing of the greater china region to
do our part to help drive sustainable development in this region we remain committed
to providing service excellence building and maintaining longterm relationships and
continuing to invest in the communities we serve

 our overarching objective is to achieve the sustainable longterm growth of
 our business and the communities in which we operate by striving for service
 excellence in everything we do our values are the foundation of our efforts to
 meet this objective they guide our approach to doing business and provide a
 common set of operating standards for hang seng employees

 our business takes place in one of the most dynamic and fastevolving regions in
 the world changing economic environmental and social trends have implications
 for hang seng and for our key stakeholders we work to ensure we are well
 positioned to respond swiftly and effectively to capitalise on new opportunities and
 manage new risks our reputation as a sustainability leader that makes a positive
 contribution to society will distinguish us from our peers inspire our people and
 enhance our stakeholder value



materiality assessment
for the purposes of sustainability our standard of materiality is defined as follows
issues that could have a significant impact on the reputation or viability of our business
andor an impact on a stakeholders decision as to whether or not to do business with
hang seng

identifying our material aspects
to identify our reportable material aspects we aligned our stakeholder engagement
process with the structure provided in the gri sustainability reporting guidelines
we asked internal and external stakeholders to rank sustainability issues based on
importance this included asking managers from across different business functions
and operations to rank the issues according to their significance to our business we
also considered qualitative feedback gathered through formal and informal meetings
this data was then used by our csr sustainers to plot and validate a materiality matrix

our principles in practice

our mission is to be a profitable growing business by exceeding the expectations of our stakeholders through service
excellence based on core values that include integrity innovation and financial strength

our objective is best achieved by maintaining a central emphasis on responsible corporate practices throughout our
operations and finding new and more effective ways to engage our customers colleagues and local communities
how we do business is as important as what we do in continuing to refine our strategy for longterm growth

this holistic approach supports good risk management helps us pinpoint areas in which we can enhance efficiency
and generates new business opportunities it also offers us a competitive advantage as stakeholders increasingly
focus on the social and environmental  as well as economic  performance of companies in the financial services
industry

stakeholder engagement
we use a variety of topdown and bottomup approaches to openly actively and effectively engage our stakeholders
which include customers staff shareholders suppliers and business partners regulators and the broader community
see table below

our efforts to maintain an open dialogue with our stakeholders not only focus on current issues but also aim to assess
the potential impact of emerging andor longerterm trends this allows us to be proactive rather than reactive in
adapting our operational practices and sustainability activities to maintain our market leadership and strike an effective
balance in addressing a diverse range of expectations views and objectives with the primary goal of optimising long
term outcomes for our business and our stakeholders

risk management
the effectiveness of our risk management policies and strategies is a key factor in our success

the internal audit function provides independent objective assurance to the management and the risk and audit
committees over the risk management and controls framework to add value and to improve operations it helps
the management accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic and disciplined approach in the evaluation and
improvement of the effectiveness of risk management control and governance processes it also assesses the
design and effectiveness of the primary and secondary controls and it places a degree of reliance on the effectiveness
of the work completed by the internal control teams the outcome is a holistic and timely view of how effectively the
material risks within the bank are being managed

the risk management committee rmc which reports directly to the executive committee oversees the risk
management framework for the bank and its subsidiaries its main functions are to review all existing and potential
risks on a systematic basis to ensure mechanisms exist for early identification of risks adequate controls exist to
mitigate risks related returns consider risks and that capital is appropriately allocated to manage risks the committee
is also responsible for reviewing recommending and approving policies and methodologies for the management of
risk and overseeing the risk management of its subcommittees more details on our management of risk can be
found in the corporate governance and other information financial review and 2013 financial statements
sections of our 2013 annual report

establishing an appropriate risk appetite limit is a key element in our management of risk the groups risk appetite
statement for 2013 which was approved by the board as advised by the risk committee describes the types and
amount of risk that we are prepared to accept in executing our business strategy and applies at bankwide business
group and individual risk levels our risk appetite framework is underpinned by the following core principles

 we must maintain our strong balance sheet and brand
 we must maintain a healthy capital position
 we must be accountable in how we use shareholders funds
 we must adopt conservative liquidity management policies and processes
 our tolerance for any risk must be commensurate with and considered in light of potential returns
 we must always uphold the principle of sustainable longterm growth

the rmc undertakes regular reviews and monitors the banks risk profile against the limits set out in the statement
and determines appropriate management action in instances of material deviation from approved limits reports that
detail the profile of the statement  including material deviations from the same and where required suggestions for
appropriate management action  are submitted to the risk committee and the board by the chief risk officer on a
quarterly basis

product development and signoff procedures are in place to ensure that the design of all new products and services
are reviewed to ensure they meet market requirements and customer needs all new products and material product
variations must be approved by the product oversight committee as a subcommittee of the rmc

we maintain documented business continuity plans for critical operations and significant risks including arrangements
for backup site operations and a clearing and settlement services contingency plan to ensure that critical operations
remain functional in emergency situations

environment



the collective global response to challenges such as climate change and
conserving biodiversity will influence the longterm health of the natural systems
upon which we all depend as one of hong kongs largest listed companies
we have a prominent platform from which to champion the cause of improved
environmental stewardship

we strive to reduce our waste production and consumption of energy and natural
resources and whenever possible to use environmentally friendly products and
certified materials in our operations

we empower our staff to act as ambassadors for the environment by raising
their awareness of green issues and use our services and policies to encourage
greener practices among our customers and suppliers

we consider the environmental impact of our business travel policies and are
working to reduce nonessential travel through increased use of alternatives such
as teleconferencing



as a leading corporate citizen in hong kong we are proud to be a local pioneer
in promoting greater environmental responsibility beginning with our headquarters
building in 2005 we have led the way in gaining iso 14001 certification among
domestic banks in hong kong in 2011 we became the first local bank to achieve
this internationally recognised environmental accreditation for all hong kong offices
and branches

in 2013 we committed to sponsoring the construction of a further 800 biogas
facilities in mainland china  our largest undertaking since establishing the hang
seng yunnan biogas project in cooperation with the conservancy association in
2007 to date we have helped build 3000 biogas facilities in yunnan province to
provide a free and stable source of energy for more than 12000 rural residents and
reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by over 35000 tonnes



key initiative

hang seng yunnan biogas project

the hang seng yunnan biogas project has been driving positive social and
environmental development in mainland chinas yunnan province since 2007
the biogas facilities help conserve natural resources and protect the environment
while also bringing positive change to the lives of villagers by reducing energy
costs by up to 50 when compared to using firewood the project is currently
saving more than 2400 acres of forest every year  equivalent to an area that is
75 times the size of kowloon park in hong kong

     we believe that biogas facilities will bring more positive
     changes to our environment in the future we hope we can
     continue to work with hang seng to expand this project to
     bring biogas facilities to more rural communities in yunnan

                                                                     mr rico wong
                               deputy chief executive of the conservancy association




     the entire teaching process including the planning was a
     very valuable and enjoyable experience for me i hope the
     children will share their new knowledge about biogas facilities
     with their families and friends

                                                                          tako choi

new steps in our work with the southern china business community on environmental
issues include expanding the coverage of our environmental awards to cover the pan
pearl river delta region organised jointly with the federation of hong kong industries
the hang seng pan pearl river delta environmental awards awards aim to serve as
a catalyst for positive environmental change among manufacturing companies in this
economically vibrant region by recognising and rewarding environmentally responsible
behaviour

with a 20 increase in the number of applications compared with the previous awards
year over 720 projects were submitted to the 201213 awards by 225 participants
collective achievements included cutting consumption of electricity by over 126 million
kilowatt hours and water usage by more than 42 million tonnes


  all the winners have successfully implemented comprehensive
  and creative environmental projects setting good examples
  for other companies under the 12th fiveyear plan on the
  development of national environmental protection standards
  hong kong enterprises should adjust their strategies and comply
  with national requirements by doing so they can not only enhance
  their competitiveness but also sharpen their edge in the domestic
  market
