    topics included in this ﬁrst report reﬂect ongoing engagement with external stakeholders including local community
    members and government representatives consultations with thirdparty experts and feedback from our staff and
    investors given that the project is still at the preproduction stage there are a number of material issues on which we
    are not yet able to report including for example water use for operations or total economic value generated by the
    project we have indicated where this is the case
    as our activities ramp up and our footprint increases we will report more comprehensively and will be able to include
    more hard data on a broader range of indicators we plan to conduct fuller materiality assessments with broad
    stakeholder input for future reports we will also look to set ourselves more measurable and numberdriven targets for
    upcoming years in our 2017 report we will report against the targets set out at the end of this report
    this report is intended to be shared with all of our stakeholders and will therefore be produced annually both in
    english and in armenian it will be available electronically on our websites wwwlydianinternationalcouk and
    wwwlydianarmeniaam as well as in hard copies from our corporate ofﬁces and our information centres in gndevaz
    jermuk gorayk and saravan
    this report was prepared with reference to the global reporting initiative gri but not in accordance with its
    guidelines as the preproduction stage of the project means that some of the required gri indicators cannot yet be
    reported on we have not sought external veriﬁcation of this report but it was reviewed internally and approved by the
    board in june 2017
    we are committed to open and transparent engagement and welcome feedback on how we can improve our reporting

     strengthening our approach


     as we enter the active construction phase for the amulsar mine we remain committed to good international industry
     practices with activities ramping up and a growing footprint we believe in continuing to strengthen our sustainability
     approach
     transparent reporting on and accountability for our environmental social economic and labour performance is a key
     part of this we hope that this report and those that follow will stimulate open and constructive dialogue with our
     stakeholders build trust and help to hold us accountable to operating in a responsible manner
     we have also worked to establish an independent advisory panel to monitor our performance and to provide objective
     and authoritative advice on a range of sustainable development issues the panel will be ofﬁcially established in may
     2017 the panel is comprised of armenian and international experts from various sustainability ﬁelds including water
     management biodiversity public health and socioeconomic specialists and with experience of extractive projects
     aligned with good practice standards we will work closely with the panel to ensure that our performance is
     independently and rigorously scrutinised and to receive the panels expert advice on minimising and mitigating our
     impacts and maximising the opportunities created by our activities we will report more fully on the panels remit in next
     years report
     our work and commitments will continue to be led and driven by our board and senior management with support from
     the entire lydian team in armenia and elsewhere further oversight is provided by our lenders and our independent

     as part of our commitment to transparent and constructive communication we have installed grievance boxes in
     jermuk gndevaz saravan gorayk the construction site and the accommodation site to allow those affected by our
     activities to formally and if desired anonymously communicate to us their concerns and grievances


                                          our grievance mechanism

          grievance mechanisms are a key aspect of international goodpractice social management
          our social manager logs all grievances received in the social management system and then
          works with our community liaison ofﬁcer and relevant head of department eg environ
          mental or health and safety manager to process the complaints all formal grievances
          receive a written reply within ten working days a ﬁnal response will then look to address the
          grievance for example by providing information or outlining proposed measures to resolve
          the issue
          lydian endeavours to resolve all grievances amicably if a grievance cannot be resolved by
          us we will seek to involve external experts neutral parties or local and regional authorities
          as appropriate
          in 2016 we updated our grievance mechanism to include sections on our employees and on
          safety all of our contractors are required to apply either lydians or their own grievance
          mechanism
          in 2016 27 entries were registered in the mechanism seven of these met the deﬁnition of
          grievance as opposed to requests for assistance the entries covered the following issues
          ÿ   two grievances related to damage caused to private land by heavy equipment used by
              our contractors compensation was provided to the landowners in both cases
          ÿ   five grievances expressed concerns about limited opportunities for local employment as
              a result our teams are working to ensure that we and our contractors continually update
              our local communities on lydians efforts plans and activities around local employment
          ÿ   the remaining 20 entries were requests for our assistance in addressing individual or
              family health conditions or local community issues all of these were responded to and
              wherever appropriate were addressed  for example street lights and signs were
              installed in jermuk we coﬁnanced an upgrade to the lor community drinking water
              system and we supported the full renovation of the kechut music school

   gorayk with gndevaz the most affected




   the land acquisition process was initiated in 2014 and has been conducted in compliance with armenian law
   and the stringent land acquisition and compensation standards set by ifc and ebrd we ensured engagement
   with affected households throughout each phase of the process and held meetings in gorayk saravan and
   gndevaz with farmers mayors and other community members to provide updates share project maps present
   compensation rates and collect feedback on the process

     as of fall 2016 all 278 private land plots required for     herder camps and access to livelihood restoration
     the project area had been acquired from 150 affected         projects see next section we will continue to monitor
     households these plots comprised approximately              impacts on livelihoods to ensure further mitigation steps

are offset no net loss is deﬁned as the point at which projectrelated impacts on biodiversity are balanced by
measures taken to avoid and minimise the projects impacts to undertake onsite restoration and ﬁnally to offset
