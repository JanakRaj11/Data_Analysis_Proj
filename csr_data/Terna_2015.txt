    letter to our stakeholders




    the 2014 sustainability report the tenth published by terna further consolidates a longstanding trend of positive results
    but this is also the first report that we present as the new top management after taking office one year ago we are
    therefore particularly proud to present continued growth in the companys results but also the virtuous change necessary
    to design a terna of the future in a rapidly developing environment at both european and global level

    over the past months we have improved our understanding of a strong company among the top european network
    operators that strives to achieve excellence in the sustainable development of infrastructures in innovation and in
    services for users with consequent benefits for the electricity system without overlooking attractive remuneration for
    shareholders

    these issues are brought to the attention of our stakeholders both through the sustainability report and the annual
    financial report which as of last year amounts to the integrated report for this reason the content of this letter is the
    same as in the annual report

    2014 represents a solid starting point both from an economic and financial point of view as well as from the equally
    important perspective of sustainability performance regarding the first point results reflect the positive contribution
    of both regulated and nonregulated activities compared to 2013 revenues increased by 53 almost reaching 2
    billion euro ebitda reached almost one and a half billion euro and net profit increased by 6 well above 500 million
    euro capex in line with the development plans stood at approximately 11 billion and during the year new strategic
    infrastructures have become operational such as the trinolacchiarella and foggiabenevento lines significant
    projects for the countrys safety and energy efficiency regarding technological innovation we carried on with our efforts
    to develop energy storage systems despite high investment levels the group generated 260 million in free cash flow
    and net debt has been kept below 7 billion euro confirming close attention to the management of the financial structure

    progress has also been considerable in terms of sustainability performance the per capita training hours have been
    increased to 43 involving 91 of employees the number of occupational injuries has decreased with the injury rate down
    to 127 on the environmental front containment programs have enabled us to reduce the impact of sf6 leakage  the
    groups main source of direct greenhouse gas emissions  down to 055 below our target of 060 grid development
    has continued to provide an indirect but significant contribution to the growth of electricity production from wind and solar
    systems that in 2014 reached 143 of total production research activities have been focused on the development of
    new sustainable technologies the commitment to continuous improvement of processes has focused on relations with
    the stakeholders the new map presented in this report and the indepth information contained in the relevant chapter
    mark the launch of a better organisation of involvement methods the decision to put together this report in line with
    the new grig4 guidelines marks another step forward in the field of sustainability following our traditionally attentive
    approach to transparent communication and quality reporting application of the new guidelines has also revamped the
    handling of procurement and the supply chain

                                                                                                      letter to our stakeholders 11




these results represent an important reference to explore and seize new opportunities that may arise as well as to face
the challenges posed by the general market conditions the evolution of the european electricity sector and the new
regulation expected in 2015 for this reason the new 20152019 strategic plan foresees specific management actions
focused on a further strengthening of the electricity system with a view to an increasingly interconnected european grid
on a more selective approach to investments with lower impacts on electricity tariffs and debt on the development of
nonregulated activities and finally on increased operating efficiency also thanks to the new organisational structure
and the launch of an important voluntary generational turnover programme concrete environmental and social initiatives
and those regarding relations with stakeholders will contribute to the sustainability of our actions also in keeping with
our adhesion to the united nations global compact in line with our commitments as a founding member of the global
compact network italy foundation

to sum up starting from the results achieved and from a track record of value creation we believe the group is well
positioned to positively face and overcome future challenges leveraging the competence willingness and strong values

14 2014 sustainability report



    10 years of sustainability

    with the publication of this report terna has reached its tenth year of reporting on its environmental and social
    performance in line with the commitments made in its code of ethics and which have been translated into concrete
    measurable and comparable objectives
    since the first edition in 2005 the sustainability report has been submitted to the board of directors for approval as
    of the second year it has adopted the gri g3 indicators and been submitted to an external auditing firm for review the
    same that audits the financial statements
    over the years the increase in the number of indicators has been connected to a growing capacity to define environmental
    and social objectives achieving these objectives has led to a significant increase in the number of socially responsible
    investors among ternas shareholders for floating shares going from 16 in march 2009 to 61 in december 20141
    as well as the inclusion of the terna stock in the main international sustainability indices

    network which after two years in line with the increase in the number of indicators published reached the advanced
    level the highest possible for the completeness and transparency of information
    in line with the sustainability information in compulsory corporate reporting published by the italian national board of

core business electricity transmission

ternas core business is the transmission of electricity in italy
the italian electric system consists of four stages producing transmitting distributing and selling electricity

terna is responsible for managing the electric system by
 operating the highvoltage grid
 maintaining infrastructure
 planning grid development
 constructing the grid

32 2014 sustainability report




                                                                         cabine primarie atmt   cabine secondarie mtbt   trasformatori




    the main stages of transmission are as follows


    operating the grid
    in operating the grid it is essential to ensure a balance between input and output at all times ie between the supply
    of energy produced domestically and imported and consumption by end users this function is termed dispatching and
    is managed by terna rete italia
    preparation for realtime operation includes planning unavailability of the grid and of production plants with different
    time horizons forecasting national electricity demand comparing demand for consistency with the production plan
    determined as the result of the free energy market electricity market and contracts outside of the electricity market
    acquiring resources for dispatching and checking the power transits for all the transmission grid lines
    during the realtime control stage the national control centre coordinating other centres around the country monitors
    the electric system and dispatches electricity intervening by communicating commands to producers and remotecontrol
    centres in order to vary grid supply and distribution to avoid the risk of grid degeneration and prolonged power outages
    it may also intervene in an emergency to reduce demand for further details please see pages 6467 service quality
    and continuity


    maintenance
    terna rete italia maintains power lines and substations through three area offices which are divided into eight
    operational transmission areas and which employ over 80 of the groups human resources for further details please
    see page 67 plant maintenance


    grid development planning
    analysing electricity flows in the grid and producing demand projections allow terna to identify the critical points of
    the grid and work to be carried out in order to ensure the systems adequacy in terms of meeting demand securing
    operations reducing congestion and improving service quality and continuity
    work to be carried out is detailed in the national transmission grid development plan which is presented every year to
    the ministry of economic development for approval terna then follows the authorisation process from prior consultation
    with local government through to construction authorisation
    finally by analysing the grid terna also sees to identifying the best ways of connecting to the transmission grid for all
    operators who wish to connect their plants for further details please see page 68 grid development

                                                                                                                           ternas profile 33



construction
terna rete italia sets the engineering standards for plants connected to the grid particularly construction standards and
the performance required of equipment machinery and station and powerline components as far as plant construction
is concerned terna prepares projects for the authorised works it sets out the requirements for external resources
and project budgets as well as the working methods and technical specifications for the components and materials that
will be used in constructing the new lines or stations including the adoption of innovative methods the construction of
new plants is normally outsourced for further details please see page 69 completed work



other activities

to complement its core business terna develops nonregulated activities or those subject to regulation by the
italian regulatory authority for electricity gas and water aeegsi but different from the licensed activities
in 2014 these activities concerned
 progress with investment projects in storage systems see the box below
 continuation of initiatives abroad



    the innovative energy intensive and power intensive projects
    the rise in generation from renewable sources  increased by the priority dispatch obligation  the global economic
    crisis and the consequent contraction of demand further complicated secure management of the grid and its
    power flows owing to its long and narrow shape italy was one of the first to have to tackle these problems but
    it is also among the first to find solutions positioning it at the leading edge of technological innovation in the field
    of storage systems as part of a complex strategy of updating the ntg to cope with these new challenges terna
    has launched two parallel projects in the area of storage systems
    the first project entitled energy intensive is aimed at reducing local congestion in the areas of southern
    italy where wind farms are concentrated along the apennines between campania and apulia in certain grid
    conditions in fact it is necessary to limit production from renewable sources with an economic loss the
    incentive is still paid and environmental damage the green energy not delivered is replaced by the same
    amount of nongreen energy which involves the entire electrical system to avoid such problems terna is
    constructing three storage plants using sodiumsulphur nas technology for approximately 12 mw of power
    each and a total capacity of approximately 250 mwh
    the second project entitled power intensive involves the creation of 40 mw of storage systems on the major
    islands with the objective of contributing to the defence of the electrical system increasing its ability to react rapidly to
    fluctuations caused by the unforeseeability of renewable sources given the great innovation typical of these systems
    terna in agreement with the med and the aeegsi has decided to proceed in two successive stages in the first 16
    mw are planned divided into two installations with power of approximately 8 mw each situated on the major islands
    when this stage is complete a further 24 mw will be installed in the most critical areas of the said islands the specific
    feature of the first stage also known as the storage lab is that multiple technological solutions will be installed
     zebra lithiumion batteries and in the near future lithium supercapacitors and flow batteries  and it thus becomes
    the largest laboratory in the world on electrochemical storage plants see also page 75


development abroad
terna has two strategic objectives abroad developing interconnections with neighbouring countries to increase the
security value and sustainability of supply and diversification with respect to national investments also through
cooperation with energy operators with a consolidated presence abroad italy is the most interconnected state in
europe with especially good links to mediterranean countries france 2013 saw the commencement of work on the new
transalpine interconnection slovenia greece and soon also malta 2015 and montenegro 2019 focusing international
development on the mediterranean basin allows terna to benefit from italys competitive advantage its geographical
positioning  not only a potential outlet market but a hub between continental europe and the mediterranean this also
has an impact on the security of the system following the integration of renewable sources in the grid and european
regulations to create a single market it is essential to create strong interconnections with foreign countries and therefore
natural outlet markets such as the balkans and north africa investment in other countries with positive growth trends and
which require electrical infrastructure along with a stable reliable legislativeregulatory framework increases the value of
ternas skills

34 2014 sustainability report



    the balkans
    the balkan peninsula is an area of strategic interest for terna considering its proximity and the energy potential in the
    region particularly with regard to renewable resources
    the new undersea power line between italy and montenegro incorporated into the ntg development plan will link italy
    to the balkans via 415 km of 500 kv cable between the hubs in villanova pescara italy and kotor montenegro with a
    transmission capacity of 1000 mw
    the construction of interconnection cables received the necessary authorisation the international tenders have been
    awarded in italy the work is managed by terna rete italia while in montenegro by terna crna gora doo in 2014 the
    necessary authorisations were received in montenegro for preliminary activities related to the cables and substation and
    the construction site was opened in lasta kotor


    north africa
    terna is not currently invested in north africa but is involved in preliminary development studies on
     the creation of an electrical corridor between the maghreb and europe involving the interconnection of the countries involved
      terna is currently exploring the possibility of a tunisian interconnection with the tso in tunisia steg
     participating in cooperation institutional and industrial initiatives to this end terna was one of the promoters of medtso


    cooperation between mediterranean tsos medtso
    medtso is the association of 20 transmission system operators from 18 countries around the mediterranean terna was
    the driving force behind setting it up in 2012 and hosts the organizations head offices
    together with its 20152017 action plan project mediterranean was launched by medtso in 2014 to promote
    infrastructure investments in the region it comprises five areas of activity and is cofinanced by the european commission
    following the signing of a cooperation agreement in december 2014
     rules mediterranean network code and technical rules for the international exchange of electricity in cooperation with
       medreg
     infrastructure coordinated planning of developments to the mediterranean grids
     international exchange of electricity promotion of international exchange of electricity
     medtso database sharing information between electricity businesses in the mediterranean
     knowledge network development of a network to exchange knowledge and experience in partnership with universities in
       the medtso countries
    during the euromediterranean conference of energy ministers in rome in november 2014 the ec medreg the
    association of mediterranean electricity and gas regulators based in rome in the offices of the aeegsi and medtso
    signed a partnership agreement recognising both associations as institutional partners in the euromediterranean energy
    sector




    sustainability aspects related to terna

    ternas main business is the provision of a service which is indispensable for the operation of the entire italian electric
    system and to ensure electricity for everyone the greatest social and economic impact of the companys business lies in
    its ability to provide the general public with a reliable efficient electric service commitment to service is therefore also our
    main reference point when approaching sustainability matters this has been confirmed by the results of the materiality
    analysis carried out in 2013 and reviewed in 2014 see the methodological note on page 140
    in general ternas intent as ratified in its code of ethics is to construct and develop relationships based on trust with
    stakeholders which are able to create value for the business and for the stakeholders themselves
    although the end users of the electric service are not direct customers of terna but rather are companies that distribute
    and sell electricity the essential role it performs in the electric system makes terna ethically responsible for the service
    with regard to italian society thus terna is fully aware of the responsibility entrusted to it by the government licence
    and sets itself the following objectives
     providing a secure reliable continuous and costeffective service
     developing and ensuring an efficient transmission system
     respecting impartiality and neutrality in order to ensure equal treatment for all grid users

                                                                                                                    ternas profile 35



in ternas view business and sustainability matters are closely linked so much so that both the company and its
stakeholders consider adopting a responsible approach to planning the ntg a company priority
this means being proactively concerned about the possible environmental and social impact of any development
adopting all the necessary measures to prevent and minimise such an impact and pursuing a constructive dialogue
with local communities who live in the area where the development is planned or where there are power lines
for terna respect for the environment and for local communities is a rule of conduct which can trigger a virtuous cycle
it allows biodiversity and the richness of the landscape and local culture to be preserved and facilitates acceptance and
creation of new infrastructure generating financial benefits for shareholders and for society which can enjoy a more
secure more efficient and less costly service focus on the community is also demonstrated by the creation of initiatives
of social humanitarian and cultural value which serve as a concrete sign of participation in the growth of civil society
the role of human resources in ternas work is crucial renewing specific technical skills which are often rare or
unique in the electricity industry constitutes an important part of ternas sustainability approach another which is just as
important is occupational safety this is especially relevant due to the fact that many operational tasks are associated
with particular risks such as work high above ground and maintenance work on live lines
further details on the key sustainability issues for terna can be found in the first section of the four chapters on service
economic environmental and social responsibility in this report




sustainability governance

code of ethics
the code of ethics approved by the board of directors on 21 december 2006 is the most authoritative reference for
identifying sustainability issues important to terna and for defining internal policies and guidelines it can be used as
a concrete guide in everyday decisions helping to achieve the objective of establishing and consolidating trust with
stakeholders one of the commitments expressed in the code is to provide evidence in the sustainability report each
year of the implementation of the companys environmental and social policy as well as the consistency between the
objectives and results achieved in february 2015 considering the changes made over time to the groups organizational
structure terna developed a guideline for the adoption of the code of ethics by the companies of the group which
contains interpretation instructions on the connection between the specific contents of the code and the operational
context of the parent company and its subsidiaries
the code of ethics is available in the investor relations section of ternas website under corporate governance


global compact
                                                                                                                                    g4hr4
when it joined the global compact  the united nations multistakeholder network  in 2009 terna further cemented its
commitment to observing the ten principles of the global compact on human rights employment the environment and                   g4hr5
preventing corruption these principles were already set out in ternas code of ethics as a benchmark for the companys
corporate responsibility and sustainability initiatives terna has been on the steering committee for the italian network           g4hr6
since 2011 and contributed to the work done in 2014 by taking part in the working group on integrated reporting for the
fourth year running terna also submitted a communication on progress cop at the global compact advanced level

    management policies and systems

    the conduct principles and criteria in the code of ethics have been translated into corporate policies and coherent
    management systems specifically these include


    internal organization
    with regard to sustainability the following are of particular significance
     the presence of a sustainability steering committee the members of which are the chairperson of terna spa  to
      whom the board of directors on 27 may 2014 gave in addition to institutional duties the role of promoting and
      advising on csr  the ceos of terna rete italia spa and terna plus srl and a number of directors who share the
      responsibility for determining strategic guidelines and sustainability objectives for the terna group and for monitoring
      their progress and implementation the groups csr manager is the secretary of the steering committee which
      also decides on the groups annual and longterm sustainability plans to support and add to the strategic plan it
      supervises company activities related to sustainability
     the presence of a corporate social responsibility unit within the external relations and communications department
      which in collaboration with all company departments and with reference to best practices helps define the companys
      sustainability objectives from an ethical social environmental and sustainabilitygovernance viewpoint and
      communicate the objectives and results of corporate social responsibility moreover the unit constantly monitors the
      risks connected with sustainability which entail potential negative repercussions for the companys reputation and its
      intangible value by analysing the ratings of the main agencies such as robecosam vigeo and eiris which regularly
      assess sustainability
     the sustainability team a permanent working group that guarantees application of the guidelines and achievement of
      the objectives defined by the sustainability steering committee and serves as the drive belt between the steering
      committee and the various company departments responsible for implementing its decisions
     the use of sdm sustainability data manager software to manage the sustainability it system which currently collects
      more than 1500 indicators corresponding to textual information data conversion factors and formulas for monitoring
      ternas environmental and social performance
     the presentation to the board of directors of sustainability objectives and results when it approves the sustainability
      report



    integrated management system accreditations and certifications
    work relating to the fields of the environment and occupational safety which are a crucial part of ternas sustainability
    vision are coordinated and directed in the integrated quality environment and occupational safety management system
    which is certified as iso 90012008 iso 140012004 and bs ohsas 180012007 compliant the integrated system
    covers 100 of ternas activities in italy and abroad both the work carried out on existing plants and the planning
    design and construction of new plants
    on 27 january 2014 new certificates were released relative to the quality environment and occupational health and
    safety management systems for the companies in the terna group extended also to the subsidiaries terna cma gora
    and terna storage in june the usual inspections were carried out to maintain the certification for quality environment
    and occupational health and safety for the companies in the terna group finally during the year certification for
    the information security management system isms was renewed in accordance with the isoiec 270012005
    international standard initially obtained in 2011 for the timm applications amended text on the monitoring of the
    wholesale electricity market
    in 2014 in line with that established in italian legislative decree 34499 the seveso directive a management system
    for the prevention of serious accidents was implemented for the subsidiary terna storage which operates on its own
    sites where electricity storage systems which fall under the auspices of the directive have been and will be installed
    in regard to accreditation certificates in february the multisite testing laboratory was accredited this is located in
    viverone biella civitavecchia rome and frattamaggiore naples for tests on the equipment used in liveline work
    in accordance with the isoiec 17025 standard in september 2014 further inspections were carried out by accredia
    which confirmed the positive results this has allowed the terna group to become both nationally and at the european
    level the reference point in the highvoltage energy sector as it is the only organization accredited to issue certification
    in regard to tests carried out on llw equipment
    during 2014 the procedure for accreditation of the calibration centre activities in florence turin and cagliari began
    in accordance with the isoiec 17025 standard which is necessary in order to carry out metrological tests on active
    electrical energy meters and on electricity measurement systems used to determine energy flows for tax purposes as
    foreseen by the customs agency

                                                                                                                     ternas profile 37



with the aim of receiving uni cei en iso 500012011 certification in 2014 the development of the energy consumed
for own use management system for the terna group continued energy analyses were completed for the relevant
group locations and the first sensors were placed on the three sample electrical substations in rondissone turin dugale
verona and rome north for remote measurement of energy consumption


balanced scorecard
company activities are monitored and controlled with a balanced scorecard bsc system a control panel of indicators
used to evaluate at quarterly intervals the progress made in achieving the objectives including those related to
sustainability linked to the strategic plan



respecting the law and preventing corruption                                                                                         g4so3


for terna the prevention of corruption is a strategic activity which is intrinsically linked to internal audit systems legality
and honesty are two of the general principles on which the code of ethics and the conduct of the companys business
are based
ternas strategy in this regard focuses on three major areas organizational model 231 fraud management and staff
training
in the period 20122014 the audit unit examined all company departments 100 and subsidiaries several times in
relation to various types of risk including those relating to corruption within the scope of audit and risk assessment
activities for company procedures and departments
during 2014 the audit unit carried out an internal survey on respect for the ten principles of the global compact by
group companies which involved a total of 604 people for more details please see the box on page 52
since 2013 the safeguards and systems in place at the company have enabled attribution to the parent company of the
legality rating with the maximum score
this rating attributed to terna by the italian antitrust authority agcm is taken into consideration when granting loans
to businesses by public administrations and on accessing bank loans


organizational model 231

         the strategic plan

         on the 26 march 2015 terna approved its strategic plan for 20152019 the terna group intends to implement strategies
         aimed at generating cash flow which is able to ensure a sound and balanced financial structure as well as supporting the
         distribution of dividends the strategic initiatives identified will be concerned with
          the establishment of efficiency programmes concerning investments and operating costs
          the consolidation of transmission investments
          the creation of new crossborder interconnections
          the development of nonregulated activities

         regulated activities
         in the next five years the terna group plans for electricity grid development totalling around 39 billion euro 32 billion euro
         of which will be for investments in the national electricity grid
         the european and italian regulatory framework is increasingly aimed towards progressive growth and greater investment
         selectivity which favour energy infrastructure that is more technological smart and which has a low environmental impact with
         a particular focus on new electrical interconnections with neighbouring countries the works on the interconnections between
         foreign countries  piossascograndile between italy and france and villanovativat between italy and montenegro  will
         continue in this direction other grid development opportunities that are not included in the strategic plan can be added to
         these projects in fact the potential acquisition of a highvoltage grid owned by the fs is currently being evaluated

         nonregulated activities
         the groups nonregulated activities are predominantly divided into the following areas
          services for third parties
          tamini group
          interconnector
         the revenue from nonregulated activities are expected to grow by 16 on average on an annual basis surpassing 300
         million euro in 2019 and totalling around 14 billion euro during the course of the plan while maintaining a limited use of
         capital and an acceptable risk profile

         operating efficiency
         the efficiency programme will produce steady benefits of around 30 million euro in lower operating costs and will lead
         to a generational turnover plan that is able to place up to 200 new young professionals within the terna group over the
         next two years

         free cash flow improvement
         the evolution of ternas revenue composition deriving from regulated and nonregulated activities combined with
         measures implemented in the field in order to additionally increase operating efficiency will allow for significant benefits to
         be produced on the groups ebitda which will contribute robustly to the generation of a further 2 billion euro of free cash
         flow during the plan period these measures together with careful supervision of investments will contribute to a gradual
         reduction in net debt starting from 2018 and will guarantee the flexibility required to support an attractive dividends policy

         dividends policy
         for 2015 a dividend of 20 euro cents per share is provided for payout ratio of around 70 which also represents a
         solid base for the future

                                                                                                                    ternas profile 39

    relations with stakeholders

    building a relationship based on mutual trust with our stakeholders begins with taking their interests into account and analysing
    their compatibility with those of the company in order to be able to adopt a consistent and transparent approach
    the stakeholder map of the terna group was reviewed in 2014 updating the 2006 version used as a premise to the drafting
    of the code of ethics the review process which ended at the start of 2015 involved numerous unit managers directors
    and executives of the group companies with the aim of defining a model for managing relationships with stakeholders
    the method used to support the definition of the model is the one defined by the aa1000 stakeholder engagement standard
    ses developed by accountability last updated in the 2011 issue the eight categories of the previous map divided into
    48 subcategories were rearranged to provide more evidence to stakeholders previously merged with others the current map
    is divided into 12 categories and 73 subcategories for every category of stakeholder the following table shows the most
    important commitments expressed in the code of ethics and the specific engagement tools such as monitoring and checking
    expectations and opinions the various monitoring tools are used to different extents

    the gaudì portal
    the gaudì portal is the system that supports the integrated management of relevant and nonrelevant plant and production
    units it entered into service in its first version in january 2011
    the system which was established by specific provisions by the aeegsi allows registration and technical data for
    all plants and electricity production units completed or under construction across the country to be received and
    stored it facilitates management throughout the lifecycle of the plant by recording upgrades structural modifications
    commercial and technical variations and decommissioning total or partial of plants
    there are over 660000 plants registered in the system in total
    during 2014 two new modules were developed on the gaudì platform
     the gedi module to accommodate adjustments to distributed generation plants in line with the requirements of annexes
       a70 and a72 of the grid code this information is essential for ternas adoption of measures for reducing distributed
       generation in a state of emergency for the national electric system
     the sspc module for management and monitoring of the process of qualification of simple production and consumption
       systems has been in force since january 2015 the simple production and consumption services sspc are
       autoprocurement systems where one or more plants of the same company group fuel one or more consumption

    terna and greenpeace talk about the energy context to 2030
    three years on from the battle of the grids technical seminar on the development of the electricity grid
    growth of renewable sources and european 202020 energy objectives terna again welcomed greenpeace
    the environmental association dedicated to these issues for a panel discussion of possible energy scenarios
    in 2030 the starting point for the debate was the report power 2030 a european grid for ¾ renewable
    energy by 2030 the third produced by greenpeace on this subject focused on the feasibility of a european
    energy system with about 70 of energy production covered by renewable sources by 2030 the panel
    discussion which was attended by representatives of institutions industrial and consumer associations was
    opened by terna chair catia bastioli and greenpeace italia executive director giuseppe onufrio sven teske
    of greenpeace international presented the contents of the report which was then discussed with contributions
    from guido bortoni aeegsi chairman giulio volpi of the european commission directorategeneral for
    energy and owen wilson chair of eurelectrics environment and sustainable development policy committee
    the italian electricity grid development plan was presented by gianni armani chief executive officer of terna
    rete italia while the final observations were made by ternas chief executive officer matteo del fante the
    speakers found a point of agreement on the fact that in a production model still based on traditional energy
    sources the growth of renewables is now unstoppable and that they must be considered an opportunity to
    improve the grid and its management and thus reduce system costs



suppliers

the usual point of contact for terna and its suppliers is the procurement portal the section of the institutional website
where it is possible to learn about tenders participate in online tenders and go through the qualification process for
inclusion on the supplier register
in 2014 terna adopted the electronic platform for managing contract tenders thus making way for the dematerialization
of the procedure the procurement and contracts department also maintains direct contact with suppliers to manage
contractual relations and improve the companys knowledge of specific issues with groups of suppliers to that end
meetings are periodically organized with specialist companies or industrial associations to inform them about any updates
to the requirements or points of attention related to the ethical conduct to be followed in relations with terna
terna presents and discusses its main investment projects and relative procurement plans with the electromechanical
companies in the energy industry mostly members of confindustria anie and organizes meetings on specific issues
with particular reference to safety the important action programme requires an even greater effort on the part of suppliers
who are required to act not merely as simple contractors but as real technological partners terna plays an active role in
key meetings with suppliers such as industry meetings expositions and conferences in order to expand its portfolio of
suppliers terna continuously engages in procurement marketing by market scouting benchmarking and monitoring
the performance of suppliers this involves constant meetings with both italian and overseas supplier firms

g4so1   local communities

         ternas approach to local areas which is especially important when new lines must be constructed consists in a voluntary
         process of prior engagement with local institutions regional and local administrations park authorities etc this process
         involves the sharing of ntg development needs with local institutions a willingness to listen to stakeholder opinions
         and the search for a shared solution regarding the positioning of new infrastructure and the reorganization of existing
         structures
         to facilitate acceptance of electricity infrastructure by local communities terna considers it fundamental to hold
         discussions with local administrations as early as possible right from the moment when the need for a new ntg
         development project is recognised in this way the conditions are created in which to develop and build the grid
         together thus making it more sustainable and acceptable
         ternas approach to local areas envisages a voluntary preauthorisation procedure illustrated in detail in the section on
         consultation on pages 6869
         in regard to possible developments in this approach  above all in terms of direct contact with local communities  please

               iiasa which monitors and assesses the approaches tested
               acceptance by local communities and obtaining the necessary authorisation are at the centre of four pilot
               projects two in germany one in the united kingdom and one in belgium aimed at identifying new approaches
               to developing electricity grids in the context of these four pilot projects terna has selected certain initiatives
               and examined their efficacy applicability and transferability to the italian and international contexts through
               three workshops in february 2015 with ministries local organizations environmental groups and citizen
               representatives with the support of wwf research and projects
               the initiatives explored in the workshop were
                infomarket carried out by tennet a new approach to the local community that foresees meetings with
                  citizens in public places with explanations of the specific project with the help of maps round table discussions
                  divided into topics and the gathering of observations and comments
                electromagnetic field measurement carried out by 50hertz mobile office with technicians communication
                  experts and representatives of the academic world who can explain electromagnetism to citizens while also
                  measuring electromagnetic fields near electrical lines
                50hertz and nabu german partner of birdlife international collaboration with the goal of conserving natural
                  environments and animal species affected by the power line chosen for the pilot

               these initiatives which for terna represent potential areas for innovation in the consulting process for works
               in the development plan were well received by those participating in the seminars which welcomed ternas
               opening up to dialogue with citizens the first step was taken through the implementation of an infomarket in
               pescara see the box terna meets pescara on the next page



         in february 2014 terna signed an agreement with anci the national association of italian municipalities of which
         7318 municipalities representing 90 of the population are members to share the decision as to the location of electricity
         works throughout italy through increased harmonization between ternas development work and the municipalities town
         and local planning instruments

    terna meets pescara
    public information meeting in the municipality where the landing site of the italymontenegro undersea cable is
    situated

    on 6 february 2015 in the teatro dannunzio in pescara terna organized an information day on the
    italymontenegro undersea connection project the event directed at local citizens was open to all interested
    stakeholders it sought to give direct access to information for the citizens of pescara the area where vallelunga
    the landing site of the undersea cable on the italian coast is located this was a voluntary terna initiative
    consistent with the transparent and participatory approach that characterises development investment in the
    electricity grid the event was announced at a press conference then advertised by local media
    those who came to the event were welcomed and then accompanied in groups into a hall where ten information
    panels and four indepth topic tables had seen set up dealing with

           the reasons behind the work
           the consultation and authorisation process
           the project itself
           integration of the work and the local area

    at each table at least two terna technicians were present and answered questions from citizens they belonged
    to the departments responsible for engineering design and management of the worksite grid development
    planning the authorisation process and terna rete italia centresouth division the issues of greatest concern
    were the reasons behind the work the effective need for the same the anticipated benefits  especially for the
    local area  and the exact plan in relation to inhabited areas and electromagnetic fields
    in addition to the direct dialogue made possible by the meeting citizens were able to fill in a card to submit
    personalised information requests which terna undertook to answer by email
    ternas technicians were available to the public all day from 10 am to 7 pm about 300 people took part
    throughout the day ten cards with specific questions for terna were collected




opposition to the building of new lines
terna considers respect for the environment and for the territory an integral part of grid planning and makes every effort to
act in agreement with the local institutions however new infrastructurecreation projects often provoke adverse reactions
attributable to the nimby not in my backyard syndrome in these cases terna is willing to examine the situation and
find alternative solutions including ones which are technically more complex than those originally identified provided that
they are compatible with the general interest of the electric service in terms of security efficiency and costeffectiveness
searching for agreed solutions requires difficult discussions and can be a drawnout process the results are normally
positive but local opposition may persist throughout please note the following cases from 2014
 sorgente  rizziconi in 2011 when the construction sites opened protests broke out in the messina area against the
   new power line under construction despite the fact that the route was the result of more than two years of technical and
   environmental studies and despite consultation with local communities having begun in 2004 with over 100 meetings
   in february 2015 the prosecutors office of messina sequestered pylon no 40 in the municipality of saponara for
   presumed violation of the regional landscape protection plan which was approved after landscape authorisation for
   the pylon the work continues without issue along the rest of the route
 rationalisation in the middle piave valley the project was authorised in february 2011 and is now in the
   environmentalimpact assessment phase some municipalities including belluno and soverzene are opposed to
   the route proposed terna has informally put forward an alternative to the local authorities which is currently under
   consideration
 villanovagissi the project was authorised in 2014 the opening of the worksites was marked by protests which
   intensified when the land designated for the power line was taken over
 rationalisation of lucca the operation was authorised in march 2014 when the land parcels affected by the
   easement were published in the press a local protest immediately grew some municipalities including lucca had
   originally participated in the consultation but when faced with the protests decided to withdraw their support for the
   project

environmental litigation
environmental litigation originates from the installation and operation of electricity plants and primarily involves damages
which could derive from exposure to electrical and magnetic fields generated by power lines the parent company and
the subsidiary terna rete italia srl are involved in various civil and administrative lawsuits requesting the transfer or
change of the method of operation of allegedly harmful power lines despite their being installed in full compliance with
the applicable legislation italian law no 36 of 22 february 2001 and the prime ministers decree of 8 july 2003 only a
very small number of cases include claims for damages for harm to health caused by electromagnetic fields
only in a few sporadic cases have adverse judgements been issued against the company these have been appealed
and the appeals are still pending although adverse rulings are considered unlikely


litigation concerning licensed activities
given that it has been the licensee for transmission and dispatching activities since 1 november 2005 the parent
company is involved in a number of cases appealing aeegsi med andor terna measures relating to activities operated
under the license only in those cases in which the plaintiffs not only claim defects in the contested measures but also
allege that terna violated the rules established by such authorities has the company appeared in court within the scope
of this litigation although a number of cases have seen the aeegsi resolutions struck down in the first andor second
level court together with the consequent measures adopted by terna it is felt that there is little risk of adverse outcomes
for terna since the matters generally regard passthrough items this position is supported by the information provided
by the external legal counsel representing the company in the cases involved as the licensee for transmission and
dispatching activities the measures taken by the parent company terna when applying the resolutions adopted by the
authority are sometimes the subject of challenges in appropriate circumstances the economic costs of such challenges
may be borne by the authority


other litigation
also pending against terna spa are a number of disputes over town planning and environmental issues connected
to the construction and operation of some transmission plants an unfavourable outcome may have effects on terna
rete italia spa although currently unforeseeable and therefore not included in the determination of the provisions
for disputes and other contingencies both as the terna spa assignee for construction and as the assignee for the
financial year particular reference is made to the possibility that charges may accrue to terna rete italia spa for the
modification of plants and their subsequent temporary unavailability an examination of the above disputes carried out
by terna spa and its appointed external legal counsel suggests that the chances of negative outcomes are remote


penalties

          regarding significant environmental issues
          any written communication from stakeholders can be presented to a group office or organizational unit with the aim of
          reporting that an activity carried out by terna is causing or has caused damage it is filed by the office and managed by
          the relevant operating unit
          complaints received are classified on the basis of the relevant environmental aspects  defined by the environmental
          analysis  using the following categories waste noise biodiversity landscape electrical and magnetic fields lighting
          vegetation control and other
          most reports are related to electrical lines with a request to check electromagnetic emissions noise produced during
          plant operation and cutting of vegetation located along the power line corridors
          terna responds as soon as possible and in any case within 30 days of receiving the request or within 60 days if the size
          and complexity of the request make it impossible to resolve within the first 30 days
          in this case terna informs the requesting party of the extension in a timely manner indicating the reasons behind it
          details of reports received and managed during the last threeyear period are published on page 156

responsibility for the electric service

62 2014 sustainability report



    our approach

    ternas core business is the provision of electricity transmission and dispatching services in italy these services are
    in the general interest of society and performed on the basis of a government concession which assigns terna the role
    of national electricity transmission system operator tso the service performed by terna is indispensable for the
    operation of the entire electric system and for ensuring electricity for everyone
    the role that terna plays within the electric system renders it ethically responsible for the service provided to the
    whole of italy this responsibility regards both everyday operation of the transmission grid and medium and longterm
    considerations
    the grid is ternas asset however it is also essential infrastructure for the italian nation its present management
    maintenance and development must ensure efficiency and security in the immediate future as well as for future generations
    our managerial objectives are therefore connected first and foremost to compliance with regulations and meeting
    the specific targets set by the industry regulatory authority the aeegsi  the regulatory authority for electricity gas
    and water targets of particular relevance include
     continuity of performance measurements ternas performance in this area in recent years has been in line with the
       targets set
     security and griddevelopment goals set out in the
         1 security plan for the electric system in order to plan the investments needed to improve elements which have
            an impact on the safety of the electric system
         2 development plan approved every year by the ministry for economic development which sets forth the construction
            of new electricity lines and stations necessary to ensure an efficient and costeffective system terna also selects
            development projects on the condition that the overall financial benefits to the electric system outweigh the costs
    terna as the operator of the electric system is also responsible for compiling italian national statistics for the electricity
    industry this entails knowledge of confidential sectoroperator data and especially those pertaining to electricity producers
    terna protects this confidential data using the best practices possible to avoid information in its possession being accessed
    or communicated to unauthorised third parties given the nature of the service terna is not affected by problems of product
    responsibility typical of producers of goods or services for end customers




    energy context

    demand for electrical energy in italy

    for the third consecutive year the demand for electrical energy in italy fell in 2014 the demand for electrical energy in
    italy was 309006 million kwh provisional data reporting a drop of 30 in comparison with 2013 which in turn ended
    with a decline equal to that of 2012 the electricity demand recorded this year displays the same level as that recorded
    at the beginning of 2000 when comparing 2014 results with same day and temperature results from the previous year
    the aforementioned decline is 21 calendar and temperature effects in this instance are cumulative in conjunction with an
    average temperature that was approximately half a degree lower in the summer months and more than two degrees higher in
    the winter months 2014 while having the same number of days as 2013 had two fewer working days

the security of the electric system

ensuring the security of the italian electric system which is interconnected with the european grid is a difficult task that
terna performs through a series of actions based on a scrupulous assessment of operational risks
the objective is to maintain the risk of service outage within preestablished limits and should this occur mitigate
the negative consequences as much as possible
for terna preventing and containing operational risk means monitoring and protecting the physical integrity of its plants
preparing defence plans to limit the impact of outages preventative planning of operations improving the capacity for
realtime control training its operators developing new methods in support of the process of planning and control
increasing the reliability of the supporting resources and coordinating the management of the system interconnected
with the tsos of neighbouring countries
the projects are set out in the security plan for the electric system prepared by terna and approved by the ministry
of economic development the plan which in 2014 reached its eleventh edition is compiled every year and undergoes
a fouryear planning period in the various editions of the plan the approach to the security of the electric system has
become increasingly detailed the current structure of the security plan provides for eight subject areas relating to the
activities of planning control regulation and protection restarting and monitoring of the electric system as well as an
area devoted to the safe and optimal management of renewable resources
in the context of the areas of intervention the 2014 security plan confirms the shorttomedium term initiatives already
identified in the previous edition which also include innovative projects in particular powerintensive electrochemical
storage systems for ultrarapid frequency regulation and equipment to compensate for reactive power aimed at securely
managing the system in particular on the larger islands in the expected operating scenarios characterised by increasing
production from nonprogrammable renewable sources
in this context and also in consideration of the limited growth of the load and the progressive disposal of obsolete
conventional thermal plants with the consequent decrease of the system regulating capacity the 2014 plan includes
studies to provide the main interconnection lines on the north italian border with appropriate phase shifter transformers
psts in fact these devices are particularly useful for the regulation and balancing of systems in critical situations in
particular under low load conditions or with excess production from nonprogrammable renewable sources
in 2014 the investments made relative to projects provided for in the security plan totalled 82 million euro
the eleventh edition of the security plan for 20142017 provides for investments of around 303 million euro



7     renewable production can be defined as total production from wind solar geothermoelectric biomass included in the table under thermal production
      and hydro power net of pumping plant production
8     a proportion of thermoelectric production amounting to approximately 16400 gwh was attributable to biomass a renewable source

           information security

           to support its business activities terna uses the best available technology which starts with a structured approach
           to containing the growing threats to the groups information assets intangible and tangible assets that is electricity
           operator corporate data andor information it infrastructure networks it systems automation and control systems
           etc for this reason some time ago it adopted a security governance model inspired by the main international standards
           and best practices
           this model is now well established based on a detailed regulatory framework of policies and procedures combined
           with an operating programme coordinated by information risk management with a focus on all the various risk factors
           organizational technical and technological physicalenvironmental cyber etc including compliance with laws related
           to data processing and the fight against digital crime
           in 2014 this programme continued to favour a preventive approach with the adoption of preventive controls aimed at
           guaranteeing the necessary characteristics in terms of the security and resilience of ict assets by design prioritising
           the most critical or even vital ones for the proper functioning of critical infrastructure such as the grids the electricity grid
           control systems and the national electric system
           in the same programme the logical security of the numerous databases which store businesssensitive corporate
           information were an area of particular focus as well as the data related to users of the transmission and dispatching
           services electricity producers and traders for example production capacity and injection programmes and the data
           gathered for sector statistics or made available by the sector authority for monitoring the electricity market
           following the publication of the italian plan for digital security in 2014 httpwwwsicurezzanazionalegovitsisrnsf
           wpcontentuploads201402italiannationalstrategicframeworkforcyberspacesecuritypdf terna has promoted
           various initiatives to address the growing context of cyber threats that come from new technology more promptly and in
           partnership with other institutions
           new bilateral agreements have been signed with institutional bodies eg medcert which have assumed responsibility
           under the plan for cyberintelligence activities and national computer emergency response team cert activities in
           particular and relaunched at the operational level agreements that have already been signed such as cnaipic the police
           authority against computer crimes the aim is to create a privileged publicprivate rapport with effective relationships
           and secure data exchange which will allow for emerging cyber risks to be identified in time with special attention given
           to protecting critical infrastructure such as the electricity grid this will allow terna to gradually extend and strengthen
           its ability to act in the medium term in terms of prevention but also in the case of reacting to cyber incidents within a
           framework of mutual assistance at the national level
           in regard to protection of personal data terna guarantees the necessary monitoring of compliance with the legislative
           framework and again in 2014 as in previous years there were no complaints received from users for violation of privacy
g4pr8     or of inappropriate or unauthorised use of personal data entrusted to the groups companies either through the email

           continuity is the most important measure of the performance of the electric service
           each stage of the electric system  generation transmission and distribution  contributes to the final result ensuring the
           availability of electricity for society with outages that remain below preset thresholds and with appropriate standards of
           technical quality
           terna monitors the quality of the service provided using different indexes and identifies targets for improvement
           the indexes shown below where not otherwise specified are defined by the aeegsi resolution 25004 and by the
           terna grid code
           the change in the indexes does not reveal significant trends each index moves within a very small range in ratio to the
           overall service measured in addition among the causes of change are both external factors such as weather conditions
           and events for example faults attributable to management of the ntg analysis of the latter does not show systematic

    system continuity indicator

    average interruption time ait
    this is an internal indicator which measures the average interruption time of the electric system ntg in a year calculated as the ratio between the energy
    not supplied in a certain period ens value and the average power consumed by the ntg in the period considered the figure is rounded to two decimal
    places
    the lower the level of the indicator the better the service performance
    the performance achieved during the year with reference to the terna ntg11 is shown in the graph below that displays the trend of the index from 2002 to
    201312 net of the amount attributable to relevant incidents

    service continuity indicators
    service continuity indicators measure the energy not supplied to users of the grid following certain events according to criteria defined and calculated by
    the aeegsi the lower the indicator the better the service performance
    the final evaluation of the following continuity indicators for 2014 by the aeegsi was not available at the time this report was published however the
    provisional data illustrate a better performance with respect to targets and the final figures from the previous year therefore the following shows the
    changes in these indicators since they were introduced up until 2013

plant maintenance

plant maintenance is essential for ensuring service quality and continuity to ensure that plants can be identified
immediately and reached as quickly as possible especially in the event of malfunctions all workers use a handheld
device that incorporates a navigation system showing all plants
this was the main action taken in 2014 with regard to electrical substations and lines
plant monitoring and inspection in addition to the checks prescribed by law the following checks were carried out
 22700 periodical technical and surveillance checks on substations at different voltage levels
 inspections with visual checks on around 91300 km of threephase lines approximately 22200 km of which were
   carried out by helicopter visual  infrared with a total average frequency of around 15 inspections per year for each
   power line
 13800 instrumental checks using thermal imaging cameras to identify hot spots and daycor uv cameras to pinpoint
   the corona effect on insulators and conductors also climbing pylons with llw liveline working techniques
 power line inspections by helicopter after concluding the lidar laser imaging detection and ranging project
   achieving the aim of creating a georeferential platform of the national transmission grid terna started largescale
   experimentation of helicopter inspections with its own personnel to monitor the appearance and functioning of the
   highvoltage overhead lines this improves diagnostics and makes checks objective given that the results of the
   instrument surveys are recorded in line with the best practices of the leading european transmission system operators
ordinary maintenance terna identifies the action to be taken on the basis of indications of deterioration coming from the
integrated remotemanagement system the online sensors and the results obtained from the plant monitoring process
using maintenance and business intelligence mbi the expert system which optimises maintenance activities active
since 2005

g4en12   controlling vegetation for correct operation of the lines continual monitoring of vegetation growth is necessary to
          prevent it getting too close to the energy conductors and causing possible short circuits and line interruption in 2014
          vegetation was cut along 14500 km of power lines
          liveline working llw approximately 1600 monitoring inspections and 753 maintenance jobs were performed on live
          wires
          this work is performed with the line in operation and increases the availability of facilities contributing to improving
          service quality and continuity
          special maintenance in 2014 terna reconstructed 22 km of overhead lines and 18 km of underground cables and
          replaced approximately 2500 km of energy and guard wires




          grid development

          the transmission grid must gradually evolve and expand in accordance with developments in the generation and
          consumption of electricity both the supply and demand of electricity grow at uneven rates in different areas of italy
          the combination of these elements changes the flows of electricity in the system causing congestion in the existing grid
          to tackle these issues terna prepares annual grid development investment programmes so as to stay up to date
          with the evolution of production capacity and consumption and to increase its efficiency and security the development
          work that terna plans and carries out also has positive repercussions on society in fact the assumption underlying its
          implementation is that the collective financial benefit generated outweighs its cost
          every year terna prepares a transmission grid development plan dp with the national transmission grid
          development projects envisaged for the next ten years and the progress made on development works planned in
          previous years the 2015 development plan is concerned with the transmission grid development investments for
          20152024
          the document accompanied by a closer examination of the economic sustainability analyses for the main development
          plans describes the reference framework the objectives and criteria for transmission grid planning the new development
          needs identified in 2014 priorities for action and the expected results of the development plan
          every development plan follows a detailed path it is assessed and approved by the ministry of economic development
          and subject to public consultation pursuant to article 3613 of italian legislative decree 9311 by the authority for
          electricity gas and water and also subject to evaluation by the grid user consultation committee
          in addition pursuant to italian legislative decree 15206 as amended the dp is also subject to the strategic environmental
          assessment sea15 process carried out by the ministry for environment and protection of land and sea in collaboration
          with the ministry for cultural heritage




g4so1    a responsible approach to grid development the consultation
g4ec7
          since 2002 terna has used a new framework for creating infrastructure in italy by choosing to voluntarily bring
g4en27   discussions with local communities forward to the project planning stage for power lines and electrical substations
          within its development plan this improves the quality of relations with public authorities at various levels compared with
          previous interaction when the company merely complied with legal requirements which stipulated that discussions with
          local communities need only begin when the planning of the infrastructure was already welldefined often leading to
          strong opposition from local institutions and residents on the contrary ternas approach involves regional authorities
          sharing grid development needs and working alongside terna to find sustainable solutions which accommodate those
          needs
          the aim of this method is the optimal localisation of new installations terna and the public authorities find shared
          solutions in terms of local corridors based on area criteria known as erpa criteria and ratified in specific agreements
          thus terna has initiated a voluntary approach which integrates environmental and local considerations into the planning
          process through constant discussion with local stakeholders preceding integration which would subsequently be

the sea at the time the subject of an ec directive 200142ec was to be transposed into italian law only many years
later in 2007 with italian legislative decree 1522006 and with much less detailed implications at the level of relations
with local institutions from 2002 terna has signed protocols of understanding and planning agreements in 18 regions
and in the autonomous province of trento in order to formalise reciprocal commitments as part of a transparent inclusive
planning process

area criteria
during consultation with local institutions agreeing on location criteria is one of the most effective instruments for
selecting solutions with the least impact in terms of local corridors these criteria are used to identify the greater or lesser
degree of suitability of an area to host electrical infrastructure
as part of the national sea committee terna and regional administrations agreed on a system of criteria erpa based
on four classes
 exclusion areas in which all construction is excluded currently the exclusion criterion includes areas recognised by
   law as areas of absolute exclusion such as airports and military zones and areas which are not directly excluded by
   law but which are constrained by a priori agreements between terna and the entities involved
 repulsion areas that can be considered only in the absence of more environmentally compatible alternatives
 problematic areas in which passing is problematic for an objective reason associated with specific features of the area
   and documented by the authorities involved which therefore require further analysis
 attraction areas with good landscape compatibility and areas that already host line infrastructure such as energy
   corridors in which it would be more sustainable to position a new line with respect to new areas that do not have any
   line infrastructure
the support of gis geographic information system technology is fundamental when searching for sustainable locations
corridors for ntg development projects this technology allows comprehensive consideration of all information relating
to the different types of land use and protection obligations territorial naturalistic cultural landscape etc in order to
identify possible locations which are the most compatible with the area concerned further reinforcing this approach
in february 2014 terna signed an agreement with anci the national association of italian municipalities see page 54




main development work in progress

each year grid development work takes the shape of numerous projects at different stages of the implementation cycle


completed work
in 2014 terna increased its transformation capacity by about 2165 mva of power and put approximately 330 km
of new high and veryhighvoltage lines into operation among the works completed the projects of primary interest
include the new 380 kv double threephase trinolacchiarella power line the upgrade of the 380 kv foggiabenevento
connection the new 380 kv scillarizziconi power line the 220 kv underground power lines martinettolevanna
pellerina electrical substationpolitecnico electrical substation politecnico electrical substationtu centre
politecnico electrical substationtu south and pianezzapellerina to improve service safety in the metropolitan area
of turin with regard to power pants which feed in and use production from renewable sources in the south of italy
upgrades to extensive 150 kv portions of the grid have been completed lastly reactors were installed at the electrical
substations of udine west planais vignole piossasco teramo ospiate and cattolica eraclea


progress on construction sites
the major works that began in 2014 and which are still in progress aim to reduce grid congestion connect new power
plants particularly those based on renewable sources and make the national transmission grid more reliable with a
greater emphasis on the environment and safety among these are the 380 kv gissivilllanova power line the first of the
sections needed to double the adriatic backbone to 380 kv and the 380 kv sorgenterizziconi power line furthermore
as part of the wider udine westredipuglia planned project work at the udine south electrical substation continue
lastly important interconnection initiatives with foreign countries are under way in particular the italymontenegro hvdc
interconnection

    projects set out for use of energy produced from renewable sources

    implementing directive 200928ec and the national action plan nap prepared by the ministry of economic development
    terna included a specific section in the national development plan which defines the action needed for full use of the
    energy deriving from the production of renewable source systems
    the grid analyses carried out in order to facilitate the use and development of production from renewable sources have
    enabled us to identify action to be taken both on the primary 380220 kv transmission grid and on the 150132 kv
    highvoltage grid
    the figure below shows an overview of the main development work carried out on the 380 kv veryhighvoltage grid

connecting new plants

terna pursuant to italian legislative decree no 79 of 16 march 199917 must connect to the grid all those who request
the same specifically terna is responsible for connection to the national transmission grid ntg at highveryhigh
voltage for plants with a power of 10 mw or more while the assigned regional distribution companies are responsible for
connections to plants with power of less than 10 mw the methods and technicaleconomic conditions used by terna
to issue estimates to those who request a connection to the ntg are established in the grid code and the provisions
issued on the subject by the italian regulatory authority for electricity gas and water aeegsi the ntg connection
procedure begins with the presentation of a connection request to terna and concludes when the power plant enters
into service there are four key stages a preliminary stage concerned with developing the connection plans a planning
stage during which a project of works on the ntg is drafted and submitted to terna for approval an authorisation stage
in which the project is submitted to the relevant authority and an execution stage preceded by contractual arrangements
between terna and the proponent regarding the construction of ntg facilities although in recent years there has been
a steady decline in the number of connection requests owing mainly to changes in the incentive scheme which favours
the connection of small renewable energy plants and therefore typically to the distribution grid as well as the expiration
of some initiatives due to the noncompliance of proponents with regulatory requirements it should be noted that
 the trend in connection requests has been almost constant over the last few years
 in the context of the connection process there has been a significant upward trend in initiatives in the execution phase
   particularly for contractor plants in incentives tenders this latter trend is due to certain proponents having obtained
   authorisation for infrastructure aimed at collecting renewable energy through works connected to generation plants
   including the plants in basilicata such as the 380150 kv substation in melfi and the 380150 kv genzano  oppido 
   vaglio  avigliano backbone
17 specifically the legislative decree states the operator must connect to the national transmission grid all those who request the same without
   compromising service continuity and provided that the technical rules pursuant to paragraph 6 of this article are respected as well as the technical and
   economic conditions for access and interconnection established by the italian regulatory authority for electricity and gas now the italian regulatory
   authority for electricity gas and water a refusal of access to the grid must be appropriately justified by the operator

72 2014 sustainability report



     six generation plants began operating on the ntg during the course of 2014 for total power of around 113 mw
       contained with respect to previous years as a reaction to new mechanisms used to distribute incentives
    in terms of solar plants as already noted an increase was seen in requests made to the local distributor grid for mv and lv
    nonetheless as the distribution grids are interconnected with the transmission system the presence of these plants also
    has an effect on extensive portions of the high and veryhigh voltage transmission grid in these situations energy returns
    from the distribution grid to the transmission system in fact the plants referenced above are often concentrated in areas
    with low demand which leads to the energy produced returning to the hv grids in certain periods
    also note that in 2014 five new plants owned by distribution companies which are connected to the ntg began operating
    these plants are examples of infrastructure works included in an action programme involving several bodies which aims
    to bring forward connection requests from power plants run on renewable energy sources and more generally to ensure
    wellmanaged sustainable development of renewable energy across the country
    it has been confirmed that in 2014 there were more requests for the connection of renewable energy plants in southern
    italy and the islands which are more favourable in terms of the availability of primary sources throughout the whole of
    italy a significant reduction in requests for connection of solar sources has continued to be seen
    in addition note that the regulatory changes in regard to the regulation and management of simple production and
    consumption services sspc has led to terna managing connect requests relative to these types of plants
    bearing in mind that the national electricity sector has been affected by the crisis and uncertainties in the italian economy
    with significant effects not only related to the decrease in the demand for electricity but also the reduction in available
    production capacity as a consequence of plans to decommission or preserve production units implemented by the main
    operators we note the following relative to generation from conventional sources
     there are a number of plants for which despite having obtained building permits over recent years and commissioning
       already having been scheduled the construction sites have not yet been opened on account of the current economic
       situation which has led to the sustainability of the planned works being reviewed
     the definitive suspension of the planned conversion of three thermoelectric plants
     the opening of the worksites for two new thermoelectric plants planned for 2015 unless further extensions are granted
       by the relevant public authorities
    the graph below summarises the connection requests for production plants currently managed by terna specifically

        tenyear european network development plan
        entsoe prepares the tenyear european network development plan tyndp starting from the national
        investment plans and taking into account eu guidelines on the transeuropean energy networks in addition the
        tyndp identifies the development needs for crossborder capacity and any possible obstacles such as those
        deriving from authorisation procedures
        the latest edition of the plan which is published every two years was released in december 2014 and is being
        considered by acer the new plan is made up of six regional investment plans the development plan for the
        european grid and the report on the forecast scenarios and adequacy of the european electric system in addition
        for the first time it features forecasts on the state of the grid in 2030 this looking ahead to 2030 represents an
        intermediate step in the development of the electricity highways for 2050 one of the objectives of the european
        commissions energy roadmap 2050 in order to complete decarbonisation of the european electric system by
        that year
        compared to the national development plans drawn up by the tsos the 2014 development plan for the european
        grid includes only projects with a significant crossborder impact around 130 in total amounting to an expected
        investment of around 150 billion euro between now and 2030 ten terna projects are included in this plan for a
        total estimated investment of approximately 59 billion euro




    technology and innovation

    when introducing new technological and plant solutions and new instruments and methods aimed at improving the
    reliability of power plants and in turn service quality terna mainly uses inhouse technicians who base their work
    on carefully monitoring and analysing the performance of plants and equipment the group also uses the specialised
    support of manufacturers collaboration with universities rse spa ricerca sistema energetico and cesi spa a
    specialised service company in which it has a 42698 shareholding
    in particular in 2014 the terna group incurred costs of 182 million euro in respect of the associate cesi spa of which
    163 million euro were capitalised
    research into innovations and new developments in engineering mainly relate to three areas


    optimisation of infrastructure and materials
    work continues on designing pylons with reduced visual impact and which are more easily integrated into the surrounding
    environment as well as on researching conductors able to boost the transmission capacity of existing overhead lines and
    on developing new technology for highvoltage cables the activities carried out in 2014 were as follows
     engineering new singlestem supports with a lattice pylon structure in 380 kv double threephase circuit construction
      and factory testing of five supports intended for the villanovagissi line
     research on hightemperature lowsag htls conductors capable of withstanding higher temperatures without
      suffering mechanical degradation during operating life
     start of collaboration with other utilities acea and enel distribuzione for a study which assesses the use of vegetable
      insulation fluids  highly biodegradable and with a high flash point  in transformers as an alternative to mineral
      insulating oils


    new equipment and plant configurations
    research is focused on developing and implementing compact rapidinstallation stations scri after a positive
    trial run with the 150 kv compact rapidinstallation station a similar project has been planned for a 380 kv station
    which manufacturers confirm is viable furthermore it was decided that constituent models developed for the 380 kv
    compact rapidinstallation station would be used in innovative systems solutions for the construction of parallel bar
    bays implementation is planned for 2015
    for the hv cable lines in the light of the trials conducted in the laboratory and in the field the prycamtm portable
    tool developed by prysmian electronics srl was validated for partial discharge measurement in tests performed after
    installation without any contact being made with the component being tested thus ensuring the utmost safety

                                                                                              responsibility for the electric service 75



plant safety and the environment
the main aim of research is to guarantee greater levels of safety at plants and in the surrounding area in the event of
external potentially dangerous events such as fires earthquakes and extreme environmental conditions in 2014 we note
the following
 substations  the completion in collaboration with roma tre university of a study on the seismic vulnerability of the
  plants an area in which terna has obtained a patent for the wipe  rope tri system the effectiveness tests performed
  in the laboratory demonstrated a 50 reduction in structural stresses in the current year the plan to install this
  technology in stations located in sites with a high seismic risk was launched and 90 completed and the assessment
  of implementation in sites with medium risk is in progress testing also began in the laboratory and in the field on
  innovative instrument transformers which are intrinsically safe both from an environmental perspective no oil or sf6
  and in terms of the physical safety of people and objects
 overhead lines  the launch of an installation campaign in northern italy of the antirotation device for overhead
  conductors able to counteract the formation and growth of sleeves of wet snow and the implementation of a software
  model that predicts the formation of sleeves of ice
finally worthy of note is the beginning of a collaboration with rse spa to increase awareness of the consequences
of extreme climate scenarios  in line with the studies done by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 
regarding grid infrastructure and transmission operations




planning and development of storage systems

terna also affirms its commitment to guaranteeing secure and economical grid management including by launching
an innovative storage system agenda the plan is divided into two macroprojects energy intensive and power
intensive which envisage the installation of various types of systems
the two macroprojects as well as being highly innovative are also unique in kind and purpose the development of the
projects is managed by terna storage srl
the energy intensive project was first introduced in the 2011 development plan and envisages the construction of
three electrochemical nastechnology storage systems in southern italy with a total capacity of 348 mw
 ginestra benevento 12 mw
 flumeri avellino 12 mw
 scampitella avellino 108 mw
these plants will allow the 150 kv backbones of the national electricity grid which are present in areas with a high
concentration of nonprogrammable renewable energy sources to be managed with greater security and flexibility
in the first part of 2014 the construction of the ginestra and flumeri plants commenced and by december the first plant
had been commissioned as well as the first 6 mw of the second
the scampitella plant was authorised by the ministry of economic development in march 2014 and construction work
subsequently began the commissioning of the remaining 6 mw of the flumeri plant is planned for 2015 as well as the
entire scampitella plant
pursuant to aeegsi resolution 662013 which acknowledges the energy intensive projects as forming part of the
remuneration category for investments testing the storage pilot projects on the national transmission grid these plants
will be subject in the next 12 years to monitoring of the main parameters and indicators in order to verify the use and
actual compliance with grid requirements
in regard to the power intensive project proposed in the 2012 security plan which foresees the creation of 40 mw
the two sites designated for the storage systems  ciminna in sicily and codrongianos in sardinia were confirmed
authorised and implemented in 2014
having procured lithium and zebrabased storage technologies an activity which began in 2013 a total of 12 storage
system were constructed 5 in sicily and 7 in sardinia with the installation of these systems accelerated testing in the
laboratories was also undertaken and the results are expected in the first quarter of 2015 in regard to the 12 systems
installed on the two sites eight began operations in 2014 for a total of 86 mw 32 mw in sicily and 54 mw in sardinia

    smart transmission solutions

    one of ternas main needs is to make the transmission grid dynamic ie capable of evolving rapidly and effectively in
    response to unpredictable and rapidly changing circumstances
    therefore terna has set out projects in the development plan which will guarantee security reliability and efficiency in the
    electric system under various operating conditions while maximising the timely and flexible use of existing infrastructure
    and thus facilitating integration of growing production from renewable sources including those not directly connected to
    the ntg
    among these projects we note
     installing electrical equipment phase shifting transformers  psts for controlling energy flows on the high and
       veryhighvoltage grid
     installing synchronous condensers to improve the stability and operating security of the system
     installing reactors and condensers for proper management of reactive power flows on the grid with consequent cost
       reduction for the dispatching market
     using systems that allow realtime monitoring of transport capacity on existing lines also as a function of actual
       environmental conditions dynamic rating in this regard the testing which is drawing to a close will make it possible
       to define types and standards of application of the method in order for it to be progressively implemented and diffused
       in particular on the critical central northnorth and central southsouth sections and on renewable collection lines
     testing of diffused storage systems to maximise the exploitation of power from renewable sources and to improve the
       regulation of the high and veryhighvoltage systems
     initiatives based on smart logic aimed at improving the forecasting and control of distributed generation
    these solutions generally have reduced environmental impact allowing the use of existing assets to be maximised
    and offer implementation times and costs which are typically lower than those necessary for the creation of new network
    infrastructures highvoltage lines and stations
    the following innovative solutions are also planned
     participation in the greenme project grid integration of renewable energy sources in the northmediterranean
       as part of the connecting europe facility cef programme relating to the development of systems to integrate
       distributed generation from the south of france to the regions of northern italy a funding request for this project
       was presented to the european commission in july 2014 by italian and french tsos and dsos distribution system
       operators the project has been added to the list of projects of common interest pci published by the european
       commission in october 2013 as one of the smart grid projects the project is conditional on receiving funding from
       the european commission it was also renominated in the updated list of pci projects presented in 2014
     improving grid identification and control with digital systems by exploiting the potential offered by digital equipment
       the aim is to provide measurements directly for the analysis and monitoring of service quality
     monitoring grids the growing impact of renewable sources on the distribution grids requires data collection and
       modelling which will enable a more detailed overview of the loadgeneration on distribution systems that operate with
       the transmission grid

                                                                                             responsibility for the electric service 77




best paths project launched
beyond stateoftheart technologies for repowering ac corridors  multiterminal hvdc systems

after over two years working alongside the european commission the best paths project is underway
this ambitious fouryear research and development project is focused on developing highcapacity flexible
paneuropean transport grids needed to satisfy europes longterm energy objectives and to fully incorporate
renewable energy
with a 63 million euro investment 50 cofinanced by the eu this is the largest energy research and development
project of the european unions seventh framework programme
in rome on 30 october 2014 terna as the chair of the consortium of 39 research and industry leaders utilities
and transmission system managers hosted the kickoff meeting for the entire project which saw the participation
of over 70 experts from all over europe representing the various aspects of work foreseen as well as the
commission officer responsible for funding
the general coordinator of best paths is the spanish tso red eléctrica corporaciòn the project is divided
into five research areas in terms of work in the field each of which has its own demo leader these areas are
interoperability between wind farms and conversion stations iberdrola spain interoperability between multi
vendor converters in direct current grids rte france innovative components and systems in direct current
terna repowering of overhead lines in alternating current 50 hertz germany and use of superconductor
cables nexans france
in addition to being one of the founders of the initiative terna is also the leader of the largest demo worth
23 million euro related to the development of technology components and systems in hvdc inspired by the
needs related to the future renewal of the sacoi connection between sardinia corsica and mainland italy
the developments in research related to the sacoi framework will also be useful for more general issues related
to hvdc systems ternas task with the assistance of the research organization rse is project management
and coordination with the other demos in addition terna will create the system architecture and coordinate
the development and subsequent tests in the field by the involved industries toshiba for multilevel hvdc vsc
converters nexans for extruded dielectric submarine and underground cables for dc applications and de angeli
for highperformance overhead dc conductors in addition terna and rse will also coordinate laboratory testing
to assess the reliability of innovative insulators for dc overhead lines and to improve the techniques used to locate
faults in the very long cables typical of hvdc connections
the overall objective of the project is to identify technological best paths to develop more robust and flexible
grids able to support greater quantities of renewable energy and bridge the gap between production often
located in remote areas and large consumption areas creating benefits for the integrated electricity market and
an ever more sustainable energy system
the partners represent all the links in the chain of european innovation from universities and research centres
that create new knowledge to the energy industry that develops new products through to the end users  the
transmission grid operators and utilities that use these products to offer a better service to all of society
for once through ternas project proposal italy will be able to play a primary role in the use of european
funds allocated to maintain or acquire technological leadership in the context of energy systems however the
overall benefits greatly exceed the purely economic advantages grants for 50 of research costs and 100 of
management costs given that they offer the possibility to focus sizeable research resources including private
ones on the most relevant aspects for concrete applications this is combined with direct access to the results
of the other demos the technological consequences sharing of best skills and practices opportunities for
professional development and not least greater synergy with the manufacturers who continue to serve as the
main source of technological innovation

    our approach

    at terna we believe that service objectives are to be integrated with financial performance objectives the synthesis
    of these two areas results from the search for operating efficiency and growth opportunities whilst fulfilling service
    obligations and in particular ensuring the security of the electric system
    in italy terna holds the monopoly on electricity transmission it cannot therefore increase business or revenue by enlarging
    its market share hence it pursues these objectives mainly by
     promptly delivering the investments set out in the grid development plan which both improve the electric service for
       society and constitute a source of corporate income
     seeking operational efficiency and optimal capital structure
     developing nonregulated activities connected to transmission
     seeking business opportunities in industries other than transmission
     expanding business abroad
    for a detailed presentation of the economic and financial results achieved by the group see the annual reports available
    online in the investor relations section and in particular the 2014 integrated report the main results of the last three
    years are however discussed in this chapter

value added18

valueadded is a measurement of the income of a company and that of a whole economy during a given period
usually one year in corporate accounting terms value added is calculated by subtracting costs incurred for procuring
intermediary goods and services necessary for production from the value of production itself revenue associated with
goods and services produced during the year these costs do not include labour costs which are instead part of the
value the company adds through its activities to intermediary goods and services the difference between sales revenue
from the final product and the cost of raw materials and support services is value added other than the cost of labour
value added also includes profits and the share of income allocated to paying interest on debts or taxes

      the amounts relative to the creation and distribution of the value added are taken from the consolidated financial statements which were

      return on capital for 2014 refers to the advance distributed in november 2014 1407 million euro and to the balance proposed to the meeting of
      the bod in the session on 26 march 2015 2613 million euro


the 20122014 period shows an increase equal to 30 of the value added generated by the group in the context of
which the impact of borrowed capital remained essentially stable averaging 14 in regard to staff remuneration the
impact on total net value added equal to 20 in 2012 and 2013 shows an increase of 39 attributable both to the
provision for early retirement incentives connected to the corporate reorganization programme begun by the parent
company in 2014 as well as the impact of the tamini group acquired in may 2014
with reference to direct and indirect taxes the tax incidence with respect to total net value added averaging 29 in
previous years fell by 66 with respect to the 2012 figure mainly due to effects connected to the robin hood tax
pursuant to res no 1382011 specifically the groups 2014 tax figures reflect the impact of the reduction applied to
the ires italian corporate income tax markup from 105 to 65 bringing the ires rate to 34 in contrast to 38
in 2013 as well as the adjustment of net deferred taxes at 31 december 2014 following the judgement which declared
its unconstitutionality19
with regard to the taxes paid by the foreign subsidiaries of the group in 2014 we note the following
 the montenegrin terna crna gora registered a loss which therefore did not generate any type of taxation to be paid to
   the montenegrin government for details please see page 25
 the united states based subsidiary of tamini group tamini trasformers usa llc paid 54812 dollars in federal
   taxes and 13032 dollars in state taxes
return on risk capital in relation to total net added value is substantially in line with 2012 09 while the effect of
provisions increased from around 4 to around 10

19 on 11 february 2015 the constitutional court published judgement 102015 with which it declared unconstitutional the robin hood tax given
   that in the judgement of the court applying this declaration of illegitimacy retroactively would constitute a grave violation to the equilibrium of the
   governments accounts sanctioned under article 81 of the constitution the unconstitutionality is effective as of the day following the publication of
   the sentence in question therefore terna group determined current taxes for financial year 2014 by applying the ires rate with a markup of 65
   and adjusted net deferred taxes to the rate foreseen at the time of the payment 275 without application of the additional robin hood tax this
   adjustment had a positive impact on the income statement of around  30 million

g4ec8   other economic effects

         ternas economic impact does not end with the production and distribution of value added first and foremost
         the economic repercussions of the electric service must be considered terna ensures that a service of general
         interest which contributes to the countrys economic growth is provided over time
         the companys grid development work is of particular importance developing interconnections with bordering
         countries makes it possible to import electricity at more competitive prices compared to domestic production as well
         as to have an additional power reserve and guarantee greater competition within the energy markets reducing grid
         congestion improves the use of generation resources in order to meet demand and makes it possible to use the most
         competitive plants with positive effects on competition within the generation sector and on end prices
         in accordance with the legal and regulatory framework all of ternas investments in grid development are examined
         from a technical and economic perspective by comparing the estimated cost of the work with the related benefits in
         terms of the reduction of the overall system expense in order to maximise the costbenefit ratio consequently every
         euro invested by terna on average generates multiple savings for the users of the grid which are ultimately passed on to
         the end consumer it is therefore significant that ternas investment most of which is to develop the grid has increased
         greatly over the last few years

         the indices reflected a slowerthanexpected economic recovery a deflation scenario and high unemployment levels
         these macro factors were combined with fears associated with the crisis in the ukraine political instability in greece and
         the falling price of oil
         as regards government securities the announcements of further expansionary monetary policy measures by the european
         central bank in a context of official interest rates close to zero permitted a significant reduction of government security
         yields in particular the yield of italian tenyear btps fell by more than 50 going down from 41 to 19 at the end

    revenue and risk management

    revenue structure and the regulatory framework

    in 2014 the terna groups revenue amounted to  1996420 million the majority of this revenue about 93 derives from
    traditional activities regulated by the authority for electricity gas and water hereinafter the authority and around 7
    refers to nonregulated activities the latter consist mainly of revenue from the tamini group and for specialised services
    provided by other companies in terna group to thirdparty entities such as maintenance activities on hv facilities plant
    engineering maintenance of the fibre optic network housing of telecoms equipment as well as other consulting activities
    in the transmission sector


    regulated revenue
    the companys regulated revenue is generated by tariffs  the most important of which is the transmission tariff ctr
     paid to terna by different categories of operators in the electricity industry distributors producers and dispatching
    users in proportion to specific physical quantities set as a reference by the aeegsi quantity of energy transported in the
    national transmission grid energy dispatched number of input points
    the aeegsi determines the unit sum of tariff components for the transmission and dispatching services annually on the
    basis of rules defined at the beginning of every fouryear regulatory period ternas recognised costs and the amounts
    set as a reference forecasts for the aforementioned physical quantities are contributing factors the cost components
    considered when determining the above tariffs can be related to three main categories
     rab remuneration the rab regulatory asset base is revalued annually on the basis of istat data regarding
      the change in the grossfixedinvestment deflator and is updated to account for net investments made by terna and
      decommissioning carried out during the year on the basis of resolution no 19911 the rab is remunerated by the
      authority at a base return rate wacc correlated with market rates for the 2012 and 2013 tariffs the wacc was 74
      for those of 2014 and 2015 it was updated by the authority to 63 all investments made after 31122011 benefit
      from an additional 1 paid by the authority in order to compensate for the regulatory lag ie the delay with which
      tariffs remunerate investments therefore the base rab remuneration for these investments as of the 2014 tariffs is
      73 631
     for some specific types of investments this return is increased for 12 years from the initial startup date while for
      some strategic investments the increase occurs during the construction phase on the condition that terna achieves
      certain efficacy benchmarks in 2014 rab remuneration base  incentive constituted approximately 51 of ternas
      recognised costs
     depreciation and amortisation recognised depreciation and amortisation are adjusted in accordance with the useful
      life of assets and of new investments which have come into operation they are also reevaluated annually according
      to changes in the grossfixedinvestment deflator the share of amortisationdepreciation remuneration represented
      approximately 31 of the total recognised costs in 2014
     operating costs these are typically the costs of labour and the procurement of goods and services which do not
      constitute investments the component covering these costs which in 2014 came to about 18 is based on annual
      operating costs valid for the entire regulatory period ie 2010 for the regulatory period 20122015 and on the residual
      portions  temporarily left to terna  of the extraefficiency achieved in the two preceding regulatory periods all of
      this is annually revised on the basis of inflation and adjusted by an efficiency factor aimed at fully transferring extra
      efficiency over time to end users
    once the unit amounts of the transmission and dispatch tariffs have been established recognised costs divided by
    the reference quantity the returns gained by terna depend on the actual trend of the physical quantities concerned
    and particularly on the energy transported by the ntg and the energy dispatched the sharp decline in consumption
    that began in the second half of 2008 together with the increase in energy input into the distribution networks due
    to incentives for the production of renewable energy have rendered the trend in energy transported by the ntg less
    predictable and led the authority to confirm for the iv regulatory period fouryear period 20122015 the mechanism to
    partially neutralise the volume effect introduced by resolution argelt 18808 this mechanism foresees that
     if the final energy total is less than that used to calculate the tariffs ternas remuneration is increased for the portion of
      volumes which exceed the 05 exemption
     if the final energy total is greater than that used to calculate the tariffs terna is required to return the excess earnings
      for the portion of volumes which exceed the 05 exemption


    20 this amount includes the values associated with terna crna gora and tamini group

                                                                                                                                 economic responsibility 87



passthrough items
in addition to regulatory revenues and those generated by nonregulated activities terna manages cost and revenue
items connected to transactions completed with electricity market operators to buy and sell the energy needed for
dispatching activities these are known as passthrough items meaning they do not have an influence on the net
income in the terna groups income statement revenues equal costs
these items include payments such as the capacity payment which terna collects from withdrawal dispatching users and
grants to the producers who make the capacity available on the market it also includes the payment that terna collects
from the withdrawal dispatching users and grants to the operators which supply the load interruption service
a significant proportion of passthrough items consist of uplift a tariff component which includes various system costs
including covering the net expenses incurred to procure resources on the dispatching service market dsm in 2014
passthrough revenues and costs for the terna group totalled  58822 million  58073 in 2013


2014 incentive schemes
the authority has introduced specific bonus and penalty schemes aimed at encouraging service improvement both in
terms of technical reliability and cost as is implicit with incentive mechanisms upon reaching objectives the benefit to
service users will be a multiple of the incentive paid to terna in particular in 2014 incentive mechanisms were provided for
 the quality of the transmission service nontariff incentive mechanism resolution 19711 valid 20122015
 the promotion of investments of particular importance tariff incentive mechanisms additional wacc and investment
  acceleration resolution 19711 valid 20122015
the bonusespenalties connected to whether or not the objectives are achieved as established in the incentive schemes
are included in ternas total regulated revenue


the cost of transmission on the end users bill
in accordance with current regulations the majority of ternas recognised costs are billed to end customers of the electric
service by the distribution companies even without an official breakdown of the costs for the domestic end user which
directly shows the impact of the costs resulting from ternas activity based on the figures published by aeegsi it can be
estimated that the transmission costs have a weight of about 35 on the electricity bill of an average domestic user21




risk management

since over 90 of terna groups revenues are derived from activities recognised and remunerated by the authority for
electricity gas and water the risks arising from changes to the regulatory framework could have a significant impact
on achieving objectives this particular context which transforms some market risks into regulatory risks influences our
approach to risk management
terna which is part of the countrys critical infrastructure assesses and analyses possible risk scenarios paying
particular attention to operational risks in order to reduce service disruption and damage to the health of staff in the
workplace and to optimise business processes
for these reasons the corporate governance model which terna has adopted is committed to giving adequate
consideration to all interests involved in particular the remuneration committee and the audit and risk committee are
present in the context of the board of directors the audit and risk committee has a consultative and advisory function
supporting the board in decisions which relate both to internal audit systems and risk management with regard to
periodic checks to ensure the adequacy and efficacy of this system in accordance with the companys characteristics
and risk profile the audit and risk committee is comprised entirely of nonexecutive directors and has an independent
majority at least one member has adequate experience in accounting and finance for more details on governance
structure and hierarchy please refer to the report on corporate governance and ownership structures published
alongside the terna and terna group financial report corporate policy on the internal audit system also establishes a
direct relationship between the audit and risk committee and the chief risk officer cro
the chief risk officer cro  appointed in may 2013 by the director in charge of the internal audit and risk management
system after consultation with the audit and risk committee  is responsible for supporting senior management in
their handling of the risk management process at the group level effectively with respect to all financial operational
business and other risks terna carries out this process by using the enterprise risk management erm methodology in
accordance with sector best practices
21 this is the relation between the unit cost of transmission which the distributing companies pay to terna and the cost of electricity for an average
   domestic consumer family with 3 kw of committed power and 2700 kwh of annual consumption terna calculations using aeegsi data

     88 2014 sustainability report



         as part of the integrated and systematic risk management which distinguishes it terna adopts structural management
         tools and prevention measures in line with its own risk management rationale
         with regard to reputational risk across all of the groups activities protection is guaranteed and strengthened by a
         sustainable approach to business starting from the assumption that legal compliance is a must this considers the
         potential environmental and social consequences so as to prevent and mitigate the effects of such risks
         finally terna constantly monitors risks associated with aspects of sustainability which may have a negative impact on its
         reputation and its intangible value including through ratings analyses by the main agencies which periodically conduct
         sustainability assessments such as robecosam vigeo and eiris
         for a full description of the procedures for preventing and managing such risk see the 2014 annual financial report


         climate change risks and opportunities
g4ec2
         terna as a utility company transmits electricity as its main task it is not involved in any way in the generation of electricity
         and thus is not subject to any obligation to reduce emissions or to any emissiontrading schemes
         at present there are no fiscal eg a carbon tax or regulatory measures eg emissionreduction targets inclusion in
         emissiontrading schemes which have direct consequences on ternas business and financial performance
         ternas management has identified potential albeit remote risks connected with global warming and the reactions that
         it may provoke within governments and in terms of customer attitudes
         ares of overlap with ternas work are as follows
          the task of maintaining a balance between the input and withdrawal of electricity tofrom the transmission grid becomes
            more difficult when weather conditions are extreme examples of this include during water shortages and in extreme
            heat or freezing conditions there is an increased probability of critical situations which can result in the temporary
            disconnection of users in certain areas of the country this consequently draws the attention of the public authorities
            and the mass media to terna in this regard terna is carrying out research initiatives in two directions the first is
            oriented to increasing knowledge of the potential consequences of extreme weather scenarios  in line with the ipcc
            intergovernmental panel on climate change data  on grid infrastructure and on transmission operations the second
            is aimed at developing technological solutions for securing the service in specific adverse weather conditions see the
            section technology and innovation
          concern over climate change could lead to a reduction in the elasticity of energy demand to gdp growth research
            into greater energy efficiency has already altered the traditional relationship between economic growth and demand
            for electricity this trend could also result in lower growth in the demand for electricity than currently seen under equal
            conditions the rules adopted so far by the aeegsi regarding the remuneration of the transmission service currently
            make it unlikely that the possible reduction in volume could translate into a decrease in revenue for terna
          the increase in the production of energy from renewable sources poses various challenges for terna in relation to the
            need to plan and implement investments to resolve grid congestion problems and for efficient and safe management of
            nonprogrammable production furthermore intermittent production in particular wind production makes dispatching
            more difficult increasing the need for power reserves and regulation
         on the contrary climate change has provoked changes in legislation to encourage renewable energy sources this has
         already provided terna with opportunities to explore new business avenues
         investments in the transmission grid made necessary by connecting renewable energy plants are a source of revenue
         for terna furthermore grid development investment has significant consequences in terms of reducing emissions
         throughout the electric system reduction of losses improvement in the production mix connection to new renewable

the predominance of national and local suppliers is a consequence of the specific nature of the business and in particular
of the need to perform fast maintenance work on plants to ensure the utmost security of the electrical system suppliers
located in geographical proximity to the plants also guarantee more competitive transport costs for heavy and bulky
supplies contributing in this way also to reducing the related environmental impact
with a view to expanding the supplier portfolio the market is continuously scouted this implies rigorous meetings with
both italian and overseas potential suppliers
in the different stages of the procurement cycle terna pays attention to the suppliers characteristics as regards legality
technical and organizational capacity and environmental sustainability and social responsibility issues as far as the latter
are concerned monitoring to guarantee correctness is based on various tools which create more stringent conditions
when the product categories are more significant for terna or owing to the potential social and environmental impact of
the suppliers businesses
all suppliers are required to commit contractually to behave in compliance with the provisions of ternas code of ethics
and model 231 sanctions are impose for any misconduct although a preponderant proportion of suppliers are italian in
the other cases the supplier is always subject to screening in relation to country of origin in cases of countries at risk as
regards respect for human rights or corruption specific further investigations are carried out see the box on page 91
for procurement that regards the performance of activities linked to ternas core business instrumental contracts
and which mainly comprise supplies of electrical materials and equipment work contracts and services in the sectors
of electricity transmission telecommunications and information technology the legal regulations provided for in the
contracts code apply numerous requirements for contractualisation involve environmental and social aspects human
rights working conditions among these for example checks on regular payment of contributions no breaches of
workplace safety laws and no environmental crimes the integrity pact validated in its most recent form in 2014 by
transparency international entails commitments in relation to integrity and combating corruption in 2014 social and
environmental requisite criteria were used in the phase of awarding tenders according to the bestbid principle
finally for certain sectors specific social and environmental requirements are introduced at the qualification stage

    assessment of esg criteria in qualifying suppliers

    most of the product categories that are most significant for the core business from a technical and economic point of
    view are subject to qualification this qualification is managed with a system on the basis of which only companies
    capable of demonstrating requisites of legislative compliance in line with that of the contracts code and of technical
    and organizational quality and financial solidity are selected and added to the relevant register besides these in areas
    at greater risk from the point of view of sustainability an adequate level of environmental management and the ability to
    protect worker health and safety are also required for example through possession of management systems certified in
    accordance with the international iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 standards
    of all the qualified suppliers 63 have acquired or are acquiring bs ohsas 180012007 safety certification and 64
    have acquired or are acquiring iso 140012004 environmental certification
    terna is committed to ensuring a response in good time to all companies that intend to qualify in 2014 49 new suppliers
    were found to be suitable and a total of 360 companies are present on the register

                                                                                                                                       economic responsibility 91

      country risk in relation to ternas procurement activities is understood as the possibility of suffering damage on
      the occurrence of circumstances or events which can be linked to the economic social and political context of the                                         g4hr6
      country in which the supplier normally operates this risk is much less than that associated with environmental and
      health and safety matters but could assume greater significance as the procurement markets expand and more
      generally owing to ternas foreign expansion strategy to analyse and assess the most significant risk factors
      which relate to the macroareas of economic and political governance of the various countries and to observance
      of the human rights established at the international level objective elements are used including ratification of the
      un and ilo conventions combined with the assessments expressed by the main international nongovernmental
      organizations and by the most important ratings agencies working in the fields in question these assessments are
      updated in general every year and therefore constitute a source of constant monitoring of the effective evolution of
      the situation these assessments are combined with reporting of the restrictive measures issued by the italian and
      european authorities which entail both limitations on the free circulation of goods trade embargoes and rules of
      conduct in the case of transactions with countries offering tax advantages tax havens

      the data take into account the term of construction contracts and the variations in the workforce required and relate to various types of terna work
      contracts from large construction sites to cutting vegetation under power lines the days worked and the fte units are estimated on the basis of the
      average daily presences at the largest construction sites and the amounts paid for contracted work on smaller sites no further information is available
      on the types of contracts used by contractors


considering the significant use of external labour on ternas construction sites work contracts are subject to stricter
rules regarding not only qualification but also management particularly with reference to occupational safety
during the supplier qualification process terna requires that documented procedures for protecting the health and
safety of workers be presented for companies in categories considered most significant with regard to safety and
the environment an indepth investigation of the management practices adopted is envisaged by means of a detailed
questionnaire with the objective of reducing the safety risks regarding contract work terna requires additional specific
certifications concerning contractor employees such as
 certification that they understand italian so as to ensure their access to information on constructionsite safety
 at sites for the construction of overhead power lines certification that all workers mainly bluecollar have examined                                          eu18

           activities in 2014
           in line with previous years in 2014 40 construction sites for building lines and substations entrusted to contractors were
           checked across the country the construction sites were chosen on the basis of the duration of the work considering that
           work that lasts longer is probably more complex
           during the inspections not only aspects closely associated with workplace safety were analysed but also those associated
           with environmental protection such as pollution waste management and interference with the surrounding environment
           in june a workshop was organized on applying workplace safety regulations at terna construction sites which was attended
           by the execution safety coordinators escs currently included in the qualified segment terna outlined the characteristics
           of its construction sites and the experience it has gained during the execution of its work to the over 60 professionals who

           standardise safety rules at electricity construction sites guidelines were drawn up in relation to managing the safety aspects
           for activities on hv overhead power lines the guidelines contain the following technical documents
            organization of safety at construction sites for building maintenance and demolition work on overhead power lines
              under the terms of italian legislative decree 8108 and subsequent amendments and additions

            methods of work on tubular supports and pylons
           also in 2014 the intercompany environmental health and safety forum was set up and the leading italian operators of
           network plants and infrastructure take part the aim is to facilitate discussions among companies identify the best safety
           practices discuss interpretations of laws and create a virtuous path of continuous improvement on the subjects of health
           safety and the environment



eu18       equal opportunities and transparency in contractual relationships

           access to tender procedures which normally regulate the awarding of orders is guaranteed for all suitable companies
           according to the principle of equal opportunities and is governed by the regulation on procurement the regulation
           represents the corporate reference document for ternas procurement activity and was prepared on the basis of the
           contracts code italian legislative decree 1632006 which in turn transposes the eu legislation on the subject
           another essential tool for guaranteeing transparency in procurement is the procurement portal the section of the
           institutional website based on criteria of simplicity effectiveness and efficiency through which it is possible to find out
           about competitive tenders and take part in online tenders as well as to complete the qualification procedure for access
           to the register moving towards paperless management in 2014 approximately 1500 requests for online assistance were
           received from suppliers 100 of which were resolved in the times provided for in the corporate procedures

continuous improvement and auditing tools

dialogue with suppliers remains the most important tool to guide their growth from the point of view of ethics environmental
sustainability and social responsibility
from an operational point of view the existence of the suppliers esg requisites after the first qualification stage is verified
over the three years for which the qualification is valid through constant work on checking the supplies which during 2014
translated into 703 audits if conduct is found to no longer be in line with the qualification requirements the supplier may
be warned or suspended temporarily from the register and in the most serious cases removed altogether

          economic relations with service operators

          terna mainly deals with companies which operate within the electricity industry and which belong to one or more of the
          following categories
           distribution companies with which terna regulates the energy transmission service on its own grid
           dispatching users ie producers end customers or wholesalers with which terna regulates the dispatching service
           interruptible customers ie end customers of withdrawals that grant terna the right to interrupt their service
           owners of production plants and owners of grid segments to which terna must guarantee the right to connection in
             compliance with regulatory and technical provisions
          relations between operators within the industry and terna are regulated mainly by the industry authorities and are defined
          technically and commercially in the grid code in particular with regard to the dispatching service terna regulates the
          financial items regarding the procurement of the resources necessary to safeguard the security of the national electric
          system with the users of the input dispatching service thus it maintains the balance between input and withdrawals as
          well as ensuring that grid parameters such as voltage and frequency are at appropriate levels
          the financial items regarding procurement on the dispatching service market dsm and other inputside system expenses
          are liabilities and in 2014 amounted to about 20 billion euro
          the system expenses relative to withdrawal dispatching mainly composed of the uplift payment for dsm resource
          procurement are assets and in 2014 amounted to about 36 billion euro
          moreover with both input and withdrawal dispatching users terna regulates the financial items relating to imbalances
          understood as the difference between the plans the users presented on the electricity markets and the actual value of the
          electricity input or withdrawn with regard to input the amount came to about 02 billion euro expenses for the operator
          while the amount relating to withdrawal came to about 02 billion euro income for the operator most of the interactions
          with electricity operators are managed through the myterna portal a platform created to optimise the commercial
          relationship with counterparts
          the portal represents the main access channel for services dedicated to operators including management of the database
          for requests for connection to the ntg stipulation of withdrawal contracts management of contacts and viewing of the
          main data for each operator in 2014 terna procured resources for interruptibility and instantloadreduction services
          which aim to secure the functioning of the national electric system in the event that resources procured on the market
          were found to be insufficient in 2014 there were 290 assignees of the interruptibility and instantloadreduction service
          for about 3960 mw of power and the related economic liability amounted to about 05 billion euro on an annual basis

    our approach

    terna recognises the importance of the right balance between energy requirements and protecting the environment and
    local communities in carrying out its business it therefore seeks appropriate solutions to ensure italy has the electricity
    it needs in the most reliable economical and environmentally sustainable way
    from an environmental point of view the most significant impact of ternas work is not so much in using natural
    resources or in emitting pollutants but rather the physical presence of power lines and electrical substations and
    their interaction with the surrounding natural and urban environment
    the most significant environmental aspects of ternas work are thus
     the visual impact of substations and lines on the landscape
     the impact of lines on biodiversity with particular regard to birdlife
     special waste and its management
     electric and magnetic fields
     greenhouse gas emissions
    terna has established an environmental policy which expresses its commitment to practices which limit and reduce
    its environmental impact even beyond the limits imposed by law whenever this does not compromise the other general
    interests that it is obliged to protect
    among ternas main environmental commitments the following should be noted
     in the planning of grid development investments listening to the needs expressed by stakeholders in particular local
       institutions and environmentalist associations and seeking agreement on solutions through a process of voluntary
       prior consultation with local institutions see the dedicated section responsible development of the electricity grid
       in the chapter responsibility for the electric service
     in the construction management and maintenance of the grid adopting procedures in accordance with the provisions
       of the law and where possible reducing environmental impact terna has adopted an iso 140012004 certified
       environmental management system which covers 100 of the national transmission grid substations and lines
       and offices since 2013 the environmental management system of terna crna gora has also been iso 140012004
       certified
     in relations with suppliers the requirement to gradually adapt to the environmental standards adopted by terna
     with regard to magnetic fields strict compliance with regulations and attentiveness to the development of scientific
       studies as well as contributing to the correct presentation and understanding of the phenomenon
     with regard to biodiversity the commitment to limit the impact of the grid particularly on birdlife with mitigation
       activities to be identified and finalised including programmes agreed upon with environmental associations
     with regard to climate change a recognition of the importance of the problem and commitment to take action as far as
       is operationally possible to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases
    in organizational terms environmental matters are overseen by several departments responsible for specific aspects
    which are coordinated by the sustainability and environment steering committee
    the environmental responsibility chapter is therefore organized as follows
     description of the environmental aspects of grid development
     thematic focus on handling specific areas of impact electric and magnetic fields biodiversity consumption emissions
       use of materials waste

                                                                                                                         environmental responsibility 99

g4en24   compliance with the law
          in the three years 20122014 no definitive administrative or judicial monetary or nonmonetary penalties were imposed for
g4en29   noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations the tables of indicators section and the paragraph disputes
          and litigation contain further data on environmental litigation and complaints in 2014 as in the previous twoyear period
          there were no significant leaks of pollutant liquids two equipment fires occurred in the electrical substations of two different
          operational areas following actions to put them out carried out by local fire fighters the surrounding areas were restored see
          the sections limiting sf6 leakage and waste below are the main activities completed in 2014 both to adjust to regulations
          and to improve ternas environmental management system
           since march all of ternas operating structures have been authorised to transfer special hazardous waste produced
            following the sistri waste tracking system in line with this change the guidelines defining waste management
            criteria within the group were updated
           over 4500 hours of training were provided on environmental issues among which we note those dedicated to the
            specialised course waste management with sistri attended by 200 technicians
           during 2014 an environmental analysis was published on the impact of the terna groups activities which updates
            the initial environmental analysis published in 2007 in this analysis which is the foundation of the environmental
            management system all the environmental impacts deriving from the activities carried out by the group companies
            were identified and described by site type for each activity the specific impacts were defined additionally the
            relevant national and local standards were identified as well as the indicators and the associated monitoring methods
            in total 36 environmental aspects were identified and analysed
           activities dedicated to containing the noise produced by electricalsubstation equipment continued specifically in 2014 a
            technical guide was published for the definition of general solutions to reduce the noise produced by transformation equipment
            in electrical substations in addition investments were completed aimed at reducing noise in two electrical substations
           for the period 20112018 tree camouflaging is foreseen for 14 electrical substations under construction as of 2014
            three of these camouflaging projects have been completed




          managing the environmental impact of grid development

g4en27   lines and local communities
g4so2    the construction of new lines responds to the technical needs of the electric system  such as removing congestion
          and eliminating risks of overload  and to increasing energy production and consumption which accompanies the
          economic growth of specific areas or of the entire country terna includes the necessary new constructions in the
          grid development plan which every year follows a complex authorisation procedure for the authorisation procedure
          of each specific project see also the monitoring platform terna building sites in italy available on the website
          httpwwwternaitdefaultaspxtabid101 while grid development caters to societys general interest the environmental
          impact of the construction of new power lines is instead concentrated on the area affected by the line route in addition the
          population density of many parts of italy and the artisticcultural value and landscape of many other parts make planning
          more complex and construction more difficult in response to these problems terna has voluntarily adopted an approach
          involving dialogue and consultation with institutions so as to find solutions for preserving the richness and potential of the
          countrys environmental and cultural assets see the paragraph on consultation on pages 6869
          as regards existing lines the need to intervene is usually due to the fact that many lines were built some decades ago
          the gradual urbanisation of rural areas and the adoption of new legal regulations modifying parameters already in force
          regarding the interaction between power lines and the land mean that changes to portions of the existing grid become
          necessary the environmental action preceding the coming into operation of grid development investments are described
          below divided into the following phases planning consultation design and construction


          planning
          during the grid planning phase terna can reduce the impact of power lines on the environment through operations which
          can be divided into two categories
           rationalisation complex work which involves several grid components at the same time consisting mainly of replacing
            plants with better systems eliminating the parts of the grid of negligible use following new constructions or adding new
            grid elements to avoid having to upgrade saturated lines of all the rationalisation work envisaged by the development
            plan there are many more demolitions than new constructions resulting in a positive net effect in terms of the presence
            of power lines around the country dismantling of stretches of line made possible by the construction of new power
            lines this is the most significant benefit for the environment resulting from grid development work

                                                                                                         environmental responsibility 101



 reclassification converting existing power lines to a higher voltage by constructing new conductors and pylons in
  place of the existing ones this can involve replacing old pylons with larger ones which therefore take up more space
  however reclassification compared with constructing a new line has the advantage of generally using preexisting
  infrastructural corridors avoiding taking over new land

consultation
from 2002 onwards terna has chosen to voluntarily bring forward discussions with local communities to the project
planning stage of its development plan the dialogue with local institutions at the consultation stage and the strategic
environmental assessment sea procedure of the development plan offer indications for handling the environmental
impact at the design stage for details of the consultation procedure adopted by terna and the sea see pages 6869


design
through a design process focused on environmental and landscape aspects terna aims to limit the impact on the land
reconciling the public utility need for the plants with protecting the environment and town planning the search for the
route for the construction of a power line is in fact the most delicate design stage because it is the route itself that
determines and conditions interferences with the surrounding landscape and community we work therefore trying to
 limit the length of the route as much as possible in order to occupy the smallest possible portion of land
 minimise interference with areas of environmental naturalistic landscape and archaeological value
 cause the least harm possible to the properties involved taking care to assess the existing situations on the land to be
  crossed compared also to the conditions of the surrounding area
 avoid as far as possible involving builtup or urban development areas
 identify a route that enables the future regular operation and maintenance of the power line
great attention is paid to minimising visual impact in particular through the following actions
 burying cables which eliminates or reduces the visual impact typical of overhead stretches of line negatively perceived
  above all in builtup areas however burying cables although appreciated and requested by local institutions is problematic
  from a technical and economic point of view underground lines are less reliable over time than overhead lines and take
  much longer to repair in the event of a malfunction for this reason they often do not ensure adequate security for the
  electrical system and service continuity in addition buried cables have a greater impact in the construction stage  for
  example in terms of road traffic  and much higher construction costs from five to ten times the cost of an overhead line
 choosing pylons with a reduced visual impact over the last few years terna has expanded the available alternatives
  and has also turned to internationally renowned architects to design new pylons see the box on the following page
for the construction of new electrical substations similar considerations apply


construction
                                                                                                                                        eu13
to manage the environmental impact of its construction sites terna has adopted operating guidelines  management
of the environmental aspects during plant construction  to ensure observance of the environmental policy adopted by
the company one aspect to which particular attention has been paid is identifying construction site areas and access
routes which are located where compatible with the technical and planning needs in areas of less naturalistic value
when the project is complete terna provides for the restoration of the sites involved back to their original state if these
areas involve natural or seminatural habitats further green work is also carried out
ternas environmental policies which are applied also at construction sites were formulated according to the provisions
of the applicable environmental laws and the prescriptions of the iso 14001 standard this includes aspects such as
preventive measures against contaminating aquifers limiting damage to vegetation managing accidents minimising air
and noise emissions and vehicle use and correctly managing waste and excavated land see page 100 on this subject


mitigation and compensation                                                                                                           g4en13
in compliance with the requirements expressed during the authorisation procedure terna adopts mitigation measures
to reduce the impact andor improve integration into the environment of the electrical structures
in particular terna creates systems to hide electrical substations from places frequented by tourists or those of landscape
environmental interest redevelops buildings prefers to locate lines where they take advantage of natural morphology
makes use of naturalistic engineering techniques for managing water and forestry systems and stabilising slopes
if the mitigation measures are not sufficient to reduce the interference to insignificant levels environmental offsetting
measures are adopted that is environmental regeneration or habitat reconstruction work on areas close to the power
line such as balancing out the trees cut along the lines in the projects by planting individual trees of the same species
over equivalent areas

         ternas new pylons
          terna increasingly considers pylons not just as necessary technical grid infrastructure but also as objects to blend
          in harmoniously with the landscape limiting their visual impact and giving them new functions safeguarding the
          environment and biodiversity
          for most of the overall route of the main works completed trino  lacchiarella or under construction foggia
           benevento sorgente  rizziconi italy  france and italy  montenegro terna is already using low
          environmentalimpact pylons such as the singlestem poles or germoglio pylons alongside these two types
          the foster pylon is used this is the first pylon with which terna has experimented in supplementing the basic
          technical function with an artistic component

          the singlestem pylon  this is the lowenvironmentalimpact pylon which offers
          a reduction of up to 15 times the area occupied by the lines and the ground surface
          occupied by pylons from 150 square metres for a truncated pyramidal pylon down
          to 10 square metres
          this pylon is already in use along some of the latest lines constructed by terna
          in particular the chignolo po  maleo 380 kv power line for which 70 of the
          total route has singlestem pylons for a total of 88 the trino  lacchiarella line
          which has a total of 201 and the first stretch of the foggia  benevento line with
          40 pylons other singlestem pylons are in use on the laino  rizziconi line 5 and
          the s fiorano  robbia line 2
          as regards instead lines under construction for udine  redipuglia 114 singlestem
          pylons are planned while for the benevento 2  benevento 3 stretch of the foggia
           benevento there are another 28
          this solution offers advantages also as regards assembly requiring just a few hours
          compared to an average of five days for a traditional pylon and safety given the
          reduction in work at height by bluecollar workers

                                      the foster pylon  this is the design pylon which won norman foster one of
                                      the major exponents of hightech architecture the international award pylons for the
                                      environment held by terna in 1999 and which marked the transition from technical
                                      design to one blending in with the landscape some units have been operating for
                                      some time along the santa barbara  tavarnuzze  casellina line




          the germoglio pylon  winner of the pylons of the future competition launched
          by terna in 2007 and concluded in 2009 to find new design solutions for pylons
          able to change the visual perception designed by architect hugh dutton head of
          the giorgio rosental architecture group this pylon has been in use since 2013 it is
          located between piedmont and lombardy along a section of the 380 kv trino 
          lacchiarella power line

                                                                                                                               environmental responsibility 103




monitoring and supervision of electromagnetic fields

protection from exposure to electromagnetic fields is precisely defined by law the relative legislation prime ministers
decree of 8 july 2003 establishes
 exposure limits in case of exposure to electric and magnetic fields at a frequency of 50 hz generated by power lines
  the limit is 100 microteslas for magnetic induction and 5 kvm for the electric field understood as effective values
 caution values as a precautionary measure protecting against the possible longterm effects of exposure to magnetic
  fields generated at the grid frequency 50 hz in childrens play areas residential areas school sites and places where
  people stay for at least four hours a day the caution value for magnetic induction is 10 microteslas understood as
  the median value over 24 hours under normal operating conditions
 quality objectives in planning new power lines near sensitive areas as above and in planning new settlements and
  areas in the vicinity of lines and installations already present the quality objective is set at 3 microteslas for the value of
  magnetic induction understood as the median value over 24 hours under normal operating conditions this is in order
  to gradually minimise exposure to electric and magnetic fields generated by power lines operating at a frequency of
  50 hz to ensure that quality objectives are met in agreement with the regional environmental protection agencies
  electric and magnetic field measurements for new power lines are provided for in the monitoring plans both in the
  pre and postconstruction stages
the values of the three parameters and in particular the caution value 10 microteslas and the quality objective
3 microteslas show that the italian legislator has adopted the precautionary approach expressed by article 15 of the
rio principles these parameters are the lowest at the european level22 observance of the law in its work implicitly entails
ternas adoption of the same principle
terna carries out line inspections to ensure compliance with the limits set out by current legislation in the event of any
reports and requests by responsible bodies and administrations terna provides the data needed to assess the effective
exposure to electric and magnetic fields generated by its plants
finally with the objective of providing accurate but easily comprehensible information on the subject terna has provided
a further explanation of electromagnetic fields emfs in the sustainability section of its website




safeguarding biodiversity                                                                                                                                     eu13

                                                                                                                                                            g4en27
the relationship between the terna grid and the surrounding natural environment and consequently its impact on
biodiversity assume different features in the newline construction phase and in the existingline operation phase
in the construction stage the impact on biodiversity is associated with site work opening up routes so as to be able
to erect pylons excavate and remove residual materials the construction of new lines and substations requires particular
attention to be paid when near or in protected areas
in the operating stage of existing lines the potential impact on biodiversity is twofold on the one hand the line route                                  g4en11
may be a factor increasing biodiversity and protecting certain species because the pylons and their bases constitute
islands of concentrated biodiversity sparing areas of land from intensive farming on the other hand the lines potentially                              g4en12
have negative effects on biodiversity in particular on birds and in protected areas or areas of natural interest
the interaction between the lines and these areas is constantly monitored to limit the risk of negative impact on birdlife
the main tool used to identify critical line sections is a comprehensive regional database populated with data from the
regions and ministries the geographic information system gis this system allows for integrated analysis of all layers of
information for various types of land use and protection constraints regional naturalistic cultural landscape etc using
the gis terna has put together an inventory of all possible interference between its lines and areas with protected
or high levels of biodiversity 10 of ternas electricity grid amounting to 5625 km crosses protected areas for
stretches ranging from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres against an extension of protected land areas as a total
and net of overlaps for a surface area of over 20 of italian national territory
with a view to environmental sustainability biodiversity and protected areas therefore constitute an important element in
grid development planning the biodiversity characteristics of areas potentially destined to host a new infrastructure are
carefully studied the information gathered is included in the criteria for determining the final route and is available in the
environmental report in the volumes detailing regional aspects which accompany the grid development plan
this approach was confirmed in the memorandum of understanding signed by terna and the wwf in 2009 and renewed
in 2013 which provides for the incorporation of environmental criteria consistent with the wwfs conservation strategy in
the planning of new lines

     despite the precautions taken in the planning stage it is possible that interference may occur between the single works
     and certain species or habitats to reduce this interference to a minimum environmental mitigation measures where
     necessary supplemented by environmental offsetting measures are adopted see also page 102
     to reduce the risk of collision for birdlife to a minimum for stretches of line where birds frequently cross special
     devices known as dissuaders have been installed due to their size and the noise they make when struck by the
     wind they make electricity lines more easily perceivable to birds in flight in 2014 there were 13397 dissuaders
     compared to 12005 in the previous year
     terna deals with biodiversity in partnership with leading national bodies which work to protect the environment and animal
     species
     in 2014 terna continued to support the nests on pylons initiative in cooperation with the ornithological association
     ornis italica which every year makes it possible to collect various biological and ethological data revealing a positive
     effect in terms of biodiversity alongside this the birdcam project provides for the installation of television cameras on
     artificial nests to follow the birds reproduction period online on ternas website and on wwwbirdcamit
     further information and indicators of ternas commitment to preserving biodiversity on the projects pursued with its
     partners and the main results are available in the sustainability section of the website wwwternait




         ternas pylons in the repopulation of the white stork
         the white stork ciconia ciconia is a migratory species found in the centraleuroasian mediterranean area in fact
         it nests in europe italy france austria and switzerland in asia minor turkey and in north africa and spends the
         winter to the south of the sahara desert
         there has been evidence of the storks presence in italy since the times of the roman empire numbers started to
         decline in the 16th century and the stork disappeared completely a century later
         the spontaneous return of the stork to italy  first simply passing through in the spring and autumn and then staying
         during the breeding season  began in the 1950s and since then a slow yet steady increase in numbers has been
         recorded with 160 breeding pairs counted in 2005 in that year nesting took place in piedmont lombardy veneto
         friulivenezia giulia emiliaromagna tuscany calabria puglia sicily
         and sardinia with 14 of the total population being concentrated in
         piano di gela in sicily
         when migrating the stork is a gregarious species and forms great
         flocks but during the breeding season it becomes strongly territorial
         solitary breeding pairs or local groups nest on trees buildings
         pylons or artificial structures such as the aforementioned pylons this
         behaviour has allowed terna to become involved in some initiatives
         concerning the repopulation of this species
         the first began in 2013 in prato tuscany when volunteers from the
         centro di scienze naturali natural sciences centre made terna aware
         of the presence of a nest of storks on one of its pylons a collaboration
         was formed from this which resulted in the installation of a webcam near
         the nest so that all the stages of the reproductive cycle could be followed
         from the laying and incubation of the eggs to the hatching and fledging
         of the newborn storks the same year an environmental education
         programme was established for school pupils in prato they chose the
         names nuvola cloud and tuono thunder for the two storks and
         drew them for the my storks competition in part sponsored by terna
         in 2014 the pylons artificial trees and biodiversity photo contest
         was launched by terna together with other information initiatives in
         collaboration with unicoop and the province of prato
         a similar initiative has been established in the municipality of
         crevalcore bologna where terna working with the town council
         has installed a series of platforms perches on some of its pylons to encourage the white stork to nest again
         all the reproductive stages were observed in the name of education and science by a webcam installed by terna
         as well as the organization of public events aimed at enhancing local protected areas the results of these web
         monitoring activities food spectrum feeding frequency and other behavioural aspects were presented at the end
         of 2014 during a scientific workshop organized by the municipalities of the emilia region that belong to the giapp
         integrated management of the protected areas of the po valley network

                                                                                                                                 environmental responsibility 105




energy efficiency and climate change

ternas business is electricity transmission and not production which in the electricity industry  and among all business
activities in general  are those most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions for this reason terna is not subject to
emissionreduction obligations according to the kyoto targets nor to emissiontrading schemes of any kind but it has
still chosen to commit itself voluntarily to containing emissions in this light in 2014 terna decided to respond to the
urging of the international cdp originally carbon disclosure project and adhere to the cdp road to paris initiative
subscribing to three commitments emission data transparency elimination from the supply chain of procurement leading
to deforestation and public support for the objective of reducing greenhouse gases in view of the united nations
conference on climate change planned for 2015 in paris the objective of the cdp is to mobilise the corporate world to
reduce its impact on the environment
as well as monitoring and programmes to contain its emissions some of ternas activities lead to significant reductions
in co2 emissions in the overall electric system the following are of note
 the investments provided for in the development plan pages 110112
 the reduction of resources procured on the dispatching service market which also entails a lower demand for
  production with the same level of service page 94

the transmission of electricity requires direct consumption of energy only for a few activities that support the service                                      g4en5
in particular
 fuel for the company vehicles in use for line inspections repairs and other activities mainly connected with the
   maintenance of lines and substations in 2014 there was a slight increase in fuel consumption 5 mainly attributable
   to changes in the perimeter of the plants and an increase in the construction sites managed for details on company
   operating vehicles see page 110
 diesel for emergency generators which are used only in cases where electricity  the normal energy source for
   equipment  is lacking precisely to ensure that the electric system is controlled and normal service restored it is
   estimated that across italy generators were used for a total of 1342 hours consumption of 08 gj per hour
 heating oil and natural gas for heating particularly in offices
the indirect consumption of energy consists of the electricity used to run substations and operating plants 85 of the
total and in offices and workshops the figure for office consumption is 101614 gj which as a ratio to ternas total

g4en16
          as well as direct and indirect energy consumption direct greenhousegas emissions connected with ternas work are caused
          by sf6 sulphur hexafluoride leaks a greenhouse gas used in substation equipment for its highly insulating properties
          sf6 leaks are the main source of direct greenhousegas emissions by terna in particular in 2014 they account
          for 90 of total direct emissions in the last fiveyear period the quantity of sf6 present in the terna groups plants
          increased by 174 tonnes 48 this is a trend  common to many transmission operators  destined to continue in the
          next few years for technical reasons associated with the higher insulating properties of the gas and to the smaller size of
          substations built with equipment containing sf6 compared with more traditional solutions for this reason the absolute
          figure for sf6 leaks also tends to increase programmes to limit the proportion of sf6 leaks are illustrated in the specific

                conversion of direct energy consumption and sf6 sulphur hexafluoride leaks to equivalent co2 emissions is done using the parameters indicated in the
                greenhouse gas protocol ghg initiative and in particular the emission factors indicated in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental
                panel on climate change ipcc indirect consumption of electricity is converted taking into account the proportion of thermoelectric production in the
                total italian electricity production for 2014 the reference for the division of the production mix is the monthly report on the electric system with the
                results for december 2014 available on the website wwwternait

          the increase in direct emissions in 2014 was due mainly to the figure for sf6 leaks up by 19 compared with 2013
          the figure was affected by the accident that occurred in an operational transmission area during which 17877 tonnes
          of co2 equivalent were dispersed into the atmosphere net of this accident ternas direct emissions were equal to
          57403 tonnes confirming the downward trend compared with the previous year




                co2 emissions comparative data
                the figures used for comparison as regards the emission of co2 are composed of the relative figures on direct and
                indirect emissions aims 1 and 2
                the unit of measure used for the comparison is the co2 equivalent expressed in thousands of tonnes where
                equivalent co2 means the total gases contribution to the greenhouse effect
                the analysis was done by comparing ternas emission values with those of all three corporate panels companies
                listed on the ftsemib the electric utilities on the dow jones sustainability world index and the tsos
                in the absence of normalisation factors valid for all sectors it was deemed of interest to present the company data
                on co2 emissions in absolute terms  despite the poor comparability such figures which vary greatly in magnitude
                from one case to another at least provide an indication of the extent of greenhouse gas emissions  and therefore
                of the practical need to contain and mitigate them from the point of view of sustainability  in the various sectors
                and companies for 2014 co2 emissions attributed to ternas activities amounted to 142 thousand tonnes 124
                thousand net of the accident previous paragraph on the other hand for 2013 the year with which a comparison
                can be made emissions were measured at 138 thousand tonnes of co2
                in the comparison with all three panels for 2013 terna was significantly below the average in the group of electric
                utilities it is the company releasing the least emissions

in addition to the emissions corresponding to electricity consumption ternas most significant indirect emissions are
related to grid losses for the indicators related to emissions produced by staff air miles see page 161

                                                                                                                                                              eu12
grid losses are defined as the difference between energy input by producers including imported energy and final
consumption the losses relevant for terna are those associated with the transmission grid the figure presented in
the table below is based on the direct measurement of energy inputted and withdrawn from the transmission grid
approximately 7500 metres to which corrective technical coefficients are then applied in cases in which the measuring
point does not coincide with the boundaries of the transmission grid it must be noted that terna is responsible for
measuring the energy input into the ntg while for the energy withdrawn terna may on the basis of specific agreements
read the measurements remotely which however remain the responsibility of the distributor companies this entails a
margin of error on the correctness of the measurements of electricity withdrawn which has reduced over the years thanks
to crosschecks and the gradual resolution of discrepancies with the distributors data for these reasons starting from
2012 it was decided to use the simple moving average of losses with a threeyear window 20102012 for the year 2012
20112013 for the year 2013 20122014 for the year 2014 as the annual figure in this way the margin of error and the
risk of interpreting the effect of measurement errors and related corrections as real trends is reduced

terna can only contribute to determining the amount of losses which are not completely under its control dispatching
 needed to ensure the constant balance between injections and withdrawals and to avoid gridsecurity and
servicedisruption problems  takes place according to regulated criteria within the framework of production setup
determined by the energy market and cannot therefore be conditioned by terna so as to minimise losses
grid development however with equal production setups would lead to greater efficiency and thus a reduction in
losses however the real impact of grid development on losses cannot be predetermined nor is it under the control of
the grid operator since it depends on the evolution of production capacity and the demand and supply of electricity on
a local basis
considering the production mix of the italian generation system the co2 emissions associated with grid losses amounted
to 1646235 tonnes for the year 2014 they were 1662890 in 2013 and 1771477 in 2012

g4en19   initiatives to reduce emissions

          terna focuses its attention on a number of voluntary action programmes aimed at reducing its main sources of
          greenhousegas emissions in particular on
           a programme to limit the proportion of sf6 leaks terna has launched several initiatives such as identifying leaks
            promptly by means of online monitoring systems and seeking technological solutions which improve the sealing of
            equipment and components
           a programme for energyefficient buildings offices
           feasibility studies for energy conservation initiatives in electrical substations


          limiting sf6 leakage
          thanks to its chemical and physical properties that make it an excellent insulator the gas sf6 sulphur hexafluoride is
          used as insulation in certain electrical devices such as switches current transformers and armoured systems these
          enable the construction of electrical substations in smaller spaces and with fewer maintenance needs thanks to these
          properties devices with sf6 gas insulation are expected to be used increasingly as is happening also abroad with other
          transmission operators
          part of the gas present in the devices is dispersed into the atmosphere owing to defective seals faults and sometimes
          also during operations to restore pressure sf6 gas is classified as a greenhouse gas terna works to keep sf6 leaks
          under control limit and if possible reduce their percentage as a ratio to the total gas used if in fact leaks in absolute
          terms may increase owing to the greater use of gas a reduction in the proportion of leaks would precisely for this reason
          have a significant impact in terms of emissions avoided
          although the proportion of sf6 leaks has been identified as a significant indicator of ternas performance in relation to
          climate change studies are still being done to identify a target there are in fact several elements of uncertainty
           the growth of awareness of and attention to the issue has been reflected in an improvement in measuring leaks
             entailing  precisely in the years when limiting activity began 20092010  worsening performance in all probability
             only apparent
           the occurrence of faults with significant gas leaks  the probability of which is growing given the increasing use of sf6
             gas in equipment at large substations  can alter the trend considerably
           while on the one hand installing equipment with better sealing performance tends to reduce the proportion of leaks on
             the other the ageing of equipment already installed could entail an increase in leaks
           terna already records low figures for the proportion of sf6 leaks compared with other tsos see the specific box
             in this paragraph so further reductions which have growing marginal costs can only be moderate and most likely
             counterbalanced by the aforementioned adverse factors with a potentially greater impact
          net of exceptional faults and any effect deriving from ageing of the equipment in operation it is estimated that installing
          new devices with better seals such as more highly reliable transformers which began in 2009 and continued in the
          years 20102012 may determine a reduction in the proportion of leaks estimated at 01 over a period of five years
          from the start of the installation campaign provided that the new equipment is effectively available on the basis of
          this estimate and again net of the factors mentioned we expect the proportion of leaks to converge towards figures
          oscillating around 06 considering that the average proportion in the period 20052009 was 07

          energy saving in substations and offices
g4en6
          in 2011 the energy consumed for own use management system project was launched this is coordinated by the
          terna groups technician responsible for conservation and rational use of energy energy manager following the activities
          performed over the last three years the objective in 2015 is to have the system certified to the uni cei en iso 50001 standard
          which establishes the requisites for creating launching maintaining and improving an energy management system oriented
          towards energy efficiency it should be borne in mind however that the development of energy efficiency programmes relative
          to the use of electricity in substations and offices is experimental at this stage this is due to the fact that ternas electricity
          consumption falls within the own transmission use category which from an accounting point of view constitutes a pass
          through item for terna as regards electrical substations electricity is used to ensure the functioning of the equipment and
          its remote control we are studying initiatives to assess savings opportunities in relation to the main sources of consumption
           cooling power transformers
           external lighting
           airconditioning and heating systems in technical rooms
           auxiliary command control and protection circuits of all equipment and machinery
          in offices the main sources of energy consumption are related to lighting airconditioning heating and the use of
          computers and printers two initiatives in the year related to reducing such sources of consumption are described below
           continued replacement of computers and printers the new models enable savings in average energy consumption
             of 145 and a consequent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions the reduction achieved in 2014 adds to the one
             already recorded in the two years 20122013 related to replacing monitors and desktop computers with pcs with lower
             consumption for a total of 160 tonnes less of co2 for the three years
           a project was completed for replacing the heating oil boilers with two heat pumps and a series of geothermal probes in
             order to reduce the costs and consumption of heating oil for heating the offices of the friulivenezia giulia plants unit
             this investment will have a payback period of five years and will permit a reduction in costs for the company the new
             plant will permit a reduction in the co2 emitted into the atmosphere of approximately 60 tonnes per year the plant
             active since september 2014 has already enabled a reduction of approximately 30 tonnes of co2



          the development plan and reduction of co2 emissions from the electric system

          the construction of the new lines and substations provided for by the development plan will have positive effects not
          only in terms of service security and the final cost of electricity but also in terms of reduced emissions from the electric
          system this has three effects
           reduction of grid losses
           improvement of the production mix and interconnection with other countries
           connection of plants using renewable energy
          overall the reduction in co2 emissions could reach approximately 155 million tonnes a year


          reduction of grid losses
          grid losses depend among other things on the distance the electricity travels on the transmission grid in very simple
          terms the further the point of consumption of withdrawal from the ntg from the point of production of delivery into
          the ntg the greater the losses for the same consumption in addition for the same distance the losses are greater
          on a lowervoltage line development work that improves the grid mesh structure brings withdrawal and consumption
          points closer all other conditions being equal the result is a reduction in grid losses the same result is produced by
          upgrading a stretch of the grid for example when a 380 kv line replaces one at 150 kv over the same route with the
          completion of the work set out in the 2015 development plan the decrease in losses at the peak could reach a power
          value of approximately 180 mw corresponding to a reduction in grid energy losses estimated of around 1100 gwhyear
          assuming that the reduction of these losses is equivalent to a reduction in production from combustible sources it can be
          considered that the work may also have the added positive effect of a decrease in co2 emissions somewhere between
          400000 and 500000 tonnes every year

improvement of the production mix and interconnection with other countries
one of the main purposes of developing the electricity transmission grid is to overcome the transport limits between
electricity zones the existence of these limits imposes a number of restrictions on the possibility of production by more
efficient generation units that is to say units which pollute less in terms of co2 emissions and at the same time makes
production by obsolete substations necessary for grid security
the work envisaged in the development plan together with the expansion of interconnection with other countries would
enable a more efficient production mix with a larger proportion of production by plants with higher yields the same
quantity of final consumption would thus be covered with a smaller quantity of fuel the benefits are quantifiable as a
reduction in co2 emissions of up to 8000000 tonnes a year


connection of plants using renewable energy
the main contribution to the reduction of co2 emissions comes from connecting production plants using renewable
sources considered among the projects in the 2015 development plan one of ternas main tasks is to plan grid upgrading
in order to encourage production of electricity from renewable energy sources the aim is to try to overcome any grid
and operating limitations that could impact renewableenergy input into the grid which is entitled to dispatching priority
the development solutions planned include both actions to strengthen sections of the primary grid which make it possible
to indirectly reduce the influence of nonprogrammable renewablesource hereinafter referred to as nprs production on
operation and actions to locally expand the subtransmission grids to which the nprs generation is directly connected
see the relevant paragraph on page 76
besides this work nprs collection substations on the veryhighvoltage grid are planned which will make it possible to
limit the construction of new power lines which would otherwise be needed
from 2005 to 2014 works on the transmission grid and connections have facilitated an increase in the production of
energy from renewable sources see graph below

         reduction of co2 emissions in 2014
         in 2014 the benefits in terms of reduction of system co2 emissions were mainly due to the installation of new
         zeroemission production units
         the provisional figure for power installed from renewable sources in 2014 is presented below

         from the 2014 provisional figures it can be seen that the gross production using wind and photovoltaic energy increased
         by approximately 2200 gwh this figure corresponds to a reduction of approximately 1300000 tonnes of co224

         assets power lines pylons conductors insulators transformer substations transformers switches other substation
         equipment and control systems are the main components
         the use of materials is related in particular to constructing electricity and ict infrastructure ternas direct waste

   lca  life cycle assessment
   in 2013 in cooperation with cesi terna began a life cycle assessment lca for the standard cable line projects
   operating at 380 kv in compliance with the iso 14040 standards see 2013 sustainability report pages 103104
   for the purposes of the study the following functional unit was taken into consideration 1 km of double threephase
   power lines in buried 380 kv cable inclusive of joints and terminals considering the laying method as an integral
   part of the functional unit in the case in point direct underground laying on a level on city and suburban roads
   numerous environmental impact categories were considered and measured for the lifecycle stages cable
   production operation decommissioning and end of life
   the results of the study showed that the operation phase is the most important for the following environmental
   impacts
    reduction of the ozone layer
    land occupation
    global warming
    consumption of nonrenewable energy
   in fact operation is characterised by grid losses the impact of which requires the production of the corresponding
   electricity lost other environmental impacts  such as the consumption of natural resources copper in particular
   land and water ecotoxicity and emission of carcinogenic substances  are on the other hand associated above
   all with the production phase particularly due to production processes and the extraction of minerals
   the endoflife stage contributes negatively to all impact categories that is it has an effect that compensates for
   the environmental impacts of the other stages of the cycle in other words the process of recycling metals tends
   to reduce the impacts associated with the metal extraction processing and production processes
   specifically recycling of copper parts can reduce the impacts connected with the production of the cable by up
   to 47
   the study also considered construction site activities relative to the commissioning of the cable extraordinary
   maintenance and end of life energy consumption for construction site vehicles amounts to 8953 gj per kilometre
   the details of the information obtained thus far will be researched further in order to identify methods to reduce the
   environmental impact of the product in question for example through revision of the procurement specifications

most of ternas waste is recovered to be sent for production recycling only some residues are sent to the wastedisposal
sites and therefore have an environmental impact
the percentage of waste recovered is around 81 87 in 2013 81 in 2012
such waste derives mainly from maintenance and modernisation works to the electricity infrastructure activities which
depend on technical considerations regarding the security and efficiency of the system the quantity of waste may
therefore change significantly from year to year
as regards waste management operations ternas environmental policy prefers waste recycling over final waste disposal
operations
actual recycling depends however on the materials which make up the waste some materials can easily be separated
and consequently reused for example the iron parts of pylons however in some cases it is impossible or too costly to
separate the parts especially for equipment purchased some years ago
for these reasons the annual changes in the percentage of waste recycled must not be interpreted as representing
a trend

                this includes only the special waste from the production process not that produced by service activities urban waste sewage and waste from
                septic tanks from substations not connected to the sewerage system are not included the figure for sewage and septic tanks was 383 tonnes in 2014
                842 tonnes in 2013 610 tonnes in 2012 in 2014 waste identified as other emulsions produced during an accident that occurred in an operating area
                was also excluded the quantity of these emulsions was 857 tonnes

                waste sent for disposal may differ from the simple difference between waste produced and recovered owing to the temporary storage of waste


          the main special nonhazardous waste types produced by ternas activities consist of uncontaminated metal waste
          deriving from the decommissioning of transformers electrical equipment and machines for example generators no
          longer in use with a recovery percentage that averages 100
          the main hazardous special waste produced by ternas operating activities consists of
           metal waste which derives from the decommissioning of transformers electrical equipment and machinery no
            longer used and contaminated by hazardous substances more than 90 of which is recycled on average after
            treatment by third parties
           batteries lead and nickel which in the event of a blackout enable emergency generators to be turned on to keep the
            energy transportation and transformation service operating during emergencies 100 of which are recycled
           dielectric oils for the insulation of transformers replaced following the regular checks carried out for transformer
            maintenance and which constitute hazardous waste
          waste sent for disposal consists mainly of materials used in the maintenance and cleaning of plants mud oil emulsions
          and rags containing oils and solvents and insulating materials containing asbestos for which no kind of recycling is
          available



g4en31   costs for the environment

          ternas commitment to the environment is reflected in the costs incurred for environmental reasons both as investment
          and as operating expenses environmental costs were shown separately on the basis of the definitions presented below
          by aggregating information deducible from the companys general and management accounting such definitions and
          the methodology described below have been taken from the operating guidelines of the terna group


          recording methods
          environmental costs are identified firstly on the basis of the definitions available in particular those of istat the italian
          national institute of statistics eurostat and the gri as well as on the european commissions recommendation on
          the recognition measurement and disclosure of environmental issues in annual accounts and reports on operations
          recommendation 2001453ec on the basis of this recommendation the term environmental expenditure includes the
          cost of steps taken by an organization or on its behalf by others to prevent reduce or repair damage to the environment
          which results from its operating activities
          secondly the aforesaid definitions were applied to the environmental aspects considered significant for example the
          noise of substations electromagnetic fields etc in the companys iso 14001certified environmental management
          system to identify in the main corporate processes ternas operating and investment activities of environmental
          significance

                                                                                                   environmental responsibility 115



many of ternas activities described in this report entail environmental expenses however several limitations were
introduced in determining the reporting boundary
 exclusion of integrated costs ie regarding activities whose purpose is not exclusively environmental for example
   the use of pylons with innovative features also from the point of view of environmental integration because of the
   subjectivity of accounting for the solely environmental components
 exclusion of the additional costs connected with the consideration of restrictions or requests for safeguarding the
   environment during planning and designing new lines detours and burials
other conditions were that the costs had to be
 significant
 consistent with the annual reporting of accounts operating costs and investment clearly distinguished
 directly booked on the basis of the existing corporate accounting system
this last condition fulfils the need to minimise recourse to estimates based on nonaccounting analyses


investment and operating costs

the table below best shows the costs incurred by terna for the environment see below for more details on the accounting
method used
these costs exclude expenses regarding internal resources and consider only expenses for external purchases an
exception is the environmental activities  existing plants item which includes the costs of internal personnel
in accordance with the method adopted and the footnotes to the table it should be noted that the environmental costs
shown are a subset of the total environmental costs actually incurred as defined above

environmental offsets these are amounts for offsetting the works set out in the grid development plan as determined
by special agreements entered into with local institutions the increase of the amount entered in the table reflects the
progress of the work scheduled in the development plan
environmental impact studies these relate to plants provided for in the grid development plan that are at the
construction stage or in the process of being authorised by the relevant administrations
environmental activities  new plants the amount shown is the result of an estimate on the basis of an analysis
of several large investment projects at least 1 of the total project expense related to environmental items usually
determined by obligations for example camouflaging with trees barriers against noise installation of dissuaders for
birdlife environmental monitoring and analysis of excavated earth and rock therefore a value of 1 of investment
costs for projects with similar features was considered
environmental activities  existing plants the expenses for upgrading existing plants in accordance with environmental
provisions and new regulations for example noise and visuallandscape aspects
demolitions the costs for the definitive dismantling of lines as part of rationalisation projects
costs for environmental activities cutting back vegetation cutting grass waste management and demolitions
dismantling for small amounts not included in investments these cost items which can be determined directly from the
industrial accounting do not exhaust the years total environmental costs but represent the majority of them

in 2014 the groups personnel decreased slightly compared to 2013 at the end of the year the number of employees of
the groups italian companies totalled 3437 5 from 2013 retirement is by far the most common reason for employees
leaving and is concentrated in the highest age brackets the turnover rate for spontaneous resignations is always very
low 032 in 2014 026 in 2013 034 in 2012 the turnover rate of employees aged under 30 was 0 in 2014 and
less than 01 for the threeyear period the total turnover rate therefore essentially reflects terminations owing to
retirement the average length of service of employees who left the company in 2014 was 328 years
in 2014 terna made use of 54 temporary workers compared with 39 in 2013 and 31 in 2012 employees of agencies
that provide a temporary employment service to terna the increase in fixedterm employees reflects the use of the
apprenticeship contract

            in both the first and the second group it is expected that there will be greater use of the option of continuing work
            and developing a better pension in the last quarter of 2014 the company launched an ongoing initiative aimed at
            bringing forward generational change through incentives for voluntary early retirement
            some time ago terna began a series of initiatives to manage generational turnover among the most significant
            are
             the transmission of knowledge and experience often specific exclusively to terna by increasing use of training
               courses taught by inhouse teaching staff
             professional development projects aimed at creating and transmitting technical and managerial skills enabling
               adequate performance of critical roles

terna adopts meritbased systems for selecting developing and paying personnel that recognise and reward performance
all forms of discrimination beginning with the selection and hiring process are explicitly forbidden by the groups code
of ethics
a large majority of employees are men because of the traditional scarcity of female labour supply in more technical
occupations however the presence of women is increasing partly as a result of the general trend in the labour market
which has seen a greater participation of women
the percentage of female employees at terna in italy was 90 at the end of 2005 the year in which terna gained
operating autonomy and has grown continually to reach 115 at the end of 2014



      key figures 2014
       115 of all employees are women 115 in 2013
       176 of all managerial positions are occupied by women 179 in 201325
       271 of all new employees net of bluecollar workers are women 167 in 2013



the main indicators chosen by terna to monitor the equal treatment of men and women show that the management
and development systems adopted do not disadvantage women remuneration figures also show limited gaps between
whitecollar workers and junior executives with wider gaps for senior executives where however fewer individuals are
considered and the differences in salary are therefore more influenced by individual figures

         health  safety and correct working practices
         working in safety without putting health at risk is a fundamental workers right and terna invests greatly in ensuring this
         is respected with regard to its staff
         safety is part of the global corporate culture and those who play a key role in operations are encouraged to be involved
         in paying close attention to these issues and how to improve on them

         rights are also guaranteed for those working for contractors




         ensuring employee safety

         ternas commitment to safety should be seen in the context of existing legislative provisions the italian legislation on
         safety legislative decree 812008 consolidated law on occupational health and safety is among the most stringent in
         europe and obliges companies to carry out a detailed assessment of the risks relating to workers health and safety terna
         specifically focuses on analysing the risks deriving from the interference of the work of contractors and subcontractors
         for all operations that make up the working process at construction sites ternas approach to safety at work hinges on a
         system of instruments that apply to all company processes
          clear safetypolicy guidelines
           the importance of protecting people from physical harm is affirmed in ternas code of ethics the companys
           occupational safety policy specifies the guidelines in the code of ethics for example with an explicit commitment to
           promoting accident prevention for all employees including contractors

in 2014 as in the two previous years there were no fatal occupational injuries among group employees nor were there
cases of fatal or serious accidents including those occurring in previous years for which in the three years considered
corporate liability was definitively ascertained the total number of injuries fell by 12 compared to 2013 from 41 to 36
in addition in 2014 for the first time in the threeyear period considered no serious injuries befell any terna employees
both the injury rate and the lostday rate therefore declined with respect to the previous year in addition the absentee
rate confirmed the downward trend for more details on safety information and injury rates divided by type please see

1 as required by the gri protocols the definitions adopted are those provided for by the international labour organization ilo to facilitate comparison
    with other sources the following notes show the figures of the same indicators calculated with alternative formulae it was not considered necessary to
    further break down the data by region because terna operates only in italy
    injury rate this is the number of injuries with at least one days abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during the year and
    multiplied by 200000 corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator was
    also calculated using a multiplication factor of 1000000 instead of 200000 consequently obtaining an injury rate five times that of the ilo with this
    calculation method the injury rate came out at 63 in 2014 71 in 2013 and 88 in 2012
    lostday rate this is the ratio between the days not worked owing to injury and hours worked in the year multiplied by 200000 days not worked
    are calendar days counted from when the injury occurred to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator was also calculated using a
    multiplication factor of 1000 with this calculation method the lostday rate came out 02 in 2014 03 in 2013 and 03 in 2012
    absentee rate this is the number of days of absence owing to illness strikes and injuries out of the number of days worked in the same period
    multiplied by 200000 to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator was also calculated as a percentage of days worked with this
    calculation method the absentee rate came out at 36 in 2014 37 in 2013 and 38 in 2012
    occupational disease rate this is the total number of cases of occupational disease divided by the hours worked in the year multiplied by 200000
2 to calculate the lostday rate the days not worked related to injuries occurring in 2014 were considered together with any continued absence related
    to injuries occurring during the previous years following the criterion of annual accrual of days of absence this method was also adopted to recalculate
    the 2013 and 2012 rates for this reason the data shown in the table differ from those published previously
3 the reasons for absence considered do not include maternity leave marriage leave study leave leave for trade union activities other cases of paid
    leave and suspensions
4 no hours of absence were ascribable to occupational disease because the type of activities carried out by terna does not entail any work associated
     on the basis of the official legal tables  with the possible onset of occupational diseases ternas occupational disease rate must therefore be
    considered to be always zero



as shown in the table below in 2014 two fatal accidents occurred among employees of contractors and subcontractors
one owing to a fall from a height and the other for reasons still being ascertained

g4hr1    respect for human rights
g4hr2
          the terna group operates in italy where the legal framework and the level of civil development largely guarantee respect
g4hr3    for human rights freedom of association and collective bargaining thus making it noncritical for a company to take
          particular action on these issues with the implementation of specific management policies
g4hr4
          as regards the groups work abroad it is to be noted that in the whole of 2014 ternas projects abroad in the balkans
g4hr5    and north africa did not involve operating activities for example infrastructure construction the company terna crna
          gora founded under montenegrin law in june 2011 three employees with local contracts as at 31 december 2014
g4hr6    adopted the groups code of ethics in february 2012
          since december 2009 terna has been part of the global compact adopting its principles as a formal point of reference
g4hr8    after already having cited them since 2006 in its code of ethics
          without affecting the above and the fact that there are currently no critical issues in principle the managerial
g4hr9    responsibility for human rights rests above all with the human resource and organization procurement and contracts
          and corporate protection departments for guaranteeing respect for human rights and workers protection in contracted
g4hr12
          and subcontracted activities see the paragraph procurement on page 89 and the audit unit for ensuring that
          ternas code of ethics is correctly applied in virtue of this role in 2014 the audit unit carried out a survey to gauge
          the employees perception on the application of human rights within the company and towards suppliers the survey
          investigated observance of the principles of the global compact by the group companies following the indications of the
          united nations ruggie report in regard to human rights see also the specific box on the page 52
          the corporate social responsibility unit finally tracks changes in external references eg international conventions




g4hr4    regulation of strikes within the electric service
          relations with trade unions in the industry also give rise to the regulation of indispensable services that must be

         society

         our approach
         terna provides a service in the general interest society understood in a general sense as the user of ternas service and
         the local communities more directly affected by grid investment projects are key stakeholders the most significant impact
g4so2   of ternas work on local communities is that on the visual landscape ternas approach to this is addressed in the chapter
         environmental responsibility the following section discusses other possible effects on individuals and society
         the construction of new power lines involves the use of between approximately 30 and 250 square meters of land  usually
         agricultural  for each pylon although terna is authorised by law italian law no 1775 of 1933 and presidential decree
         3272001 the consolidated law on expropriations to use an expropriation procedure to obtain land terna prefers
         solutions based on mutual consent paying oneoff compensation for the right of way of the line through private property
         the pursuit of a consensual solution only fails in a minority of cases making coercive measures necessary in the three
         year period 20112014 terna constructed power lines that entailed obtaining easements from 38806 land owners 12072
         in 2014 10179 in 2013 7463 in 2012 7092 in 2011 only in 6 of cases was it necessary to use a coercive easement

g4ec1   community initiatives
         in keeping with the desire to contribute to italys civil growth beyond its infrastructural role terna again in 2014 confirmed
         its support for social cultural and environmental initiatives
         ternas corporate giving work consists mainly in providing financial support to charitable initiatives in addition resources
         are allocated to organizing ternas own initiatives for the benefit of the community corporate assets which are no longer
         useful in the production cycle are donated and support is provided in the form of working time devoted to various
g4so6   initiatives by ternas employees in particular paid hours are assigned to volunteering each single corporate giving
         request is managed in keeping with the groups corporate giving policy and assessed by a specific commission
         made up of the corporate protection external relations and communications and human resource and organization
         directors in all cases as established by ternas code of ethics contributions are never made to political parties or their
g4ec7   representatives
         as outlined in the participation in associations section above terna is a member of the london benchmarking group
         lbg and has adopted an lbg model  developing a customised variation of it  for defining classifying and booking
         company charitable initiatives the model is oriented to accounting for what is done by companies through initiatives
         that generate real external benefits such initiatives may involve contributions in cash gifts portion of sponsorships that
         translates into a real benefit membership of associations that promote csr in kind eg transfer of corporate property
         at the end of its useful life and working time accounting for contributions requires in some cases recourse to non
         accounting criteria and is therefore subject to interpretation however it also has the advantage of correlating the costs
         and benefits of the charitable initiatives in a coherent manner meaning that corporate giving can be strategically planned
         and rationally managed the following table shows the aggregate community initiatives classified according to the lbg
         model carried out by terna in 2014

education and young people

frequenza 200 by we world intervita
terna has supported this project since 2012 first through creativinterna the drawing and photographic competition for
group employees and their children and then in conjunction with the 2013 and 2014 activities of its campus training
centre frequenza 200 named for the minimum number of school days per school year is the first italian network
created to combat school dropouts numbering more than 600000 students of compulsory school age in italy 17 of
the school population having originally started off in milan naples and palermo in 2014 frequenza 200 also spread
to rome turin and bari and has involved a total of 40 comprehensive schools 850 teachers 5000 school children over
2650 families 750 mums 90 professional educators 250 informal workers and 350 volunteers ternas contribution has
funded psychological support for children the provision of educational and recreational materials and meetings with the
cultural mediator the lbg findings showed that 80 of the young people involved in the project successfully completed
the school year and chose to continue their studies




   here come grandma and grandpa the initial results from
   monitoring the impact on the final beneficiaries
   at the end of 2014  a year into the ternaarci milan partnership for the social project here come grandma and
   grandpa  the first results obtained from monitoring the impact on its final beneficiaries have been presented
   by the sda bocconi school of management here come grandma and grandpa is an initiative that aims to
   encourage real opportunities for intergenerational exchanges between elderly volunteers the grandparents and
   young children from preschools in milan supporting the human and learning needs of both parties the results
   from the first year of monitoring  while partial as the comparison with homologous data is still to be completed
   possible at the end of the second year  immediately revealed a multistakeholder dimension to the project
   which consisted of several networks of relationships that intersect and interact with one another firstly sda
   bocconi identified the key individuals that were priorities in achieving the projects social objectives defining
   roles and responsibilities it then divided the initiative into distinct phases in order to monitor and measure the
   performance results and impact on the community and target population more easily the most suitable
   tools for analysis and research were used each time particularly questionnaires focus groups and indepth
   interviews
   these tools accompanied by a swot analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats highlighted
   the projects established strengths as well as areas for improvement overall from the 15 grandparents taking
   part in various fun activities and workshops with 720 children at 12 preschools sda bocconi received responses
   from 47 of the grandparents and 92 of the schools
   the results illustrated a sincere unconditional grandparentchild relationship based on affection beyond the
   teacherpupil dimension the results from the point of view of the grandparentteacher relationship were just as
   positive this was based on honesty and a shared interest in integrating the grandparents contribution into school
   activities a limited connection between the grandparents voluntary contribution and the educational programme
   emerged in the analysis as a point of weakness with a consequent potential difference in objectives more generally
   there is still no centralised coordination of the nonprofits voluntary contributions within the academic world
   however the city of milan is already working on this point by launching a single organizational office the objective
   for next year in addition to putting measurements into place to resolve these weaknesses is to create guidelines
   for the nonprofit sector and local institutions intending to start up similar initiatives the community welfare value of
   which is likely to increase continuously at a time when public resources are in constant decline

         roman kiln in lonato sul garda given a new lease of life with terna
         an ancient roman kiln from the 2nd century bc discovered in a terna electrical substation in brescia in the

         and citizens taking part the story of the kiln began with its fortuitous discovery in a town where such happenings
         are not unusual testimony to the industrial vocation of this area that goes all the way back to the roman empire
         with the preservation of the local environment in mind terna decided to close off the area where the kiln was found
         from the rest of the substation and hand it over to the municipality of lonato del garda on a freeloan basis for it
         to be made into a museum intended for local school tourism
         the signing of the agreement with the municipality of lonato coincided with the internal vote your value initiative
         which was launched in 2010 to support
         the information campaign surrounding

         development project in lonato was
         linked to this last value
         the objective was achieved by the
         lombardy municipality which in
         collaboration with the lombardy
         national heritage protection body and
         terna planned to restore and secure the
         site these works were completed with
         the help of regional and european union
         funding
         terna in addition to freely providing the
         site also created the series of panels that illustrate the history of the kiln from its discovery through to its current
         restoration today the kiln site has no architectural barriers and features a new roof new brickwork a lighting
         system a convenient parking area an educational route with information panels a bookshop and a teaching room
         to hold workshops during school visits
         the corporate value of intelligent management is further shown through the city councils decision to assign the
         management of the site to a nonprofit association in doing so a virtuous triangle between the private public and
         third sector has been created
         the nonprofit is a history archaeology and nature association named la polada wwwassociazionelapolada
         it and facebook page fornace romana di lonato which opens the site between june and september offering
         guided tours booking required for citizens and visitors and from september for school pupils too
         the roman kiln museum in lonato is one of two museum kilns and can be reached by the whole lombardy region
         it has become an example of the intelligent management of a shared heritage site that from now on can be
         enjoyed by students and enthusiasts alike

     at all company offices in conjunction with nonprofit organizations operating in italy and abroad
     the association apurimac has been active in ten main offices with peperuncino an initiative with the purpose of
     raising funds to send medical teams to villages in the peruvian andes
     mobile phones for charity involved collecting used phones and resulted in a donation to support childrens welfare
     projects by coopi and fondazione don orione the christmas market initiative trialled in 2013 in the rome offices
     was replicated in all major terna sites in december 2014 involving over twenty associations working locally with the

140 2014 sustainability report



     methodological note

     the sustainability report as at 31 december 2014 hereinafter 2014 sustainability report of the terna group was
     prepared according to the grig4 guidelines and the update g4 sector disclosureelectric utilities issued in 2013
     by the global reporting initiative gri as in the last few years the report was approved by terna spas board of
     directors and subjected to specific auditing procedures the assurance report prepared by pricewaterhousecoopers is
     provided as an annex
     the grig4 guidelines were applied according to the core option
     the process of preparing the document involved identifying the significant aspects to report see the materiality paragraph
     below and presenting the performance achieved by the group in relation to such aspects and the sustainability targets
     the period of observation is the year 2014 all data refer to the financial year ending on 31 december 2014 at the
     descriptive level the significant changes occurring up to 20 march 2015 have also been indicated
     as part of its progressive adoption of the principles outlined by the international integrated reporting council iirc
     terna has published as was the case last year the integrated report coinciding with the 2014 report on operations
     in the annual financial report this report also contains numerous topics dealt with in this sustainability report the
     discussion of the aforementioned topics is the same in both reports except where further detail is required pursuant for
     example to specific requirements in the gri guidelines the sustainability issues included in the integrated report were
     chosen based on materiality considerations




     materiality

     the information and gri indicators to be included in this report so as to enable stakeholders to make a balanced
     assessment of the groups performance were chosen on the basis of a careful analysis of the informative objectives of the
     contents of the report and its pertinence to ternas activities and the interests of its stakeholders
     in 2013 terna launched a process of identification of relevant issues for the company and its stakeholders the analysis
     followed the principal of materiality as described in the grig4 standard and allowed for a materiality matrix to be prepared
     as well as a thematic tree topics grouped together with several levels of detail on the basis of the parameters of relevance
     for the company issues that reflect the significant economic social and environmental impacts of the organization and
     relevance for stakeholders issues that substantially affect stakeholders assessments and choices
     in 2014 the matrix was updated considering new information on relevant issues as well as their importance to stakeholders
     and for achieving corporate objectives in particular the following activities were undertaken
      updating the prioritisation of issues in terms of their impact on strategies in other words the potential for each
        topic to generate risks and opportunities for corporate objectives in the short medium and long term the update
        was prepared via the analysis of documentation relating to 2014 eg internal policies the development plan and
        appropriate consultations the strategic plan press reviews inhouse publication the sustainability plan bsc and
        sustainability rating agency questionnaires etc in order to give a more dynamic and forwardlooking take on the
        evaluation the evidence from the meetings carried out with company departments in 2013 has been included the
        relevance for terna was obtained by considering the two results for each topic
      updating the prioritisation of the issues for the relevance for stakeholders aspect the update was prepared via the
        analysis of documentation relating to 2014 eg the aeegsi strategic plan anie annual report agcm annual report
        assoelettrica report greenpeace report local and national press reviews evidence from terna interviews carried
        out as part of the new mapping of stakeholders the relevance for stakeholders aspect was also supplemented with
        the evidence from the meetings carried out with company departments in 2013 a qualitativequantitative model was
        subsequently developed which allows for the issues to be prioritised via three variables
         the relevance of the issue for every category of stakeholder
         	the priority of each category of stakeholder which considers the new mapping and the relevance of the stakeholders
          available from 2014
         	the number of categories of stakeholders interested in the topic
     after having validated the results obtained for the two dimensions the materiality matrix 2014 was calculated which
     highlights the relevant issues and their position in relation to the relevance for corporate strategies relevance for terna
     and to the relevance that the companys reference stakeholders attribute to them perceived relevance

 in order to clarify the relationship between the materiality matrix in which the ternas key priorities are found and the
handling of the g4 indicators and aspects in the sustainability report one or more terna key priorities of 2nd or 3rd
level has been attributed to each g4 indicator with the respective values for relevance for terna and relevance
for stakeholders the rating for each g4 indicator was then calculated and by grouping the indicators by aspect a
relevance evaluation for each g4 aspect was obtained
 this allowed for the g4 materiality matrices to be calculated for each grig4 information context economic
environmental and social which illustrate the position of the various aspects on the axes of relevance for terna and
relevance for stakeholders please see pages 82 99 120 and 132 lastly we note that the aspects relative to
management of the reporting mechanisms are not shown in the individual matrices but dealt with together in the relative
paragraph on page 58

142 2014 sustainability report



     structure of the report

     the chapter divisions in the report are the same as in previous years after the ternas profile and relations with
     stakeholders comes the standard division of the issues into four main sections corresponding to the triple bottom line 
     economic environmental and social  typical of sustainability reports preceded by the section on responsibility for the
     electric service which is specific to terna
     each chapter begins with an explanation of the managerial approach to the specific area this is followed by several
     thematic sections which are integrated into a single text giving the precise information required by the gri guidelines
     and the indepth analysis that terna considers important to provide in order to make the report easier to read the
     information regarding the gri indicators is signalled by the related code in the margin of the text next to the relevant
     passages or next to the title if the entire section is considered relevant
     the tables of indicators summarising the gri indicators and supplementing them with others complete the report for
     the meaning of technical terms specific to the electricity industry see the glossary on the website wwwternait on the
     tools page using the following link wwwternaitdefaulthomesostenibilita2strumenti_sostenibilitaaspx




     scope and indicators

     the data and information in the 2014 sustainability report refer to the terna group that is to say the scope which
     includes terna spa and the companies that were consolidated in the consolidated financial statements for the year
     ending 31 december 2014 except  unless otherwise stated  the tamini group acquired by the subsidiary terna plus
     on the 20 may 2014 in accordance with the principle of materiality the data included in the sustainability report include
     all the companies with a significant impact on sustainability ie by size or rather the number of employees or by potential
     impact on the environment and society or rather the number of operationsactivities which took place during the year
     over which terna spa exercises control directly or indirectly that is to say for which it has the power to determine the
     financial and operational policies there are no relations with jointventures subsidiaries or leased businesses that could
     significantly influence the boundary or the comparability of the environmental and social data the groups work abroad
      including that of the montenegrin terna crna gora doo  did not involve operating activities for the whole of 2014 with
     significant external impacts eg activities involving construction infrastructure for this reason foreign activities have not
     been included unless otherwise stated in the calculation of the indicators published in this report
     the data were calculated precisely on the basis of the entries in the general accounting and ternas other information
     systems in the case of estimates in determining the indicators the procedure followed is stated
     all the gri indicators published are listed below in the grig4 content index which also includes any limitations relative
     to the requirements
     in comparing this report to that of 2013 the following should be noted
      the different definition of days not worked relative to injuries used to calculate the lostday rate indicator g4la6
        the days not worked related to injuries occurring in 2014 were considered together with any continued absence related
        to injuries occurring during the previous years following the criterion of annual accrual of days of absence this method
        was also adopted to recalculate the 2013 and 2012 lostday rates for this reason the data shown in the table differ
        from those published previously

                                                                                                            methodological note 143




comparative analysis of sustainability performance

convinced that a comparison of environmental social and governance performance is of interest not only to the
company itself but also to its stakeholders certain comparisons between ternas results and those of other companies
are included in the 2014 sustainability report as was the case in previous years for 2014 the comparisons were
focused on four indicators co2 emissions sf6 leakage incidence rate hours of training per capita provided to employees
and the turnover rate on termination the reduction of the indicators for the comparative analysis compared with previous
years is mainly derived from the updating of the materiality matrix which gives less relevance to the excluded issues
water consumption waste production and the gender pay gap
listed below are the main criteria adopted in the analysis as an introduction to the reading and interpretation of the
comparisons of individual indicators in the report
 three panels of companies were identified the first was composed of the european transmission system operators
   and the major noneuropean operators in terms of kilometres of lines managed the second multisectoral in nature
   is made up of large italian companies the 40 listed companies of the ftsemib at 21 january 2015 the third formed
   by the best international performers in the electric utilities  elc sector identified by the robecosam sustainability
   rating agency and included in the dow jones sustainability world index of september 2014 the purpose of the three
   panels is to guarantee also relative to the type of indicator reviewed a comparison between companies with the same
   operational characteristics an italian comparison and a comparison with top international performers in the same
   sector
 the companies considered from among those in the three panels were those which publicise the information necessary
   for comparisons either on their websites through the sustainability report even if not prepared following the gri
   guidelines or through other documentation hse report financial report etc this led to a reduction in the sample
   compared to the number of companies in the starting panel
 the comparative analysis entails reference to 2013 data since the comparisons were drafted when the 2014 reports
   were still being prepared as was the case for terna
it must be noted that despite the exclusion of data which were explicitly not consistent in numerous cases doubts
remain as to the actual comparability between companies especially in instances where significant discrepancies exist
between the declared data of some companies and the average value of the reference group
in the co2 emissions comparison the data are expressed as physical quantities in absolute terms and therefore show very
different levels depending on the type of production activity and the size of the company in this case the comparison
provides information on the varying significance of the environmental aspects being considered for the individual
companies but does not fulfil the task of making the performance comparable
for further details please see the terna website where the comparisons regarding water consumption waste production
and the gender pay gap are also published and the note comparing sustainability performance ternas experience in
the study beyond the financial figures companies and collective wellbeing drafted by the csr manager network and
istat and available on their respective websites

      in 2014 there was an 185 increase in sf6 leakages compared to 2013 this was caused by the accident that occurred in an operational transmission
      area during which 7841 kg of sf6 was dispersed into the atmosphere net of this accident the sf6 leakage was equal to 21875 and the percentage
      of the leakage out of the total was 041 confirming the downward trend compared with the previous year
2
      conversion of direct energy consumption and sf6 sulphur hexafluoride leaks to equivalent co2 emissions is done using the parameters indicated in the
      greenhouse gas protocol ghg initiative and in particular the emission factors indicated in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental
      panel on climate change ipcc indirect consumption of electricity is converted taking into account the proportion of thermoelectric production in the
      total italian electricity production for 2014 the reference for the division of the production mix is the monthly report on the electric system with the
      results for december 2014 available on the website wwwternait
3
      the increase in direct emissions in 2014 was due mainly to the figure for sf6 leaks up by 185 compared with 2013 the figure was affected by the
      accident that occurred in an operational transmission area during which 17877 tonnes of co2 equivalent were dispersed into the atmosphere net of
      this accident ternas direct emissions were equal to 57403 tonnes confirming the downward trend compared with the previous year
4
      since 2014 in order to evaluate co2 deriving from the air travel of employees the conversion factors indicated by the greenhouse gas protocol initiative have been
      used unlike in previous years the parameters indicated in the icao international civil aviation organization carbon emissions methodology have been used
5
      the figure is calculated on the basis of the values provided by car manufacturers in logbooks and on the mileage estimates of said vehicles the value
      expressed in the table represents 662 of the company fleet for 2014 in 2013 it referred to 627 of the fleet and in 2012 59

      the table shows the vehicles in the terna fleet which in the period in question filled up at least once as recorded on the fuel card only operating
      vehicles are considered for information on the consumption of the company fleet see the following fuel consumption tables

                the outflows inflows for women and men show the ratio of employees divided by gender who left joined in the year to total employees divided by
                gender at 31 december of the previous year
          2
                the figure is obtained from the ratio between promotions to junior executive that occurred during the year and employees categorised as whitecollar
                workers in the previous year calculated by gender promotions from bluecollar worker to whitecollar worker and from junior executive to senior
                executive were not considered because the number was not significant on an annual basis
          3
                the figure is the result of the percentage ratio between the annual basic pay for women for the different grades and the annual basic pay for men for the
                same grades the figure was not calculated for bluecollar workers because there are no women in that category
          4
                the figure is the result of the percentage ratio between the total annual remuneration for women for the different grades and the total annual remuneration
                for men for the same grades the total remuneration includes besides basic pay production bonuses the different types of incentives and the value of
                the benefits received over the year

      this is the number of injuries with at least one days abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during the year and multiplied
      by 200000 corresponding to 50 working weeks x 40 hours x 100 employees to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator was also
      calculated using a multiplication factor of 1000000 instead of 200000 consequently obtaining an injury rate five times that of the ilo with this
      calculation method the injury rate came out at 63 in 2014 71 in 2013 and 88 in 2012
2
      this is the ratio between the days not worked owing to injury and hours worked in the year multiplied by 200000 days not worked are calendar days
      counted from when the injury occurred to facilitate comparison with other sources this indicator was also calculated using a multiplication factor of
      1000 with this calculation method the lostday rate came out at 02 in 2014 03 in 2013 and 03 in 2012 to calculate the lostday rate the days
      not worked related to injuries occurring in 2014 were considered together with any continued absence related to injuries occurring during the previous
      years following the criterion of annual accrual of days of absence this method was also adopted to recalculate the 2013 and 2012 rates for this
      reason the data shown in the table differ from those published previously
3
      this is the total number of cases of occupational disease divided by the hours worked in the year multiplied by 200000 no hours of absence were
      ascribable to occupational disease because the type of activities carried out by terna does not entail any work associated  on the basis of the official
      legal tables  with the possible onset of occupational diseases ternas occupational disease rate must therefore be considered to be always zero

      this is the number of injuries with at least one days abstention from work divided by the number of hours worked during the year and multiplied

      calculated using a multiplication factor of 1000000 instead of 200000 consequently obtaining an injury rate five times that of the ilo with this
      calculation method the injury rate came out at 38 in 2014 29 in 2013 and 31 in 2012
