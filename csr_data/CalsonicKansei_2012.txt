                                              we have already calculated the internal environmental burden per unit for each of the products we make at our
                                              manufacturing plants and we have entered this information into databases as lca data for selfmanufactured products
                                              lca data are also calculated for selected target vehicle types
                                              in 2006 we started the product environmental indicator wg to assess methods for evaluating the environmental
                                              aspect of products during the product development process by reviewing the usage of lca indicators for example and
                                              utilizing the results in 2007 we built a co2 emissionscomputing system to calculate the co2 emission amounts
                                              generated during the manufacturing process for each of our products

    7 eﬀorts to manage chemical substances
     substances that could impact the environment are used in some products and for the manufacture of
 items designed to improve the quality of these products therefore there are concerns that these substances
 could have a signiﬁcant impact on the environment during the manufacture and use of these products and
 also when they are discarded
     global awareness of the environment is now increasing and more requests to reducestop using these
 substances are coming in every year both from home and abroad
     in response we are promoting the responsible management of chemical substances environmentally
 hazardous substances by adhering to the laws and regulations of each country and by responding promptly
 to our customers requests


 1 basic concepts
     to achieve responsible risk management for products  manufacturing process  purchased materials and processed
     materials  we adhere to the following fundamental principles use as few harmful chemicals as possible  eliminate as
     many harmful substances as possible and change to alternatives and properly manage harmful chemicals if they have
     to be used

      management of pcb
      appropriate management regulations have been implemented for electrical devices that include pcbs as waste products
      for special management in accordance with the law pcbs are also scheduled for prompt disposal which has already
      started at some bases


      thorough water quality management
       we have set our voluntary management targets 80 of the regulatory value and are conducting stricter management
       than the law requires


      thorough air quality management
      we have ﬁnished switching from heavy oil a fuel to special heavy oil a fuel containing only 10 of the sulfur content

     the calsonic kansei group is quantitatively evaluating the environmental burden output resulting from
its industrial operations and striving to reduce this burden by gaining a comprehensive understanding of the
impact of all operations
     from the viewpoint of global warming we promote reduced carbon emissions and reduced emissions per
unit and from the viewpoint of the eﬀective use of resources we promote 100 reuse of those resources 
creating zero waste so that our factories can operate in balance with the environment
     furthermore our concerted eﬀorts and achievements regarding the electric power usage restriction
ordinance adopted in the summer of 2011 which set various restraints in place greatly surpassed the
original targets and promoted our energy management goals
