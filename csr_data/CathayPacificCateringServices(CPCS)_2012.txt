world standards about sustainable seafood meanwhile our team continues to
recommend our customers to change from wild catch seafood to farmed
sources

environmental products by phase we have replaced our top used paper
materials such as hand paper towel printed matters and paper with fsc paper
our business name cards used to be made up of 70 fsc paper is now
printed on 100 fsc paper the team also started to source environmentally
friendly plastic products such as biodegradable plastic bag and biodegradable
plastic wrapping film


                                         29

to reduce carbon footprint we aim to source more locally rather than from
overseas

           clean air charter  the commitment of cpcs


1 operate by a recognised world class standard on emission of air pollutants
   even if it is not required to do so here
   commitment of cpcs diesel used by highloaders and boilers are the
   major sources of direct emissions produced by cpcs             currently all the
   new highloaders purchased comply with euro 4 standard                 all trucks
   undergo regular checks to ensure the engine is operating normally to
   prevent incomplete burning of fuel emissions from cpcss boiler are
   monitored by tests to ensure the combustion is normal cpcs only uses
   ultralow sulphur diesel


2 use continuous emission monitors cems at significant sources
   commitment of cpcs the exhaust fumes of highloaders are being
   checked during maintenance


3 publish information on energy and fuel use as well as total emissions of air
   pollutants annually and timely if emissions are significant
   commitment of cpcs our fuel consumption is reported in one of the
   data that is being collected in cpcs including our sister companies in our
   current ehs data collection regime


4 undertake to adopt energyefficient measures in their operations
   commitment of cpcs a number of projects have been done to reduce
   the energy as well as fuel needed for our operations for example


    a   energy efficient light tubes are being used to reduce the use of
         electricity ie indirect emission

                                         32

    b   demand control ventilation system installed in canteen to adjust the
         air con according to people traffic to reduce electricity consumption
    c   steam recovery system installed to recover unused steam to preheat
         water to reduce diesel consumption
    d   reflective jackets installed in light box to reduce the number of light
         tubes needed and thus to reducing the use of electricity


5 identify and encourage business measures to be taken on days when air
   pollution is high
   commitment of cpcs we have found this technically challenging to
   implement as cpcs has no control on the flight schedule and thus
   production of inflight meals but cpcs will try every single effort to reduce
   emissions at all times


6 share air quality of business with others
   commitment of cpcs we will share this information through cpcs
   annual environmental report
