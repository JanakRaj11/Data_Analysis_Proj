annual report 2015


triodos bank produces a printed audited version of the
annual report we do this because some of our stakeholders
want to read the report in this format and because we are
legally required to provide the annual report as a discrete
single document


however we have chosen to put more energy into producing
the annual report online the online annual report includes
content that is not in this document from films highlighting
the extraordinary work of the sustainable enterprises we
finance and an interview with our ceo to an extended chapter
about triodos banks impact


we believe the online annual report provides a more complete
picture of our performance and our aspirations for the future
and many more people choose to view it than read the report
in print it has also allowed us to reduce the number of printed
copies of the report we produce each year


however you choose to read or view the annual report we
hope it provides you with a rich picture of triodos banks
valuesbased mission strategy and impact in the wider world
we appreciate your feedback so please contact us via the tell

although triodos bank generally complies with the              law to other personal conflicts of interest of
principles and best practices of the code it has opted        executive board members as defined in best practice
to consciously differ from it in several specific              ii32 sub i and ii of the code the provisions of the
instances                                                     code are applicable

the first deviation relates to voting rights on shares         the fifth instance relates to the fact that the
and appointments to secure the continuity of triodos          supervisory board of triodos bank does not have
banks mission and objectives depository receipt              separate nomination and remuneration committees
holders cannot exercise voting rights on the                   instead it operates an integrated nomination and
underlying shares instead these rights are exercised          compensation committee this is done for practical
by saat for the same reason depository receipt               reasons given triodos banks relatively modest size
holders cannot make recommendations for
appointments of members of the board of saat and               triodos bank also differs from the codes best practice
former executive board or supervisory board                    when submitting all proposals to the general meeting
members of the bank can be appointed as members                for material amendments to the articles of association
of the board of saat                                          as separate agenda items for practical reasons
                                                               triodos bank wants to retain the possibility at the
the second instance relates to the term of office of           discretion of the executive board and the supervisory
executive board members this term is not limited to           board to submit a proposal for multiple amendments
a period of four years because triodos bank feels that         to the articles of association as one single agenda item
this would not serve the long term development of the          when there is a strong degree of interrelatedness
organisation                                                  between these proposed amendments

triodos bank also differs from the best practice in the        finally as it does not have any share plans or option
code that states that a person may be appointed to the         schemes in place several code provisions regarding
supervisory board for a maximum of three fouryear            executive remuneration do not apply to triodos bank
terms its articles of association allow the general           the total costs for executive remuneration which
meeting to reappoint a member of the supervisory              primarily consist of wages and pension elements are

international remuneration and nomination policy
the international remuneration  nomination policy is based on the principle of human dignity and aims to
enhance social coherence within the organisation the policy incorporates the cebs guidelines on


                                                        84

remuneration policies and practices and the regulation of de nederlandsche bank on sound remuneration
policies in our view remuneration enables coworkers to earn a decent living and to contribute to the
organisation and society at large triodos bank believes in the intrinsic motivation of its coworkers to
contribute to our mission and to work according to our corporate values the richness of the contribution of
each coworker cannot be translated into a linear financial incentive triodos bank operates in the financial
sector therefore its remuneration practice needs to be within the scope of what is expected in the financial
sector it allows for a healthy in and outflow of coworkers at the same time triodos bank maintains a
relatively low ratio between the lower and higher level of salaries paid variable components are modest and
discretionary this all contributes to a strong sense of being jointly responsible for realising the mission of
triodos bank

this international remuneration and nomination policy has been revised in 2015 and was approved by the
supervisory board on 5 november 2015

the remuneration paid to the members of the executive board is set by the supervisory board upon advice of
the nomination and compensation committee the basic principles of the triodos bank remuneration system
are taken into account

the remuneration paid to supervisory board members and members of the foundation for the administration of
triodos bank shares saat board is set at the annual general meeting of shareholders and the annual meeting
of depository receipt holders respectively whereby modest remuneration is offered so that sufficient qualified
members can be attracted and retained

key elements of triodos banks international remuneration and nomination policy are
 triodos bank continues not to offer bonus or share option schemes to either members of the executive board
the supervisory board the board of saat or coworkers financial incentives are not considered an appropriate
way to motivate and reward coworkers in a valuesbased bank in addition sustainability is by its very nature
the result of a combined effort by team members aimed at both the short and long term
 triodos bank may provide additional individual tokens of appreciation to coworkers to a maximum of one
months salary with a maximum of eur 10000 gross a year these contributions are for extraordinary
achievements and are at the discretion of management after consultation with human resources such a token
is not based on preset targets and always offered in retrospect the tokens of appreciation are subject to claw
back arrangements the members of the executive board are excluded from these awards
 an annual collective token of appreciation can be paid for the overall achievements and contribution of all co
workers this very modest amount is the same for all coworkers with a maximum of  500 for each coworker
this can be paid in cash or in triodos bank nv depository receipts for 2015 a collective endofyear token of
appreciation of eur 500 was awarded this amount is equal for all coworkers whether they work fulltime or
part time and prorata if not in service throughout the whole year
 the factor by which the maximum salary in the lowest scale and the maximum salary for senior management
differs will be monitored carefully in each country the ratio in the netherlands was 98 in 2015 it was 96
in 2014 to ensure the discrepancy between the highest and lowest remunerated coworkers is not excessive
 severance payments should be modest and should never reward failure or misconduct severance payments
to members of the executive board do not exceed one years salary

the leverage ratio is calculated using the transitional definition of the tier 1 capital

the leverage ratio is 84 2014 88 using the fully phasedin definition of the tier 1 capital


management of excessive leverage
the risk of excessive leverage is managed inclusively in our capital management we aim for a strong capital
base reducing this risk

at the end of 2015 the leverage ratio is 84 2014 88 the leverage ratio was mainly affected by growth of
the onbalance positions and growth of equity the effect of the implementation of the capital requirements
regulation had a limited effect on the leverage ratio therefore the outcome is stable

risk management



purpose and organisation

objective
the aim of triodos banks risk management activities is to ensure the long term resilience of the business these
activities create an environment in which triodos bank can pursue its mission to its fullest potential in a safe
way risk management provides the structural means to identify prioritise and manage the risks inherent in its
business activities the intention is to embed risk management in such a way that it fits the complexity and size
of the organisation and is designed to also allow future growth in order to ensure that such an environment can
exist and prosper a risk governance framework has been put in place which underpins the risk processes

the three lines of defense
triodos bank manages its business using a three lines of defense model this approach ensures that each co
worker is fully aware of their responsibilities in the management of risk irrespective of whether their role is in a
commercial policymaking or control function the model ensures that responsibilities are properly aligned and
makes clear that all coworkers have a role to play in managing risk

first line functions are triodos banks branches business units and departments which are responsible for
managing the risks of their operations second line functions are located in the bank branches business units
and departments and ensure that risks are appropriately identified and managed second line functions are
also established at the head office they create and maintain the corporate risk governance framework and
the policies and procedures which provide the boundaries for the local and consolidated business activities

the third line of defense is the internal audit function providing independent and objective assurance of triodos
banks corporate governance internal controls compliance and risk management systems this includes the
effectiveness and efficiency of the internal controls in the first and second lines of defense

risk organisation
in light of triodos banks growth the impact of all new regulations and the increased attention of supervisory
authorities triodos bank has made an important step up in its risk management organisation during the past
years the director risk and compliance cro is taking full responsibility for all the second line risk
management and compliance activities and reports directly to the chief financial officer and its activities are
supervised by the audit and risk committee of the supervisory board

the structure of the risk organisation meets banking industry standards and covers all relevant risks for triodos
bank within the three following risk categories enterprise risks financial risks and nonfinancial risks each
risk type covers a number of risk categories see diagram on the next page




                                                        114

the current governance structure of triodos bank facilitates the executive board to delegate decisionmaking
authority to the following risk committees at a central level
 for financial risk the central credit committee has authority to take decisions on credit risks both on an
individual debtor level and on a credit portfolio level the asset  liability committee has authority to decide on
market risks and liquidity risk
 for nonfinancial risk the nonfinancial risk committee has authority to decide on operational and
compliance risk matters this committee also functions as the product approval committee for new products
and
 for enterprise risk the enterprise risk committee has authority to decide on strategic business and
reputational risk issues




                                                        115

each committee is chaired by an executive board member to ensure consistent decision making on material
risks within triodos banks wider strategy

branches also have a decisionmaking committee for their lending activities the local credit committee this
local credit committee decides on loans under the responsibility of the local managing director within delegated
credit approval limits this committee also monitors the credit risks of the local credit portfolio and monitors
alignment with relevant credit risk policies

the supervisory boards audit and risk committee supervises the activities of the executive board with respect
to the operation and adequacy of internal risk management and control systems the cro reports to the
executive board and has an escalation line to the chair of the audit  risk committee that supports the
independency of the risk control function as countervailing power to the business


enterprise risk
the enterprise risk discipline synthesises all the risks using input from all risk areas and performs analyses to
determine at a strategic level which larger trends can potentially influence triodos banks risk profile triodos
bank manages enterprise risk through a risk management cycle performing strategic risk assessments
determining the risk appetite assessing capital and liquidity requirements and monitoring the risk profile
through periodic enterprise risk management reporting

strategic risk
strategic risks are those that potentially have the most impact on an organisations ability to execute its
strategies and achieve its business objectives therefore strategic risk assessments are performed at
executive board level for triodos bank as a whole and at managing director level for each business unit every
three years with an annual update

triodos bank considers its basic banking model to have a low risk profile as a traditional retail bank it earns its
income from the transformation of interest and liquidity maturity of money and taking credit risks volume is an
important factor in generating a healthy income in addition the following elements play an important role the
balancing of assets and liabilities the capacity to set an adequate price for those assets and liabilities and
other banking services cost control is also crucial to maintaining operational profit

strategic risks need to be carefully managed to realise integrated financial and missiondriven objectives

the corporate and local risk sensitivities are used to determine scenarios that are used to test triodos banks
capital liquidity profitability and operational stability during the year




                                                         116

risk appetite
a risk appetite process is implemented across triodos bank to align its risk profile with the willingness to take
risk in delivering its business objectives the risk appetite statement reflects the actual implementation of the
risk appetite framework it is updated yearly and is approved by the supervisory board upon advise by the
audit and risk committee the concept of risk appetite and the link to the strategy and business objectives is
illustrated below

overview of risk capacity risk appetite risk limits and the relationship with triodos banks risk profile




triodos bank uses a set of indicators and limits to measure and assess the level of risk appetite and risk profile
of the organisation the risk limits determined at corporate level are translated into a localised limit structure
for each branch this local limit structure or cascaded limits structure is being developed for all risk types

the risk appetite is based on three objectives that fit with triodos corporate goals and guarantee a sustainable
banking model they are to 1 protect identity and reputation 2 maintain healthy balance sheet relations and
3 maintain stable growth

recovery
the recovery plan specifies measures triodos bank can take in order to survive a severe crisis that impacts its
capital position liquidity profitability and operational stability the aim of a recovery plan is to be prepared for a
crisis and therefore to lower the probability of the organisation defaulting it also aims to identify and quantify
the effectiveness of corrective measures which are taken in different scenarios




                                                          117

enterprise risk reporting
every risk discipline reports on a monthly basis eg non financial risk report alm report and business
banking loan report or on a quarterly basis eg compliance report these reports are discussed in
corresponding committees and correction measures are taken whenever needed on a quarterly basis they are
integrated in the enterprise risk management erm report which provides insights into the triodos bank risk
profile in relation to its accepted risk appetite the objective of the erm report is to create a single point of
reference for all risk related activities within triodos bank the erm report also provides insights into specific
risk themes and provides an integrated picture of risk at corporate level this report is discussed in the
enterprise risk committee and shared with the audit and risk committee and supervisory board

business risk
triodos bank defines business risk as the risk caused by changes in external factors like competitive
relationships stakeholders reputation and business climate strategic risk is caused by internal factors within
the organisation business risk arises outside of the organisation given that both risks can affect the
organisations ability to achieve its overall objectives they are managed together as described under strategic
risk

reputational risk
triodos bank defines reputational risk as the risk that its market position deteriorates due to a negative
perception among customers counterparties shareholders andor regulatory authorities triodos bank
safeguards reputational risk in other risk disciplines as in most cases it is a consequence of other risk events
happening it also works with a transparent and stable business model with solid ratios mitigating this risk

reputational risk has a special dimension for triodos bank which relates to its mission and values and are
essential to achieving its objectives in this sense the exposure of triodos bank to reputational risk depends on
the ability of management and coworkers to act consciously in accordance with the mission and values for
this reason triodos bank has a very proactive human resources approach aimed to ensure the connection of all
coworkers with the mission and values in addition triodos bank actively manages its engagement with the
public and its clients for example via an online social media policy and management of complaints


financial risk
financial risk is an umbrella term for multiple types of risk associated with financing the balance sheet to
manage this financial risk is subdivided in three categories credit risk market risk and liquidity risk

credit risk

credit risk loan book
triodos bank manages its credit risk at a client and at a portfolio level it operates within a predefined set of
criteria for accepting credits credits are extended within the target markets and lending strategy in accordance
with triodos banks mission and expertise before accepting a credit facility triodos bank makes an assessment
of the customers risk profile cash flows available collateral and the requested transaction including an
assessment of the integrity and reputation of the borrowers or counterparty compliance analysis with triodos
lending criteria is an integral part of each credit proposal


                                                       118

obligor risk
an obligor is a single legal entity that commits to the terms and conditions of a loan agreement the obligor is
thoroughly analysed from meeting triodos banks lending criteria to its capacity to repay a loan the risk related
to the obligor is that it fails to meet its contractual obligations obligors are rated through an internal rating
methodology system

a thorough assessment of each obligor and the structure of their loan is made before any loan is provided a
review of approved credit is made once a year at a minimum to assess the evolution of the clients capacity to
meet its obligations the high quality of securities collateral against outstanding loans reduces credit risk
principal collateral are for example mortgage registrations for business or private properties securities from
public authorities companies or private individuals and rights of lien on movables such as office equipment
inventories receivables andor contracts for projects

triodos bank aims to finance specific projects and objects that are in line with the banks mission when
financing a project the bank has a pledge on the underlying contracts for the financing of objects the bank
will take a pledge or mortgage on the specific object the bank applies haircuts in all cases on the market
value the level of this haircut will depend on the marketability of the asset in a negative scenario this allows
triodos bank to make a proper assessment of the overall risk of the loan and the value of the asset in case of a
downturn the value of the collateral is reviewed on a yearly basis and for large loans with a mortgage an
external valuation by an expert will be requested at a minimum every three years

triodos bank has an early warning system that helps identify problem loans early to allow for more available
options and remedial measures once a loan is identified as being in default unlikelyness to pay or overdue
payments beyond 90 days it is managed under a dedicated remedial process with a focus on full recovery

group exposures
the risk related to a group is that if one obligor fails to meet its contractual obligations so will the remaining
obligors within the group  a group is defined as two or more obligors that are interrelated in such a way that
they are considered as a single risk

each obligor of the group and the group as a whole are analysed on all aspects from meeting triodos banks
lending criteria and to their capacity to repay the loan

concentration risk loan book
loans are provided to businesses and projects that contribute to achieving triodos banks mission given that
this involves a small number of sustainable sectors a certain level of sector concentration is inherent to the
loan portfolio concentration in the existing sectors is acceptable as triodos bank has considerable expertise in
these sectors and actively invests in further increasing its knowledge

a diversified credit risk portfolio is the result of assets spread over many debtors sectors and geographies that
are not interrelated in order to manage concentration risks and face an economic downturn with confidence
triodos bank maintains a set of limits it measures and limits the following concentration risks in its lending
activities obligor exposures group exposures top 20 exposures excluding central and lower government
exposures government exposures exposures at sector per country mortgage exposures and country
exposures



                                                         119

besides lending activities triodos bank has established limits related to the investment portfolio concerning
central banks governments supranational institutions and banks and financial institutions these limits are
derived from the risk appetite framework and aim to keep concentration risk at an acceptable level

from a regulatory perspective single exposures to a debtor or a group may never exceed 25 of the actual own
funds loans in excess of 10 of the actual own funds require special reporting to the supervisory authority

triodos bank has in its loanbook no loans to a debtor or group exceeding 10 of the actual own funds limits
of the investment portfolio are described in the relevant chapters

sector concentrations
triodos bank is active in well defined sectors where it has extensive expertise and which are in line with its
mission it has set limits on sectors based on actual own funds at group and branch level sector studies have
shown relatively low correlations of risk drivers in sectors that triodos bank finances in multiple countries

at group level triodos bank divides the sector concentration limits in different levels specific limits for each
sector per country are set by the executive board within these levels taking into account the specific risks of
each sector and country

larger sectors are strategic for triodos bank these are well distributed across branches and countries and
have an overall low risk profile that justifies a higher consolidated concentration sector analyses are performed
on an annual basis and are presented to the central credit committee to be able to respond swiftly to
developments that may affect the risk profile of the portfolio central credit risk can request sector updates at
shorter intervals if there is a change to a sector risk profile

sector limits are approved on the basis of thorough annual sector analyses demonstrating an in depth
knowledge of the sector and triodos banks track record

eus 202020 targets have been set for increasing the share of renewables and reducing co2 missions by the
year 2020 across the eu co2 emissions are to be reduced by 20 of the 1990 level energy demand is to be cut
by 20 and renewables are to cover 20 of the total consumption triodos bank has a diversified renewable
energy portfolio in terms of geography and technology and derives comfort as to the future of this sector in view
of the ambitious eu targets

country concentrations
triodos bank is a european bank acting under the european banking directive since 1993 with branches in five
countries the netherlands belgium united kingdom spain and germany and with additional exposures
amongst others in france and ireland

triodos bank does not set any country limits for the countries it operates in as long as these countries have a
credit rating of aa or better specific limits are defined for countries with a credit rating of a or lower




                                                         120

bad debts and loan loss provisions
all business loans in the portfolio are periodically reviewed on an individual basis their frequency depends on
the debtors creditworthiness the degree of market exposure and the market in which the debtor operates
private loans are reviewed at portfolio level and on individual basis if appropriate the credit committee of a
branch discusses and if necessary takes action with respect to overdue payments from debtors if there is any
doubt regarding the continuity of the debtors core operations andor a debtor fails to settle agreed interest and
repayment instalments for a prolonged period this debtor falls under the category of doubtful debtors and will
be managed intensively

provisions for loan losses are taken for doubtful debtors at an individual level based on the difference between
the total amount of the debtors outstanding liability to triodos bank and the future expected cash flows
discounted at the original effective interest rate of the contract these individual provisions include provisions
for concessions or refinancing given to debtors who face financial difficulties they are only granted to the
debtor in question in order to overcome their difficulties in these exceptional circumstances these are
described as forbearance measures

a general provision has been taken for incurred but not reported bad debts the ibnr to cover the time lag
between the event that prompts the debt to qualify as doubtful and the moment that fact is known to triodos
bank this is a generic provision and is based on statistics triodos bank applies a fraction of the expected loss
to calculate the ibnr in 2015 this fraction has been revieved against the banks portfolio experience and
broader market practice this has resulted in an increase of the ibnr

in 2015 the net additions to the provision for doubtful debts as a percentage of the average loan portfolio was
016 2014 028 the total of provisions related to the outstanding credits is 13 2014 16 as at the end
of the year

the credit risk in the loan portfolio is reported each month to the central credit committee and quarterly to the
audit and risk committee

bad debts and past due receivables
the following tables provide an overview of the bad debts and past due receivables per sector and country

bad debts are impaired loans that triodos bank expects will not be fully repaid in accordance with the original
loan contract provisions for loan losses are taken for doubtful debtors based on the difference between the
total amount of the debtors outstanding liability to triodos bank and future expected cash flows discounted at
the original effective interest rate of the contract past due receivables in these tables are loans overdue in
excess of 90 days

comprised of government bonds and government guaranteed bonds triodos bank also invests in a limited
number of other types of high grade bonds issued by european local governments in countries where triodos
bank has a branch european supranational organisations eg european investment bank and financial
institutions

there are no regulatory restrictions to exposures on governments triodos bank sets limits based on the country
risk

has a credit risk weight of 0 triodos bank has set limits to avoid concentration risk in exposures on
supranational organisations

exceptions can occur when the capacity of selected banks in a country is considered not sufficient to place
triodos banks liquidities using a certain maximum concentration per individual bank in such cases deposit
notice periods will not exceed three months all counterparty limits for banks are set by the central credit
committee

branches place excess liquidity with the countrys central banks minimum reserve requirements and deposit
facility there are no regulatory restrictions on exposures to central banks

the capital requirements regulation large exposures regime limits the maximum exposure to a single bank at
25 of its actual own funds to avoid the interbank exposure exceeding the regulatory maximum triodos bank

adapted to the external rating of the counterparty and also deposits on banks are limited to a maximum
maturity of one year

credit risk related to derivatives
triodos bank has exposure to credit risk resulting from outstanding foreign exchange fx contracts spot
forward and swap transactions with funds managed by triodos investment management triodos bank services
these funds by providing hedges for the foreign exchange risk of these funds investments the risk is mitigated
via the means of foreign exchange forward and swap contracts

the total exposure to credit risk resulting from outstanding fx deals per counterparty is the sum of
 positive markettomarket value of all contracts resulting in a claim by triodos bank
 the current market value is calculated per outstanding fx deal this is done by using current spot and forward
rates at an individual deal level all the individual outcomes are added resulting in a positive or negative market
value if the market value is positive for triodos bank it results in a counterparty credit exposure
 the potential positive change of that claim in the future resulting from changes in fx rates
 at deal level triodos bank calculates the potential change in exposure assuming a normal distribution of fx
rate changes based on historical data the expected fx rate is the latest forward rate at maturity obtained from
bloomberg the standard deviation is determined per currency pair based on historical observations
 minus existing collateral and netting agreements in place

a limit is set per counterparty based on the expected amount of outstanding fx transactions and the
corresponding expected exposure as calculated by the method above this limit is subject to the overall
counterparty limit triodos bank has per counterparty

any collateral needed for fx transactions is calculated and managed daily in the liquidity stress tests the
amount of collateral needed for fx transactions is stressed in order to calculate the potential impact on triodos
banks liquidity position

wrongway risk is the risk that the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that
counterparty triodos bank enters into fx deals with triodos investment funds and these deals are hedged by deals
with a few banks the fx deals with the triodos investment funds do not cause wrongway risk as these fx deals
hedge the fx risk of the underlying assets of the investment funds in addition the wrongway risk of transactions
with banks is mitigated by only using banks with sufficient credit ratings and by collateral agreements in place

movements in foreign exchange rates triodos banks base currency is the euro the uk branch balance sheet
and profit and loss account are denominated in sterling gbp exchange rate differences arising from
translating the uk branch balance sheet to euros are accounted for as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign
business unit and are taken directly to shareholders equity in the statutory reserve for conversion differences
insofar as the hedge is effective

triodos bank aims to avoid net currency positions with the exception of those arising from strategic
investments the term positions in foreign currencies mainly reflect the currency derivatives of triodos
investment funds which are nearly fully hedged

interest rate risk
interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk that earnings andor capital are negatively affected by
interest rate changes in the financial markets this risk is inherent to the traditional banking business and is a
source of profitability however this does not mean that profits depend solely on successfully taking interest
rate risk triodos bank wants to optimise its interest rate risk and focus on its core business  lending to and
investing in organisations that benefit people and the environment the objective is a modest risk appetite
which is reflected by the internal limits

risk monitoring
triodos bank uses various indicators to measure interest rate risk the interest rate risk position is monitored by
the asset and liability committee on a monthly basis and reported quarterly to the executive board interest
rate risk is managed with an interest rate risk model using guidelines and limits and by performing various
interest rate stress scenario analyses limits and assumptions are decided upon by the asset and liability
committee taking into account triodos banks risk appetite the suitability and appropriateness of the limits are
assessed on an annual basis the asset and liability committee will reevaluate the suitability and
appropriateness of the limits if triodos bank introduces new products that materially alter its interest rate risk
exposure or if market conditions change in ways that materially alter its exposure to interest rate risk

key risk indicators
 earnings at risk a short term indicator which shows the effect of an interest rate shock of plus or minus 2
200 basis points on triodos banks interest income this is measured over a one year and a two year period
 economic value of equity at risk a long term indicator which represents the change of the economic value of
equity which is the net present value of the future cash flows of all assets and liabilities in the event of an
interest rate shock of plus or minus 2 200 basis points
 outlier criterion the economic value of equity at risk expressed as a percentage of actual own funds
 modified duration of equity an indicator that expresses the sensitivity of the economic value of equity in the
event of interest rate changes

assumptions
the interest rate risk depends on client behaviour for some products behavioural models are used to assess
these products as a result triodos bank uses both expert judgement and statistical modelling to predict
repricing in various interest rate scenarios

the level of interest rate risk in savings and current accounts or nonmaturing deposits is difficult to quantify
in practice since these accounts typically have variable interest rates and no fixed maturity triodos bank may
decide to change rates at any point if it is prompted to do so by changes in market interest rates equally
clients may also withdraw their funds at any point in practice however rates are not changed very frequently
and clients are unlikely to withdraw all their funds instantly triodos bank uses a cash flow based model to
analyse interest rate risk in nonmaturing deposits the objective of this model is to forecast the future outflow
of the nonmaturing deposits and their sensitivities to market conditions

for loans interest rate risk also depends on client prepayment behaviour until recently the volume of
prepayments was not material and client behaviour was not taken into account in assessing interest rate risk
more recently due to the lower interest rate environment prepayments are increasing therefore behavioural
assumptions have been developed in the risk model and the level of prepayments will be monitored



                                                        127

risk mitigation
triodos bank is able to steer the volume and interest rate terms of client assets and liabilities in order to
maintain the triodos banks interest rate risk exposure within desired limits however changes in client rates
and terms will not be made to the extent that they would materially impair triodos banks customer service
market position profitability capital adequacy and reasonable customer expectations triodos bank also
manages the duration of liquid marketable investments to maintain its interest rate risk exposure if necessary
triodos bank will use interest rate swap contracts in order to maintain its interest rate risk exposure within
defined limits

the calculations for these indicators are based on interest rate maturities however saving and current
accounts have a nondefined interest maturity a quantitative assessment of the interest rate sensitivity of
triodos banks saving accounts and current accounts has been executed the outcome of this assessment is
used in the calculations for interest rate risk

the model used for the interest rate risk management of savings and current accounts predicts future volumes
and interest rates based on historical data taking into consideration the statistical significance of that data
the model combines the relationship between client interest rates and market interest rates and outflow
predictions

nottes
no

only interest bearing assets and liabilities are reported in this table which results in differences with the
balance sheet figures

interest bearing securities and subordinated liabilities are valued at redemption value including bond premium
and after deduction of discounts

for funds entrusted without a fixed interest rate term the outcome of the quantitative savings and current
account model as mentioned before is used

all other interestbearing assets and liabilities are reported as floating rates or are broken down in the maturity
calendar by their remaining contractual interest rate term

liquidity risk
liquidity risk refers to the risk that triodos bank is unable to fulfil its payment obligations to its customers and
counterparties at a particular point in time without incurring unacceptable losses

customers savings and deposits are attracted in order to finance triodos banks lending operations the
surplus is primarily placed with central banks credit institutions or invested in deposits and bonds triodos
bank has a strong liquidity position and is funded almost entirely by equity and deposits from private customers
and small and medium sized enterprises as a result triodos bank does not rely on funding from the wholesale
money and capital markets

risk assessment
a liquidity stress event has a low probability but can have a high impact scenario analysis stress testing is the
tool to quantify triodos banks vulnerability to liquidity stress events the liquidity contingency plan and the
recovery plan describe the main items that should be taken into account in managing the liquidity risk position
of triodos bank in a stressed situation this includes the indicators and triggers for this stressed situation
triodos bank regularly assesses its liquidity position based on stress scenarios in 2015 the results of these
stress tests were satisfactory

internal liquidity
the internal liquidity adequacy assessment process ilaap assesses triodos banks liquidity adequacy and
liquidity management during normal business activities and in times of stress this process is performed at
least once a year and is submitted to the dutch central bank as part of the supervisory review and evaluation
process the ilaap report is an internal document the goal of this report is to properly evaluate the liquidity
and funding risks and triodos banks corresponding liquidity levels and the quality of the liquidity management

risk mitigation
the liquidity buffer is the source of funds in case of liquidity needs it consists of investments with other banks
and investments in deposits and bonds the bond investments are divided into different liquidity classes the
optimal size and composition of the liquidity buffer is determined taking into account the risk appetite balance
sheet composition and expected development strategic plans and shortterm funding needs

risk monitoring
on a daily basis the total liquidity position of triodos bank is monitored on a weekly basis the detailed liquidity
position in total and at branch level is reported to the chief financial officer every month the liquidity ratios are
reported to the asset and liability committee

the liquidity coverage ratio lcr to ensure an adequate level of unencumbered highquality assets that can
be converted into cash to meet liquidity needs over a 30day time horizon under an liquidity stress scenario
specified by supervisors

the net stable funding ratio nsfr indicates the relationship between available longerterm stable funding
and required longerterm stable funding resulting from the liquidity profiles of assets and off balance sheet
items minimum nsfr standards will be set by 2018

asset encumbrance
assets can be differentiated between assets which are used to support funding or collateral needs
encumbered assets and assets which are available for potential funding needs unencumbered assets

nonfinancial risk
nonfinancials risk includes all the risks faced in triodos banks regular activities and processes that are not
categorised as enterprise or financial risk triodos bank has subdivided this into operational and compliance
risk monitoring these risks is particular important to ensure triodos bank can continue to offer quality financial
services to its stakeholders

operational risk
in the course of its normal business triodos bank runs operational risks these risks relate to losses triodos
bank could incur as a result of inadequate or failing internal processes systems human behaviour or external
events triodos bank limits these risks with clear policies reports and procedures for all business processes


                                                       134

the operational risk framework uses several tools and technologies to identify measure mitigate and monitor
risks on an operational tactical and strategic level during 2015 the operational risk framework was brought
further in line with the current scale and complexity of the organisation also the product approval policy was
revised and aligned with new legislation

operational risk management includes information security outsourcing and business continuity activities to
manage risks related to these subjects are executed under the responsibility of the chief operating officer in
line with the operational risk framework

the non financial risk committee and the product approval committee where all non financial risks aspects
are discussed including compliance and it risk meet on a monthly basis numerous control measures have
been improved and implemented in itsystems and embedded in procedures and work instructions coworker
training and involvement supports these improvements because as a learning organisation people are key to
successfully managing operational risks

triodos bank applies a method based on the basic indicator approach for the calculation of the minimum
capital requirements for operational risk

the operational risk framework follows the principles mentioned in the sound practices for the management
and supervision of operational risk these sound practices provide guidelines for the qualitative
implementation of operational risk management and are advised by the bank of international settlements
during 2015 no material losses occurred within triodos bank as a result of operational risk related events

compliance risk
triodos bank defines compliance risk as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions material financial loss or loss
to reputation that triodos bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws regulations rules
related selfregulatory standards and codes of conducts applicable to its banking activities internal policies
procedures and awareness activities are in place to guarantee that coworkers in all functions comply with
relevant laws and regulations

the compliance function independently monitors and challenges the extent to which triodos bank complies
with laws regulations and internal policies with an emphasis on customer due diligence antimoney
laundering treating customers fairly preventing and managing conflicts of interest data protection and the
integrity of coworkers compliance risks are identified assessed mitigated monitored and reported via a
compliance risk management cycle the central compliance department is part of the risk organisation
compliance officers are present in every business unit with a functional line towards the central compliance
department significant compliance risks are reported to the nonfinancial risk committee and to the
supervisory boards audit and risk committee on a quarterly basis the director risk and compliance reports to
a member of the executive board

there were no significant incidents in 2015 concerning compliance and integrity triodos bank was not involved
in material legal proceedings or sanctions associated with noncompliance with legislation or regulations in
terms of financial supervision corruption advertisements competition data protection or product liability
during the year




                                                        135

capital management
the objective of triodos banks capital strategy is to ensure its viability by
 maintaining sufficient capital to absorb current and future business losses even in extreme situations
stress
 adequately allocate capital to its business units and
 ensuring compliance to all applicable capital legislation and regulation at all times

capital adequacy and capital allocation
the total liability capital equity and subordinated loan is allocated to business units in proportion to the
economic capital based on their risk profile

triodos bank works with a rolling three year capital forecast the asset and liability committee monitors
triodos banks capital position and advises the executive board on the capital adequacy the asset and liability
committee also assesses whether available capital is sufficient to support current and future activities on a
monthly basis during 2015 available capital has been at sufficient levels at all times in 2015 new equity of net
eur 40 million was issued to finance triodos banks further growth in addition a retained portion of the 2015
profit will be added to the banks reserves

triodos bank issued a ten year subordinated loan with an original amount of eur 228 million on 12 july 2006
the contribution of subordinated debt to triodos banks tier 2 capital is not fixed during the last five remaining
years a subordinated loan is subject to an amortisation scheme the current remaining par amount of the
subordinated loan is eur 53 million due to buy backs in the last couple of years

at 31 december 2015 the contribution to triodos banks tier 2 capital is eur 06 million approx 10 of par
value

regulation
triodos bank takes fulfilling its regulatory obligations seriously it recognises that alongside the culture of an
organisation they can play an important role in helping to ensure banks operate appropriately

basel iii is a worldwide standard for regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector
developed by the basel committee on banking supervision basel iii has been transposed by the european
union into the capital requirements regulation and the capital requirements directive iv the capital
requirements regulation is directly applicable and the capital requirements directive iv should have been
transposed into local law by each of the members of the european union the capital requirements regulation
is directly applicable to triodos bank and so is the dutch implementation of the capital requirements directive
iv as triodos bank is formally domiciled in the netherlands

there is no difference in the scope of consolidation for accounting and for prudential reporting purposes there
is not any current or foreseen material practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of own funds or
repayment of liabilities among triodos bank and its consolidated companies

internal capital
the capital strategy of triodos bank is captured in its internal capital adequacy assessment process icaap
the icaap covers for example the measurement of risks requiring an adequate capital buffer stress testing
capital contingency and the allocation of available capital to the different triodos bank business units and

                                                         136

departments the icaap is regularly subjected to the supervisory review and evaluation process srep of the
dutch central bank

the actual capital position is stressed regularly based on a number of stress scenarios a capital contingency
process is set up for triodos bank in case of a potential shortfall in available capital which can be a threat to
its solvency for this purpose the recovery plan contains measures for restoring its solvency by reducing risks
andor increasing capital base and provides a specific government structure for these stressed conditions

capital requirements
triodos bank calculates its internal capital adequacy requirements based on regulatory minimum requirements
pillar i supplemented with additional capital charges pillar ii

minimum capital requirements pillar i
the total minimum regulatory requirement consists of capital charges for credit risk operational risk and
market risk
 credit risk  triodos bank applies the standardised approach sa for calculating its minimum capital
requirements for credit risk the risk weighted asset calculations are done for all onbalance sheet exposures
including the loan book and the investment book and offbalance sheet items such as loan offers not yet
accepted and derivatives exposures
 operational risk  based on the size and limited complexity of the triodos bank organisation the basic
indicator approach bia is used for calculating the capital requirement for operational risk which equals 15
of the average over three years of triodos banks gross income and
 market risk  the capital charge for triodos banks market risk is related to its exposure to foreign exchange
risk the requirement is calculated as the sum of the banks overall net foreign exchange position multiplied by
8 triodos bank only accepts limited net foreign exchange positions in strategic investments and in its uk
activities in sterling gbp as the net position is very limited and does not exceed the regulatory threshold of 2
of the total own funds triodos banks capital charge for market risk is in reality zero
 credit valuation adjustment risk  the capital charge for the counterparty risk of derivative transactions that
are not cleared through a qualified central counterparty

detailed calculations of the minimum regulatory capital requirements and ratios are included in the solvency
chapter on page 108

additional capital requirements pillar ii
in order to determine its economic capital besides the regulatory capital requirements triodos bank also
calculates additional capital requirements these consist of charges for
 concentration risks in the loan book
 interest rate risks in the banking book irrbb and
 model risk related to the calculation of irrbb other risk categories do not depend on sophisticated
modelling the following aspects are captured in the calculations for model risk compliance to regulation
around interest rate risk modelling statistical uncertainty and data quality

external credit rating agencies
in addition to our own opinion external credit ratings  if available  are used to determine the credit
worthiness of the counterparties of our investment portfolio and banks and for a few corporates external
ratings are also used for calculating the minimum capital requirement for credit risk under pillar 1

                                                                          credit rating agency used

entities
 more than 99 of total assets and 97 of profit

materiality
misstatements in the financial statements and the reviewed section of the report can arise from fraud or errors
and are considered material if individually or in the aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements and the reviewed section of
the report the materiality affects the nature timing and extent of our audit and review procedures and the
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion and conclusion

based on our professional judgement we determined the materiality for the financial statements as a whole at
eur 21 million 2014 21 million the materiality is determined with reference to profit before tax 4
2014 5 as we consider this benchmark as the most appropriate benchmark given the nature and business of
the triodos bank in arriving at this level of materiality we have also taken into account misstatements andor
possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for qualitative reasons for the users of the financial
statements




                                                       173

we agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements in excess of eur 01 million which are identified during
the audit of the financial statements would be reported to them as well as other misstatements in the financial
statements and the reviewed section of the report that in our view must be reported on qualitative grounds


scope of the group audit and review
triodos bank operates five branches in five different european countries and is the parent company of a group
of legal entities together they form the group of which the financial information is included in the financial
statements of triodos bank

given that we are ultimately responsible for the opinion we are also responsible for directing supervising and
performing the group audit in this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to
be carried out for group entities and branches decisive were the size andor the risk profile of the group entities
or branches on this basis we selected group entities for which an audit had to be carried out on the complete
set of financial information

our group audit mainly focused on significant branches and group entities where significant should be
interpreted as significant in size and financial impact as well as significant from a qualitative perspective or
audit risk perspective for example due to specific compliance and regulations valuation matters or governance
aspects we have
 performed audit procedures ourselves at triodos bank head office and the triodos bank dutch branch
 we used the work of other kpmg auditors when auditing triodos bank spanish united kingdom belgian and
german branches and triodos investment management bv we provided these auditors detailed instructions
that included significant audit areas including the relevant risks of material misstatement the procedures to be
performed and the information required to be reported back to us we performed site visits to the spanish uk
and german branches and held audit update conference calls with local auditors throughout the audit we also
performed audit file reviews for all full scope audit branches and entities
 performed analytical review procedures at other group entities

by performing the procedures mentioned above at components together with additional procedures at group
level we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to provide an opinion on the
financial statements

       profit before tax 97 full scope audit                       total assets 99 full scope audit


key audit and review matters
key audit and review matters are those matters that in our professional judgement were of most significance
in our audit of the financial statements and our review of the reviewed section of the report we have
communicated the key audit and review matters to the supervisory board the key audit and review matters are
not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed

these matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and the review
of the reviewed section of the report and in forming our opinion respectively conclusion thereon we do not
provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters




                                                        174

key audit matter 1
the valuation of the loan portfolio
description
triodos banks consolidated balance sheet consists for a considerable part of commercial loans and
mortgages loans loans are accounted for at amortised cost less any impairment charges the valuation of
a loan is depending on the credit risk related to that loan when there is objective evidence that a loan might
not be recovered in full or in accordance with the contractual terms for example when there is significant
doubt or evidence on breaches of interest payments or repayment of principal the credit risk and the
valuation of that loan is specifically assessed this assessment requires management judgement and is
subject to estimation uncertainty and can lead to the recognition of an impairment loss on the loan or as
part of the collective provision on a portfolio of loans with similar risk characteristics
our response
we performed specific audit procedures on the valuation of the banks loan portfolio in all branches of
triodos bank these audit procedures consisted of understanding and testing the controls designed and
implemented by the company to provide management assurance over the commercial and mortgage
lending processes as well as understanding and testing the controls designed and applied by the company
for its credit risk management and impairment process of its commercial and mortgage loans these credit
risk management and impairment processes include but are not limited to periodic revision of loans
including applying policies and guidance around ongoing credit risk monitoring of loans and subsequently
the evaluation and valuation assessments of these loans we also inspected individual loan files these
procedures included amongst other procedures selecting 245 individual loan files taking into consideration
sector concentration risk such as for example the solar portfolio in spain and focusing on those loans with a
higher credit risk profile andor an actual event of default in the year under investigation we challenged the
appropriateness of managements key assumptions in the impairment testing including valuation reports of
collateral scenario analysis loan restructuring measures and collateral valuation haircuts and performed
procedures testing the accuracy of managements calculation of the recoverable amount of the individual
loans in relation to the banks mortgage portfolio we assessed the collective provisioning methodology
applied including the relevant parameters in the calculation
our observation
based on our audit we assess the loan portfolio valuation in line with prior year as mildly cautious we also
found that the banks loan documentation showed further enhanced quality and to be up to standard
however can still further improve in overall consistency across the different countries



key audit matter 2
information technology environment
description
in its daytoday operations triodos bank heavily depends on an effective and efficient information
technology environment it environment having a solid general it and application control framework in
place is most critical to the operations of the company since this supports the banking and investment
management service offerings which to a large extent are being offered through the internet channel it is
therefore of importance that safeguards exist regarding the reliability and continuity of the electronic data
processing



                                                      175

our response
we performed audit work regarding the it environment in all branches and for relevant applications and
platforms for the purpose of the financial statements audit our audit work included applications and
platforms supporting the companys business operations as well as those driving the financial accounting
including the enabling infrastructure and service providers as part of our audit we engaged it auditors and
defined a specific it audit plan that outlines it audit procedures to be performed in each branch in relation
to the financial statements audit in our audit plan we distinguished between general it audit procedures
focused on amongst others assessing effectiveness of access controls and security measures and it
application audit procedures focused on the assessment of controls embedded in the operational systems
our plan was also tailored towards the fact that the company operates both an inhouse developed it
system in some of its locations as well as using external it service providers in others
our observation
our test procedures on the design and operating effectiveness of it control measures taken did not result in
significant findings on the reliability and continuity of the electronic data processing for the purpose of the
audit of the financial statements we noted improvements in 2015 regarding access control and information
security measures and discussed further improvements on these topics in 2016 we noted a further growth
and respective complexity of triodos it domain we observed specific focus and actions being taken to
safeguard the banks it continuity and assurance for the future we noted that the general it control
framework is subject to continuous improvements further enhancements and formalisation with emphasis
on improving the control on increasing functional and technical developments



key audit matter 3
valuation of the deferred tax asset
description
as described in note 11 of the financial statements on page 73 triodos bank recognised a deferred tax asset
dta for the amount of eur 69 million for tax losses carried forward in respect of net operating losses
incurred by the german branch the dta represents managements assessment of the amount of net
operating losses incurred by the german branch in the past that can be offset with future german taxable
profits the companys german branch has not yet been able to achieve a breakeven point and reported a
loss for 2015 this resulted in further increase of the dta balance in 2015 given the fact that the dta
balance is dependent on managements estimation on future profitability it is considered as a material
estimation uncertainty in our audit
our response
we investigated the available documentation supporting the dta as at 31 december 2015 and we observed
that this documentation was also reviewed by the companys supervisory board we noted that the financial
performance of the branch improved compared to 2014 however is still loss making and actual 2015 growth
of the loan book was behind budget we also inquired with group and local management on the business
outlook of the german branch and we challenged managements assumptions underpinning it moreover we
challenged management on other relevant expectations applied in their calculation assessment and
conclusions such as on the local business environment market size relevant competition and business
continuity in performing our procedures and reaching our conclusion we also considered the fact that
german tax law allows for indefinite recovery of net operating losses through future taxable income



                                                     176

our observation
we found the dta to be appropriately supported with underlying documentation and calculations which
have been derived from the updated business outlook for triodos bank germany



key review matter 1
assessing the material aspects for the executive board report
description
article 391 part 9 of book 2 of the dutch civil code sets the legal requirements for the items to be included in
the executive board report management of triodos bank decides on the aspects they consider material
based on stakeholder expectations and the relevance for the business of the bank triodos bank updated
the materiality analysis process in 2015 and adapted the way the outcome was presented in the executive
board report the materiality analysis is subject to significant management judgement
our response
we reviewed the process that the bank executed during 2015 to identify and prioritise the items to be
reported we also conducted a media search and a peer review to assess potential material other aspects to
be included and compared these with the companys materiality analysis we assessed the results from the
materiality analysis against the topics as included in the executive board report also taking into account
the guidance as included in dutch accounting standard 400
our observation
we found the process that triodos bank executed during 2015 to be sufficiently solid to identify relevant
material topics for inclusion in the executive board report we also observed that the material topics as
identified in the related process have been reflected in the executive board report in the context of the
purpose of the report



key review matter 2
reviewing methodology and reporting for impact measures
description
the company reports on its impact along eight measures in 2015 triodos bank added two additional impact
measures and the impact per customer for five of the eight impact measures the data for the impact
indicators are inherently subject to assumptions and judgement in conjunction with the related
explanations this may increase the risk that the impact reported lacks sufficient balance for a proper
understanding of its use and reliability
our response
we reviewed the definitions and methodology set by the company and held interviews with management
and key individuals in all branches to understand their application of these definitions and methodology we
requested underlying evidence for the impact figures reported on a sample basis and we compared the
reported projects with the companys underlying information we also conducted a data analysis on the
data reported to identify any potential material anomalies finally we reviewed whether the presentation of
the information to assess whether it provides a balanced overview of the impact as measured by the
company



                                                      177

 our observation
 we concluded that the data reported in the executive board report are sufficiently supported by underlying
 information we also concluded that the impact information as presented as a whole including underlying
 assumptions provides a balanced overview of the impact as estimated by the company
