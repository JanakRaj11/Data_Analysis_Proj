                          our journey
                          at husky we believe sustainability is a key pillar of the financial
                          well being of the company a sound company has the right
                          strategy makes the right decisions and has the wherewithal
                          to make the right investments in the near and longterm

                          at the end of 2010 we presented the business strategy for
                          the company and set out a fiveyear plan with clearly defined
                          financial goals and performance targets almost two years into
                          that plan we are meeting or exceeding our key performance
                          indicators while sustainability begins with a strong financial
                          foundation success is directly linked to how we conduct our
                          business  whether it be in improving safety enhancing
                          environmental performance through innovative ways to
                          protect the environment or in delivering lasting benefits
                          to the communities where we work

                          sustainability requires a strong commitment and i am proud
                          of the improvements we are making this report provides an
                          account of our journey this year
