yums success is built on the integrity and high ethical standards of our associates our ethics and compliance program based on our
worldwide code of conduct demands the highest ethical standards in all of our operations around the globe

and do business throughout the world it calls for the highest standards of ethical behavior from our board members and our 15 million
associates and covers a variety of critical issues including

restaurant employees

our board of directors and our most senior company associates are also required to complete a conflict of interest questionnaire
annually and certify in writing that they have read and understand the code of conduct

we know that in any organization raising an ethics concernespecially about a superiorcan be difficult so we have set up a system
for associates to raise concerns through a safe anonymous process using independent third parties the network inc deloitte

comprise our major markets our associates can use these hotlines 24 hours a day 7 days a week to anonymously raise a concern
about possible code violations or other ethical conflicts not covered by the code after a call the independent third party relays the
information to our management to investigate the concern

the audit committee of our board has established additional procedures for complaints and concerns of associates regarding
accounting and auditing matters including the confidential or anonymous submission of such complaints or concerns more details on
these procedures can be found at wwwyumcominvestorsgovernancecomplaintasp
