     what we do for our customers
     matters and that inspires us

being there
is our
business
we help millions of people gain access to disability life accident and critical illness
benefits through the workplace  benefits that help protect lives and livelihoods
we know individuals and families depend on us to be there when they need us most
and businesses of every size look to us for the benefits that attract talent offer
comprehensive solutions and support the people who keep them growing strong
whether our customers need enrollment services claims support absence management or vocational rehabilitation
services were committed to better benefits at work for our employer clients and their employees and while were a
company with 170 years of history were also finding new ways to offer the coverages we know employees want and
need in 2016 through the acquisition of starmount life we launched unum dental and vision benefits
our products and services are available through our marketleading businesses each with a similar focus to make sure
more people have access to better benefits at work




unum us
a market leader in group and individual disability
benefits in the us and one of the largest providers
of group life and voluntary workplace benefits
unum uk
the leading provider of group income protection
and critical illness coverage in the uk as well as
a provider of life and dental benefits




one of the leading providers of voluntary worksite
benefits including disability life accident critical illness
hospitalization and cancer coverage in the us




we are unum  2016 corporate responsibility report

were there when it matters
our customers count on us for the financial protection they need should illness or injury
occur  closing the gap between personal savings and public assistance and helping
maintain quality of life
thats why we work hard to make sure our benefits and services are robust enough to adjust to the fastchanging needs
of our customers and our world from financial protection to helping employees return to work were committed to
being there every step of the way




69 billion
benefits paid
              327000                                                 people returned to work



35 million                                                                  workers and
                                                                            families protected

were building a bigger safety net
every dollar employers spend offering benefits like ours significantly reduces the need
for governmentfunded support and the burden on taxpayers better yet studies show
employers who offer benefits packages that include disability critical illness life dental
and vision insurance have employees who are more committed and engaged
today many employees in the us and uk lack access to financial protection benefits to help change that we engage
regularly with policymakers and public and private institutions in both countries to find ways to help more people gain
access to this critical financial protection in 2016 these efforts included continuing to work with the us congressional
income protection benefits caucus and the us bipartisan policy center in addition our ceo rick mckenney participated in
the bipartisan policy centers summit on disability and retirement security  new research  next steps an exploration of
new research from the employee benefits research institute that demonstrates people with private disability insurance also
tend to have less of a shortfall in retirement savings

responsibility and transparency go hand in hand
upholding the highest standards of financial responsibility and disclosure is part of our dna our annual reports quarterly
filings and other financial disclosures are publicly available on our website in 2016 we ranked 2nd on the zicklin index
from the center for political disclosure  accountability

coverage
when it
counts
as a customer data specialist
at our columbia sc
headquarters latoya taylor
often urged customers to use
the wellness reimbursement
benefit in their colonial life cancer
policy designed to help cover the
cost of early detection through
mammograms and other screenings
in fact the preventive screening
coverage was one of the main
reasons latoya chose to add the
same policy to her own benefits
as a colonial life employee




we are unum  2016 corporate responsibility report

in june 2013 at the age of 29 latoya was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer known as
metaplastic carcinoma over the next two years her treatment included 16 rounds of chemotherapy 39 radiation
treatments and seven surgeries

never in a million years did i think i would use the policy for anything other than preventive
 screening latoya says but without the colonial life cancer plan there is no question i would
 have lost my home and i would not have been able to afford my health insurance copays
 deductibles and medication
policies like our cancer plan are valuable because they really do make a big difference during a critical time latoya says
cancer doesnt discriminate it doesnt care about how old you are your race your status or anything else
throughout her own journey latoya says her coworkers reminded her of the reason colonial life is a special
place the people
                                          able to work only after chemotherapy treatments and between surgeries
                                               i was overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support given to me
                                                            and my family says latoya ive known people who have
                                                               been through cancer treatment but to actually go through

lessons that

a catalytic leadership experience thats how dr baron davis
superintendentelect for richland county school district two
in south carolina refers to the midlands educator leadership
experience a new program we launched in 2016 for education
professionals in the columbia sc area




we are unum  2016 corporate responsibility report

inspired by other education programs unum has launched and led the midlands educator leadership experience offers
education professionals including leaders and administrators the opportunity to enhance critical professional skills
launched by colonial life in june 2016 in partnership with the midlands education and business alliance the pilot
program focused on connecting participants with key facets of the columbia community including
business and entrepreneurship government and higher education the agenda
focused on examples of leadership across the business sector including
maintaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace how to
influence legislation and on helping educators understand economic
trends that influence the workforce in south carolina

making connections and bridging the gap between
 our local education system and businesses in
 our community are just some of the ways the
 program has made a big impact says baron
the opportunity to visit other businesses to see
 firsthand how impactful culture and values can be in
 sustaining an organization gave us powerful insight
 into the way culture and values can sustain and
 grow our school system too
as the midlands educator leadership experience participants
prepare to graduate from the program plans are already moving
ahead to engage more educators from eight school districts within
three counties  and possibly from across the state
there are a lot of ways to think about education beyond the
 construct of a school and the relationships and connections
 formed through this program are already helping
 catalyze new ideas and more innovative
 approaches to helping todays students
 become tomorrows community
 leaders baron says its giving
 us a bigger canvas on which
 to write our narrative as
 a school district

what do you need thats the first question phil geelhoed
president and ceo of special olympics maine heard when the
organization met with unum to explore ways to team up
what started as a simple grant has become a powerful and exciting partnership says phil of the multiyear
 relationship that has made the presence of unum employees a natural thing at many special olympics maine
 events  including the states annual summer games and an annual bocce tournament for special olympics hosted
 by unum employees
unum employees began supporting the special olympics maine summer games in 2015 and the involvement rapidly
grew from a few hours of volunteer support to a yearround process of helping lead manage and continually improve
the experience for all athletes

                             were a staff of five employees serving 4300 athletes and managing
                                  events throughout our state without the support of good friends and
                                   partners we couldnt do what we need to do says phil even so
                                    our relationship with unum has a strength all its own far beyond
                                    financial support employees from unum commit hundreds of hours
                                     to rolling up their sleeves to help plan events serve as officials
                                      and most important support the athletes themselves
                                         in addition to the nearly 40 employees who dedicate a weekend each year to
                                                  helping manage events for the summer games special olympics now
                                                      has more than 2000 employees to call on for volunteer support
                                                         throughout the year even better phil says are the friendships
                                                           formed between employees and athletes who team up on
                                                             other community service projects like a recent initiative to
                                                              create supply bags for a portland homeless shelter

experiences that inspire
carrying out the hanover theatres mission to foster a love and
appreciation for the performing arts in audiences of today and
tomorrow takes a lot of work and a lot of passion when it
comes to delivering arts education to as many students as possible
including those in previously underserved parts of the community
it also takes teamwork
thats where unum comes in says nel lazour the theaters director of development unum has been a tremendous
 supporter over the years beginning with leadership support for our first capital campaign in 2008 a campaign that
 allowed us to restore and reopen our historic 2300seat venue
today that support has blossomed into an ongoing partnership between unum and the hanover theatre focused on
helping the theater realize its vision of making performance arts available to more youth in the worcester community
throughout the year the theater offers initiatives like its student critic program a series of free writing workshops for
high school students taught by a professional theater critic and the adoptaschool program with worcesters south
high community school the adoptaschool program introduces high school students to live theater by integrating a
broadway production into the schools curriculum and providing tickets for the entire student body nearly 1300 students
from 70 different countries to attend a performance

our adoptaschool program is our most impactful community initiative says nel 2016 marked

were greening
the way we work
improving quality of life for the people and communities we serve includes improving
the quality of the world around us every year members of our volunteer employee
green team roll up their sleeves to help green our world  and our workplaces  through
oncampus projects and offcampus volunteering in 2016 to help more employees get
engaged in oncampus green initiatives we introduced a new employee community site
to share information events and opportunities plus promote environmentally smart
ways of living and working
because our facilities account for our biggest environmental impacts we also continued working to improve our
buildings efficiencies in 2016 much of our effort was focused on our dorking campus in the uk where our facilities
include a historic building an even bigger challenge for environmental efficiency thanks to a multiphase efficiency
improvement project launched in 2015 weve already installed updated lighting heating and ventilation systems in
the buildings busiest areas  generating a savings of 40 for the first phase alone

appreciation for differences
weve worked hard to create a workplace that values diversity and inclusion but we can
always do more to celebrate the differences that make us even stronger
in 2016 we took a good look at the diversity of our company today and challenged ourselves to do more using third
party data assessment and research we benchmarked our progress against other top organizations then built our own
roadmap toward even greater diversity and inclusion every member of our executive senior leadership and middle
management teams also completed unconscious bias training a process that will expand to more of our organization
in 2017 and beyond and we introduced an online diversity  inclusion toolkit to help all employees better consider
diversity and inclusion in their everyday work
greater inclusion also depends on ensuring access to critical skills development training and advancement opportunities
for all employees thats why we also launched several pilot programs in the us and the uk to better empower a
diverse group of high potential men and women across our organization with the support skills and exposure they
need to become leaders of our company in 2016 nearly 40 women and men participated in our new uk women
in leadership us accelerator and us sponsorship programs


accommodating everyone
              providing our customers with long term disability benefits and rehabilitation and returntowork programs
                 is a big part of what we do its a big part of the support we provide our people too physical
                    adaptations to offices equipment and schedules and coaching for people returning to work after
                     illness or injury are all part of the support available to our employees should they need it
