our purpose
hindustan unilever limited has a clear purpose  to make sustainable living commonplace
we believe this is the best way to create longterm value for all our stakeholders especially in a
volatile and uncertain world
our purpose inspires our vision  to accelerate growth in our business while reducing our environmental footprint and increasing our positive social
impact we want our business to grow but we recognise that growth at the expense of people or the environment is both unacceptable and commercially
unsustainable sustainable growth is the only acceptable model for our business
our purpose and vision combine a commercial imperative to succeed against competition with the changing attitudes and expectations of consumers
this annual report and accounts explains how in 201617 we have continued to pursue our purpose and work towards making our vision a reality
during the year we continued to deliver growth that is consistent competitive profitable and responsible this track record of longterm success is
underpinned by the unilever sustainable living plan uslp which helps us manage risk inspires brand purpose and innovation drives down costs to
improve returns and builds trust among consumers across our categories and operations
our success depends on the expertise and talent of our people they are constantly challenged by an environment that remains volatile uncertain
complex and ambiguous digitisation is impacting all aspects of life at the same time it is getting easier to enter our industry the market is fragmenting
as a result of changes in consumer habits sales channels and the media this is why the company is also changing through the business transformation
programme connected 4 growth which we started to implement during 2016 it is creating a business which is more consumer and customercentric
faster more efficient and empowered so that our people can meet these challenges with the necessary resources
as part of this change we are adopting new ways of working to be more entrepreneurial to complement our existing category strategies in turn these
clearlydefined strategies across our four categories ensure that the company has a wellbalanced and resilient portfolio relevant to meeting our
purpose and vision

c fair value hierarchy
the fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note a above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the
valuation technique the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurements
and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements
the categories used are as follows
       level 1 quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market
       level 2 directly or indirectly observable market inputs other than level 1 inputs and
       level 3 inputs which are not based on observable market data
for assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value as at balance sheet date the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarized
below

                                                                                         level 1             level 2            level 3               total

there were no significant changes in the classification and no significant movements between the fair value hierarchy classifications of assets and

calculation of fair values
the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent
with those used for the year ended 31st march 2016

financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at balance sheet date
     1	the fair values of investment in treasury bills government securities and quoted investment in equity shares is based on the current bid price of
         respective investment as at the balance sheet date
     2	the fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value nav as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in
         the published statements as at balance sheet date nav represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the
         price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors
     3	the fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques with market observable inputs the
         models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange forward rates
     other financial assets and liabilities
     	cash and cash equivalents except for investments in mutual funds trade receivables investments in term deposits other financial assets
        except derivative financial instruments trade payables and other financial liabilities except derivative financial instruments have fair values
        that approximate to their carrying amounts due to their shortterm nature
     	loans have fair values that approximate to their carrying amounts as it is based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash flows
        using rates currently available for debt on similar terms credit risk and remaining maturities

notes to reconciliations
a	investment in controlled trust
under previous gaap the investment in the hindustan unilever limited securitisation of retirement benefit trust hurb trust did not qualify as
plan asset under as 15 and has been consolidated as a wholly controlled trust in the group financial statements and the investments in the trust
have been reflected as a non current investment  under ind as the hurb trust qualifies as a plan asset and hence has not been consolidated as
this is excluded under ind a s 110 and the previously consolidated assets and liabilities have no longer been aggregated at the date of transition to
ind as additionally given that the investment is a plan asset for the group the plan asset has been fair valued as per actuarial valuation carried
in accordance with ind as on date of transition to ind as and as at each balance sheet date the plan asset recognised has been netted off against
provision for employee benefits the interest income and remeasurement gainloss on the recognised plan asset has been recognised in statement
of profit and loss and other comprehensive income respectively

c   fair value hierarchy
the fair value of financial instruments as referred to in note a above have been classified into three categories depending on the inputs used in the
valuation technique the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 measurements
and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 measurements
the categories used are as follows
      level 1 quoted prices for identical instruments in an active market
      level 2 directly or indirectly observable market inputs other than level 1 inputs and
      level 3 inputs which are not based on observable market data
for assets and liabilities which are measured at fair value as at balance sheet date the classification of fair value calculations by category is summarized below

                                                                                        level 1               level 2               level 3                  total

calculation of fair values
the fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values are consistent
with those used for the year ended 31st march 2016
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at balance sheet date
1	the fair values of investment in treasury bills government securities and quoted investment in equity shares is based on the current bid price of
    respective investment as at the balance sheet date
2	the fair values of investments in mutual fund units is based on the net asset value nav as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in
    the published statements as at balance sheet date nav represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of mutual fund and the
    price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors
3	the fair values of the derivative financial instruments has been determined using valuation techniques with market observable inputs the models
    incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange forward rates

are reviewed and assessed for default on a quarterly basis
our historical experience of collecting receivables supported by the level of default is that credit risk is low and so trade receivables are considered to
be a single class of financial assets
