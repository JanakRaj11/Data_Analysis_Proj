identifying our impact
lincoln financial strives to continually assess monitor and manage the impact its activities
products and services have on the natural environment as a provider of financial products and
services we have an effect on the earth due in large part to climate control of our buildings
running our technology infrastructure and transportation of our personnel in addition to
energy use providing insurance and retirement plans mandates documentation resulting in the
consumption of a substantial amount of paper products every year which contributes to depletion
of natural resources as a fortune 500 company and leading insurance provider we strive to
understand what resources we use and to manage them as efficiently as possible this is not just
good stewardship it makes good business sense too

                                                                                                     3

    conserving energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions
    long before energy efficiency measures were reported in corporate responsibility reports we
    were engaging in cutting edge measures to reduce the energy we consume in our buildings
    our first largescale centralized and automated energy management system was installed in 1972
    from that point forward we have focused on reducing energy expense through the use of various
    systems processes construction techniques engineering principles technology and best practices


    energy use and efficiency
    lincoln financial has been and will continue to be committed to understanding assessing and
    reducing our energy use over time lincoln financial utilized 88920 megawatt hours of energy
    to run its operations in 2015 our energy use is primarily concentrated in the electricity and fuels
    used to heat cool and power our buildings computers and office equipment


    energy star benchmarking
    given our business activities a major portion of our environmental impact
    results from energy use in our buildings since 2005 we have been tracking
    and benchmarking our energy use in epas energy star portfolio manager
    many owned and operated buildings are energy star certified meaning they
    operate more efficiently than 75 of comparable buildings nationwide
    we have a goal of having all owned and operated lincoln properties energy
    star rated by 2017 although we only began formally tracking our carbon
    emissions in 2011 we know our energy efficiency measures have been
    mitigating our impact on climate change for decades




              for over 30 years lincoln financial has been on the cutting
              edge of building energyefficiency practices

      energy project spotlight
      greensboro building renovation
      from 2015 to 2020 lincoln financial group will engage in a massive renovation
      of its largest owned property the facility in greensboro is a 271000 square foot
      building built in 1922 energy efficiency is a significant driving force behind the
      transformation the building will undergo over the next six years our goal is to
      reduce electricity use across our greensboro campus by 10 by 2020 over a
      2014 baseline the following are some of the many projects that will result in
      energy reductions
     replacing all windows with double paned             building a new centralized plant
      windows and solar reflective coating               replacing all air handlers with new ones
      189 windows per year for six years
                                                          installing higher efficiency pumping systems
     replacing all fans with more energy efficient
                                                          installing higher efficiency boilers and new
      models sized for proper ventilation
                                                           water heaters
     installing demand controlled ventilation
                                                          installing an energy optimizer control system
     replacing two chillers with a single new chiller

      the window replacements alone are expected to save 15050 kwh of electricity and 920 therms
      of natural gas on each installed floor per year in addition to the energy efficiency aspects
      water efficiency is also being addressed through the installation of waterless urinals and low
      flow toilets and sinks



      greenhouse gas emissions
      our company is committed to understanding and managing our own emissions by calculating
      our greenhouse gas inventory and by working to identify ways to reduce our emissions we
      began formally calculating a companywide greenhouse gas inventory in 2011 based on this we
      know our building energy is our greatest contributor to greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere
      accounting for just about 70 of our emissions we continue to track and report our carbon
      footprint annually we also undertake projects that will help us meet our target of reducing our
      scope 2 ghg emissions intensity per employee by 20 over a 2014 baseline by 2020 between
      2014 and 2015 our scope 2 emissions per employee decreased by 33 for more information

    natural resources stewardship
    paper reduction initiatives
    edelivery projects
    being a life insurance and financial product solutions provider our work has always involved paper
    documents application forms policy documents prospectuses confirmations and statements
    make up the bulk of clientrelated paper documentation being a publicly traded company
    also means that extensive annual reports and proxy voting materials must be sent to all of our
    shareholders either directly or through our agents the result is that we send millions of pages
    of documents annually
    for the last few years lincoln financial has focused on reducing the amount of paper we
    generate and send through the mail we have 1 invested in systems that aggregate policy
    documents electronically 2 transitioned to electronic forms and 3 enabled individuals to opt
    into or out of electronic communication access their accounts electronically and even eliminate
    redundant prospectus mailing electronic communication is not always the preferred method
    of delivery for people but increasingly our customers and partners are requesting the option
    we are responding with systems that have both a positive environmental impact and provide a
    convenience to our stakeholders in our retirement plan services area for example we had over
    78000 participants enrolled in edelivery as of june 2016 up 17000 since the end of 2015

    other paperreduction initiatives
    in addition to transitioning to edelivery methods for our clientfacing documentation lincoln
    financial also strives to reduce paper consumption internally efforts in this area are centered on
    strategies such as standardizing duplex printing settings on network printers and consolidating
    printers and multifunctional devices so that the optimal number of printers are provided for each
    area of the business based on the number of users and print volumes in addition employees are
    increasingly scanning documents via multifunction devices and eliminating unnecessary reports
    as a result of these efforts we reduced internal paper usage from 170000 reams in 2014 to
    119000 in 2015 which saved over 1000 trees and avoided 128 metric tons of carbon emissions

    recycling landfill waste
    deskside recycling and other recycling programs are standard practice at all owned and operated
    lincoln financial facilities currently we recycle paper cardboard scrap metal electronics ink
    cartridges batteries wood pallets hazardous liquids and some organic waste in 2015 lincoln
    recycled over 1600000 pounds of paper products over 74000 pounds of scrap metal and over
    15000 pounds of electronics additionally over 184000 pounds of landfill waste was diverted
    through a wastetoenergy program

     making a positive impact
     in addition to reducing the negative impact our business activities have on the environment
     we also strive to make a positive difference by educating our employees about what they can
     do individually and through involvement in conservation service projects

     lincolns ideaswork program
     employee ideas are valued highly at lincoln financial tremendous operational efficiencies have
     been realized as a result of employees coming forth with suggestions as to how we can improve
     a system or process since 2009 our ideaswork program has been the primary vehicle for
     capturing these ideas and for recognizing and rewarding the employees who submit them
     everyone who submits an idea receives a gift if an idea is implemented the employee receives
     public recognition on a quarterly basis the top three implemented ideas are selected and those
     employees receive a financial reward twice a year the continuous improvement team awards the
     brilliance award for the best implementation over the last six months and those employees receive
     500 each many of the ideas resulting from the program have a positive environmental impact
     through paper energy or greenhouse gas emissions reductions some examples include installing
     vehicle charging stations adjusting timing of automatic lighting installing signs to remind
     employees to turn of lights and reserved spaces for carpoolers
