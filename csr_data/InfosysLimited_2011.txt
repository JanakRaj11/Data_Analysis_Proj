stakeholders  customers employees investors and society at large

s d shibulal
chief operating officer and director




beyond the first 30 years
when we started the infosys journey we resolved that we would give
back to society care for the environment and at the same time ensure
maximum profitability for our clients employees and vendors
after covering some distance in this journey we realized that in our
commitment to society and the environment we had in fact been
preparing the ground for creating a sustainable future
armed with this knowledge we redoubled our sustainability
efforts reaping rich rewards in the form of increased employee
awareness empowered members of society and reduced resource
consumption our sustainability mandate includes touching lives by
enabling individuals to use resources conscientiously and intensely
and providing our clients innovative solutions to help them create
sustainable businesses
despite our fast growth we have been able to reduce our per
capita consumption of nonrenewable resources decrease our
carbon footprint help individuals and communities and carry out
our responsibilities as a sustainability agent to the world none of
this would have been possible without the relentless efforts of our
visionary leaders along with thousands of employee volunteers
who have collectively brought about a change in the mindset among
our stakeholders at infosys we are proud to say our sustainability
mandate has percolated across all levels of our operations

that societies and nations desire and without society you will        behind this is that corporations are aggregators of capital and

within the rules and frameworks that defined its creation
and goals
it may be asked if corporations are instruments for the
creation of wealth then why should they look beyond this
the reason is obvious  if a corporation is to be sustainable it
has to have a longterm interest and fulfill its obligations to all
its stakeholders

better incentives to help mothers return to work and aggressive       planet and whether our society is inclusive of the disabled  are
encouragement for young women to enter the profession and              dependent on innovative use of technology

mothers appreciate employer flexibility so that they can balance       meaningful areas that will really set us up for the future or did

efficient cooling technology                                                   we have taken up a new initiative this year to counter the challenge
our new building sdb1 in hyderabads pocharam campus is the first            for managing biowaste in our campuses a smart biogas model is an
radiantcooled office building in india radiant cooling is a technology       automated tracking monitoring verification and reporting tmvr
that has the potential of changing and drastically optimizing the              solution the key challenges in this solution are data identification
cooling processes used for air conditioning in buildings sdb1 has             data collection data communication and data analysis from the biogas
shown impressive energy savings of 40 compared to normal air                  plant our biogas automation framework addresses these challenges
conditioning for a similar building in the first couple of months              it consists of a key software model that is built on the philosophy

the human eye is predominantly used to the light output from
the sun which lights up the space around us uniformly and the                 refer to the biogas generation section in this report for more details
variations are mainly caused by manmade obstacles it is because of           infy megawatt challenge
the same reason that even during early morning and evening we are
still in a position to visualize objects around us clearly even though        this was a firstofitskind effort that provided a great opportunity
the amount of light available might be less than what we have in               for infoscions to get involved with their local communities in line
our office spaces without any strain on our eyes using the same               with the contest motto of go green to get green participants found
principle we are implementing volumetric lighting schemes in our               new ways to save money and reduce their energy consumption
office buildings in conjunction with daylight harvesting techniques           the infosys megawatt challenge website was created to disseminate
the major advantages of adopting this technique are                           and share knowledge the participants in the infosys megawatt
 increase in the efficiency of the lighting system                            challenge have saved an average of 2956 kwh per month till date

we have reduced the consumption of power for artificial lighting
during the day by adopting daylight harvesting techniques combined
with proper building design to ensure glarefree sunlight entering

resource intensity initiatives at our mysore campus

our mysore development center meets about 52 of its fresh water requirements
from ground water sources within the campus due to its superbly implemented water
sustainability strategy the mysore campus enjoys an abundance of biodiversity in the form
of more than 52 species of birds including many endangered ones and many species of
trees the campus also plans to pilot a biogas unit by using the food waste generated at
the campus to produce biogas fuel that will be used in cooking at the food courts


water sustainability
one of our sustainability goals has been to achieve water sustainability and we have made significant progress on this front at our mysore
campus currently our mysore campus meets about 52 of its fresh water requirements from ground water sources within the campus over
the last several years we have constructed eight artificial reservoirs in the campus with a total water holding capacity of almost 40 million liters
we have also constructed six large open wells close to these lakes from which water will be drawn for drinking during fy 201011 we have
sourced about 634 million liters of fresh water from our ground water sources at the mysore campus

trainees planting native trees mysore


biodiversity
we have planted around 40000 trees in the mysore campus during 201011 our sustainable practices have made our mysore campus home
to more than 52 species of birds including many endangered ones a drive on planting native trees is being carried out by the green initiatives
team and so far 2500 saplings of nearly 30 different species have been planted in addition the planting of 3000 sandalwood saplings native
to the mysore region is being carried out to enhance the ecosystem functions the trainees are motivated and encouraged to plant saplings

biogas generation
in one of our newest ecological initiatives it has been decided that the food waste generated from all the food courts in the mysore campus will
be used as feed to a biogas plant the total food waste generated is about 2 tons per day and its biogas generation potential is 120 cum  day
the biogas will be used for cooking in one of the food courts and is projected to save about 50 kg of lpg daily the biogas plant will also help
to reduce about 200 tons of carbon annually

systems and performance the report along with the referenced information in the annual report meets the general content and quality
requirements of the gri g30 and dnv confirms that the gri requirements for application level a have been met we have evaluated the
reports adherence to the following principles on a scale of good acceptable and needs improvement
materiality acceptable the 3 key focus areas of social contract resource efficiency and green innovation forms the basis for materiality
determination the outcome has not missed out any significant known material issues but the process should be validated with more specific
inputs that reflect short medium and long term impacts
stakeholder inclusiveness good the company demonstrates engagement with stakeholders through various channels and has established a
process of collating inputs from various stakeholders as in previous years multistakeholder based objective oriented engagement approach
continues in the field of adoption of cleaner energy and higher education
responsiveness acceptable the company has responded to stakeholder concerns through its policies and management systems and this is
reflected in the report however infosys should consider improving the goal setting process by better monitoring and reviews

defined by infosys we do not believe that the report omits relevant information that would influence stakeholder assessments or decisions

were corrected however improving the internal quality assurance procedures of data management systems will help in improving the process
to reduce potential for errors
neutrality good the information contained in the report is presented in a balanced manner in terms of content and tone the report discusses
both positive and negative trends
