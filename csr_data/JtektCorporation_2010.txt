of further making efforts to enrich csr
as well as a tool to think how to progress toward the future

     jtekt technology
     helping to build a society
     where people can lead secure lives
     advancements in various industry technologies such as cars
     energy and so on have brought convenience
     and luxuriance to peoples lives
     on the other hand securing safety against accidents on the road
     and in the workplace is becoming a major issue of concern
     the first step of jtekts csr is to be strongly
     aware of this issue facing society
     and actively pursue a solution
     this special report singles out but a few products
     from the many examples available and introduces
     how jtekt is contributing to the building of a safe society

     in wind power generation                                                 insulated bearings

     the difficulty of performing maintenance work
     on highup wind power generators is an issue
     of concern
     jtekt have used ceramics to prevent
     electrical corrosion  and develop a highly
     reliable longlasting bearing for wind power                                                    jtekt bearings are used in wind power
     generators reducing the amount of main                                                         generators

     tenance work at heights through longer
     service life has improved safety on wind
     power generation farms

         this is the third year i have given the thirdparty opinion for this          in japan detailing how jtekt are contributing to the creation of a
     report in preparation for writing this column i held two meetings               safe society through their activities how jtekt value their
     with jtekt one at a kickoff meeting and one when the first draft                employees is reported in detail in over three and a half pages
     was complete in which we exchanged opinions in the beginning                   discussing safety hygiene and health here i can only take up a
     i recall thinking that their response towards my suggested future                 few lines but in short there were indeed a great deal of organic
     issues for investigation had weakened but this time jtekt investi               links between the presidents message and the main body of the
     gated into matters more assertively than in the past and this can be              report making it extremely convincing the social report is becom
     seen in a number of places throughout this report i believe that this            ing more enriched with information for example the addition of the
     is evidence that the section of president ikawas message reading                 status of employment of people with disabilities
     through dialogue with our stakeholders listening to their opinions                 the best parts of this report by far were the abovementioned
     and reflecting them in our business activities has materialized                safety hygiene and health and the achieving mental and
         one of the methods i use to evaluate this report is to look for the           physical health sections last years report was highly regarded
     existence of organic links between top managements message                       for giving cases of good practice regarding sustainability commu
     and the body of the report itself in an organic report both the                 nication and networks however this years report is even more
     message and the body of the report are more convincing this is                   enriched and it is safe to say it is at a level that other companies
     the point of view from which i examined this report                              should aim for by continuing this type of quantitative report even
         the presidents message contains the following statements                    more effective measures and policies will be born and i think it will
     reflect upon our achievements and aim to become a corporation                    lead to a decrease in the serious social issue of mental health
     with the trust and understanding of society and in regards to csr               illnesses i hope that jtekts stance on this matter will ripple out
     he begins by saying offering good quality lowcost products                    to other societal issues
     and goes on to say taking societal issues seriouslytaking                           the environmental report went from being divided up into
     action to find solutions also regarding employees president                   processes to being divided up into activity items i think that in
     ikawa clearly states we want to be a company that takes care of                  todays world with global warning a pressing issue this makes the
     working men and women                                                           report easier to understand the section on the prevention of
         in this report expressions such as still in the stage of asking            global warming introduces the reduction of product transport
     and even now in pursuit of the answer appear indicating that                   mileage this is a topic of particular interest to me so i am looking
     jtekt have not just hurriedly thrown together set phrases but                     forward to seeing a quantitative report in the future environmental
     are advancing steadily forward and their sincere stance of having                action is a highlevel area in particular companies that not just
     a desire to share csr knowledge with all employees is apparent                   reach their initial targets but establish challenge targets are
     regarding social issues as well this report looks at creating a                 highly regarded jtekt have already achieved some of their
     safe and reassuring society which is an issue of great importance                targets and i anticipate them setting even higher ones

              we are very grateful to mr tamio yamaguchi representa                that the instilment of awareness towards csr will continue to
          tive of the workers club for ecoharmonic renewable society                be a major issue in the upcoming year the concept of jtekt
          for providing us with his valuable opinion in the kickoff                  csr is based in each individuals behavior and as president
          meeting before work on this report began and after the first               ikawa stated we would like to see employees gain a sense
          draft was made                                                             of selffulfillment at the company watch employees and the
              this time as a thirdparty we received praise from mr                company grow together and see it result in peoples happiness
          yamaguchi but we at jtekt consider ourselves to still be                   and benefits to society
          testing the water when it comes to csr and this praise has in                  in the editing phase we tried to include information that our
          fact had a sobering effect on us as far as thinking about what             stakeholders would be interested in knowing in an easyto
          we can do to advance steadily forward                                      read format we would be happy if this report was useful in
              as mr yamaguchi wrote in efforts to steadily advance                  understanding jtekt we will continue aiming to become a
          forward and share knowledge with all employees we believe                  company which gains the respect of all
