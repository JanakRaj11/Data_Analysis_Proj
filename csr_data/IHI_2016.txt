          turning dreams into reality worldwide

        ihis raison dêtre

        manufacturing technology from ihi has been contributing to society since 1853 originally a shipbuilder

        ihi gradually expanded in parallel with the growth of japan today ihi tackles challenges that aﬀect the

        global environment energy industry and infrastructure as expressed in our corporate message realize

        your dreams our mission is to help customers and society realize their dreams every ihi employee

        understands the value of their work and strives to turn aspirations into reality around the world that is

        the raison dêtre of ihi


        duties as a global company

        as ihi steadily globalizes it has been reinforcing its continuing commitment to sustainable growth

        through a variety of measures this includes the achievement of targets under the sustainable

        development goals which the united nations adopted in september 2015 to encourage public and

        private entities to adopt more sustainable practices going forward we expect to support societys

        sustainable development on an even greater level as we continue to expand worldwide


        to succeed in the global environment a business must take an

        interest in local culture and history and respect human rights

        moreover to meet the diverse demands of people worldwide a

        company must build a corporate culture that facilitates creativity

        and innovation for such reasons ihi is actively diversifying its

        workforce however as the ihi workforce of some 30000

        employees becomes more diverse in terms of nationality and race

        it is important that we all continue to share the same values this

        is why the handbook on ihis basic code of conduct was renewed

        and translated into 18 languages and copies were provided to

        employees in fy2015

           from the outside directors




            ihi has always been at the core of japans modernization process and its strong precision

            manufacturing foundations have driven the safety and credibility that japan prides itself on

            however fy2015 saw an incident that shook these foundations deeply it seems to me that ihi is

            now immersed in a struggle to shed its skin and transform itself for the next phase

            the world is changing faster than we can possibly imagine to react to these changes ihi must

            follow an upward trajectory where it not only selects and focuses its business but also digests

            what it has learned

            ihi has strong operational capabilities on the manufacturing ﬂoor combined with consistent

            organizational strengths from planning to completion these are supported by its steady

            accumulation of experience and its technical background

            i want ihi to create new ﬁelds in which it can use its strengths to globally dominate markets and

            discover business areas where it can become a major player this will put its business on an

            upward trajectory

            ihi must smoothly fuse its factory ﬂoor strengths with its management skills and its businesses

            with social changes in which ﬁelds should ihi take the initiative to accomplish this in an ideal

            future society i hope that ihi will create opportunities to discuss these aspirations on a daily

            basis and cultivate individuals with the intuition to respond to rapidlychanging societal values and

            engineers who can create innovation

            i fully expect that ihi will become a global champion in its next phase




ihi sustainability report2016                                                                                        29

           from the outside corporate
           auditors




            i believe that ihi is a truly good company  one that contributes to society with its monozukuri

            technology and earns the trust of its employees on the other hand from events this past year i

            feel that ihi is not a strong company  one that has the ability to honor its commitments to its

            customers to complete projects within budget and to respond to crises i believe these issues

            were most apparent during the transition from defensive to oﬀensive management in this

            disjointed situation which diﬀers from its past successes ihi must change its thinking on

            organizational structure management and risk assessment

            to achieve this ihi needs systems and ideas that allow it to think and do new things bringing

            diversity into the company such as by hiring expert human resources from outside the company

            making full use of women nonjapanese disabled and lgbt individuals and adapting work styles

            using ict will become the engine for creating new innovation

            csr is like vitamins for a corporation  without it a company cannot thrive ihi needs to create

            shared value by adhering to its core business and contributing to society through it

            ihi has history potential and an excellent management philosophy it must now present a clear

            business vision with the next 5 to 10 years in view and prove that it can execute and achieve that

            vision




          internal control system

        the basic policy for the internal control system is designed to boost the eﬀectiveness of corporate

        governance and increase the corporate value of the group ihi believes that establishing a robust

        internal control system is key to expanding business globally and we are making continuous eﬀorts to

        achieve a sound compliance structure and enhance riskmanagement systems as well as to develop and

        implement a shared management framework throughout ihi

          project auditing system

        the project audit division is under the headquarters and reviews large projects with high contract

        values including construction projects subject to the percentage of completion method to ensure that

        they are being executed properly matters for review include project management risk assessment

        criteria and the transparency of calculating estimated proﬁtability

        as of the end of ﬁscal 2015 84 projects worth about 18 of consolidated sales were being audited in

        the ihi group large projects undertaken either in japan or overseas are audited with consideration for

        the following

         adequacy of the projects execution system and execution plan after the order is received
         appropriateness of the ﬁnal cost estimated in view of current progress
         transparency appropriateness and timeliness of the projects estimated proﬁtability

        for projects that either are worth large amounts or are turning unproﬁtable the project audit division

        goes onsite to verify the state of progress and holds discussions with personnel in charge the division

        works to identify factors leading to declines in estimated proﬁtability of projects and to improve the

        accuracy of proﬁtability estimates for future projects

        when preparing estimates for large projects ihi implements a screening process related to project

        execution risk to verify execution systems the validity of the execution plan and the proﬁtability of the

        project

        to ensure both adequacy and timely rectiﬁcation we will continue to conduct audits and risk

        assessments of construction projects including local assessments as well as strive to further enhance

        our auditing quality each departments activities will be independently audited and evaluated and the

        results will be communicated the department will be notiﬁed prior to the audit regarding the items to be

        reviewed and upon completion of the audit the results will be communicated throughout the group the

        results may be used as case studies for training purposes

        note

        for large construction projects that span more than one accounting period revenue is recognized not

        after construction is completed but instead is recorded as a peryear amount in line with the progress

        of work

           activities in fy2015

           ihi continue analyzing cases of declining proﬁtability by facility type including the conﬁguration of

           equipment facilities or units where such declines occur going forward this analysis and giving

           feedback to business operation division are expected to help prevent losses in projects including by

           identifying causes at an earlier stage




        objectives in fy2016

        before preparing an estimate for a project the unit responsible for the project will identify risk factors

        that can reduce proﬁtability of the project such factors include compliance with the laws and

        regulations of countries where the constructions have never taken place before ihi has a check sheet

        that helps project managers to identify risk factors and strengthens the project implementation

        structure to build a framework for consistent proﬁtability

        2016 plans in fy2016

        compliance at ihi in 2015 focused on understanding what is happening in each workplace and reviewing

        rules to make changes as required managers sought out and corrected issues where rules were not

        being followed or restraints were not working properly that said some managers failed to identify

          strengthening our review process for largescale projects

        considering the continual and signiﬁcant losses in largescale projects in fy2014 and fy2015 we will

        strengthen our project review process in fy2016 these losses were caused by insuﬃcient analysis of

        new ﬁeldprojects and insuﬃcient identiﬁcation of risks in projects that involve conditions we had never

        encountered before going forward we will reinforce these processes by performing our reviews more

        thoroughly and rigorously we will also continue to improve the precision of our estimates and

        strengthen our monitoring structure visualization of project progress and review by key experts at each

        stage will ensure steady implementation of largescale projects and prevent drops in project proﬁt


        support framework for largescale projects




          what is tollgate monitoring

          a system in which stages are set in individual projects for each major milestone from estimate to

          delivery and major deliverables created by the project manager or proposal manager etc estimate

          creator are reviewed by executive management and other relevant individuals in each stage in

          tollgate monitoring you must clear and solve the conditions set at each stage before proceeding to

          the next stage

           topics in fy2015

           the main activities in fy2015 were as follows



           1 preventing problems from reoccurring

           in fy2015 we ran into additional costs with an oﬀshore flng project fell behind schedule in

           another project because of weldingquality issues with the boiler and lost precious time on a bridge

           project across izmit bay in turkey because the catwalk for erecting the main cable collapsed of

           course we quickly took measures to rectify each situation but to prevent any reoccurrence we also

           took steps to strengthen our quality controls and project execution practices



           2 verifying the appropriateness of large investments

           before committing to large investments we set up tollgates to analyze the appropriateness of the

           investment plans and the projected returns on those investments with projects that went forward

           we periodically checked progress



           3 measures against information leaks

           whenever it was necessary to disclose to suppliers or contractors conﬁdential information about

           defense nuclear power or other sensitive content we concluded information security agreements

           that clearly bound those parties to conﬁdentiality and veriﬁed their fulﬁllment of stated obligations

           moreover to deal with targeted threats aimed at ihi we worked closely with governmental agencies

           and strengthened our security



           4 managing working hours

           to get an accurate picture of working hours logged data was fed back to management on a

           monthly basis



           5 protecting trade secrets personal information and important technologies against leaks and

           hacks

           alongside the start of japans national identiﬁcation number system strict groupwide rules were

           established to manage system support and access rights moreover a working group of concerned

           divisions was formed to extract risks set topics of true concern and propose countermeasures




        fy2016 risk management priority action policy

        in fy2015 risks emerged in the implementation framework and quality control of multiple largescale

        construction projects causing proﬁts to fall and repeated downward adjustments in performance

          reducing energy consumption in transportation

        transportationrelated initiatives are targeted at reducing energy consumption by at least 1 annually

        for example when aero engine parts manufactured at the soma no 1 and no 2 aeroengine works are

        sent for assembly at the kure aeroengine  turbo machinery works the company now uses larger

        trucks consolidates diverse products in one truck and runs trucks more regularly

        also a deck crane manufactured at the aichi works is transported by a salvage barge in addition

        rollonrolloﬀ roro ships are being used more often because vehicles can be driven directly on and

        oﬀ the ship for enhanced eﬃciency

        through such measures ihi is intensifying eﬀorts to visualize the amount of energy it expends to

        transport products at each works also the data is reported regularly to the groupwide environment
