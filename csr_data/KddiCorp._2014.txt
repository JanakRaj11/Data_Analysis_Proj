in november 2012 kddi began providing its 4g lte service via an 800mhz platinum frequency
band as of march 14 2014 the actual population coverage rate of 4g lte in the 800mhz band
had reached 99 meaning that the lte service area had increased 15 fold over the previous
year the driving force behind this achievement was the office of area quality improvement
which was established in august 2013 in this article masatomi kinoshita director of the office
of area quality improvement talks about what led to that achievement as well as a variety of
initiatives designed to improve area quality


   making improvements even outside coverage areas

in this day and age with its proliferation of smart phones and mobile data customers have
begun to take it for granted that they will be able to get a signal i realized that showing these
customers kddis area quality could best be achieved using numbers and this led to the actual
population coverage target of 99 for our 800mhz band 4g lte
the actual population coverage ratio is the ratio determined by breaking japan into
500squaremeter blocks and calculating the ratio of the total population in those blocks to the
population that is within kddis service areas the story behind the story of how we raised the
coverage ratio from 96 in march 2013 to 99 just a year later tells of many hardships
including erecting a base station in the middle of a blizzard
however kddis challenges did not end with the achievement of 99 coverage the actual
population coverage only includes areas where people live it does not include highway service
areas or tourism destinations such as mountains or the seaside
it doesnt matter to customers whether an area is a coverage area or not in order to avoid
disappointing customers who take it for granted that they will be able to get a signal no matter
where they go we would have to include in our coverage areas all the places where people go
it was then that the company began to simultaneously develop coverage in places considered
thoroughfares of human activity such as local roads airports and tourism destinations as part
of the process of developing these areas the company carefully determined whether each and
every area was worthy of development based on information provided by local employees
among the areas selected for development were for example the jomon sugi cedar area on
the island of yakushima and tomioka silk mill which at the time was expected to become a draw
for tourists once its scheduled designation as a world heritage site was approved

   stressing unity with customers by supporting events

kddi was one of the first companies to offer support at events where people gather for short
time periods even so at first there were objections from those who doubted the necessity of
setting up vehiclemounted base stations only for the one or two days a particular event was held
however those one or two days are the very times when customers want to use their mobile
phones and our efforts were greatly praised particularly by those who attended the events as we
continued supporting these events while emphasizing customer needs we began receiving
backing from our technology pr and other departments now in addition to setting up vehicle
mounted base stations we have come up with ideas that can create unity among customers
such as deploying human wifis in comic markets these human wifis are employees
dressed up to serve as human wifi access points


   aiming to always be one step ahead in quality

mr kinoshita stresses that eliminating areas where
signals are interrupted is an essential part of getting
customers to experience how easy it is to get a signal in
the areas where there is 99 coverage
for example we have made marked improvements
over the last few years in the ability to easily get a
signal in a moving bullet train previous studies showed
that on the tokyoosaka line the signal dropped to 3g
once on average currently however this has been
improved to once in only one of every five mobile
phones which represents an improvement in quality
that approaches a zero failure rate as of the end of
april 2014
the company is aware that there are still locations in
urban areas such as underground shopping the line status measurement tool made by
complexes and railway tunnels where it is difficult to employees au area
get a signal and work is underway to improve coverage
in these locations one important element of this effort has been the input of employees who
reflect the userspoint of view
we received a great deal of valuable information obtainable only from the customers unique
point of view such as the fact that in commuter train carriages signals are interrupted in the
center of the carriage even though they are stable near the windows the paramount advantage
that employees have is the fact that it is easy for us to make requests of them such as measure
the signal again and give me more details on the circumstances our task is to use this
advantage that employees have to the fullest extent as we continue in our efforts to make
improvements
mr kinoshita stresses that an important part of making sure customers are able to use the
companys products and services in comfort is making
sure they are not dissatisfied and he has identified this
as the mission of his office

as far as customers are concerned the current level of
quality is the norm so there is demand for even higher
quality in order to meet the expectations of these
customers we have to improve quality over and above
current levels thats why its important to continually
work to improve quality

in 2014 kddi was selected for the second year in a row as a nadeshiko brand this program
run jointly by the ministry of economy trade and industry and the tokyo stock exchange tse
selects companies listed on the tse that are actively working to promote the increased
participation of women at the workplace the promotion of womens participation at the
workplace is one of the issues taken up in kddis management strategy in this environment
what kinds of activities are women participating in at the workplace we discussed this issue
with masako yano director of the public relations department at the communications
headquarters talks


   taking the position of executive assistant was the turning point

in october 2013 a kddiau commercial was ranked
first for the month in cmdata banks monthly cm
likability ranking it was the first time in seven years
that kddiau achieved top ranking the person in
charge of that commercial was masako yano
shortly after being hired by kddi ms yano built a
career in the consumer field after creating a proposal
for a rates policy she entered management as a group
leader a position equivalent to section chief her tv commercial au smart value stage version
turning point had come in the fall of 2011
the position of executive assistant had been recently established at kddi the ratio of men and
women in this position was roughly half and half each one was assigned to a company director
of at least the level of a managing director for one year during which they learned the duties of
that directors position on their own ms yano was among those selected for the first round of
this program
that was a time when i was having problems with the difficulty of a management position said
ms yano at this same time the fact that i didnt have a clear idea of what my career goals
should be was also making me anxious
another of the goals of the executive assistant program was training candidates for future
service as executives when ms yano heard about this she was overcome with anxiety caused
by her doubt as to whether she was competent to handle that role however she worked hard to
convince herself that it would be a good chance for further personal growth and this led her to




                                                   7

resolve herself to meeting the challenges of management head on
the executive assistant program has two missions one is to support the director he or she is
working under by vetting proposals before they are implemented and monitoring their progress
the other is gaining experience and knowledge executive assistants attend the same meetings
directors do so that they can learn how to discuss issues with management and how decisions
are made
while working as an executive assistant said ms yano i learned a lot i am particularly
thankful for having had the chance to see for myself the mind and point of view of top
management by observing president tanaka by observing president tanakas powerful ideas
with which and the high vantage point from which he runs the company i came to understand
how management should be conducted and i could imagine myself in those situations i also
understood that many of the things i considered mattersofcourse were not necessarily so from
president tanakas overarching vantage point from that point i always tried to see things from
the perspective of the entire company


    the promotion of womens participation at the workplace is likely to gain even more strength

after completing the executive assistant program ms yano became the director of the public
relations department a field she had no experience in
in this age in which there is almost no difference between the price plans and mobile units
offered by the various companies the most important way we can get customers to choose us is
to make sure they have goodwill toward au to ensure this president tanaka had the idea that
we need to improve communication even further understanding the expectations and ideas of
top management based on his or her own experience is useful to the executive assistant in
making decisions as a line chief 1
ms yano used what she learned during her time as executive assistant to aim for new heights in
fiscal 2013 the number of women in managerial positions throughout all of kddi was 140 this
was three times the number in fiscal 2007 but the percentage of women in managerial positions
visàvis the total number of managers was a mere 36 ms yano talks about her reaction to
these figures
the fact that there were so few role models said ms
yano was one important reason why women dont
become enthusiastic about seeking managerial
positions but now that there is not only a system in
place that allows women to work longer but there are
also chances for women to be promoted to upper
managerial positions means that the number of women
in management will definitely go up if there are more
role models the number of women with an image of the
kind of manager they want to become will also naturally
rise and this will contribute greatly to increased
motivation among those employees who are aiming for managerial positions

engulfed in the age of the smartphone there was a feeling at kddi that active communication
with the outside was essential to further development the awareness of this problem was what
led to the initiative to support venture companies the name given to this initiative is kddi 
labo mugen labo under the slogan towards unlimited development that exceeds our
imagination through cooperation with the unlimited potential of young people we are working
toward making the innovations that occur within into developments that exceed our imagination


   communicating with the outside world by supporting entrepreneurs

kddi  labo hereinafter referred to as mugen labo
is a program that supports the development of global
internet services it targets venture business owners
and engineers including students who have recently
set up their companies tomohiro ebata in charge of its
promotion talks about the story behind the creation of
mugen labo a program keenly focused on the outside
world

as the age of the smartphone advanced young people
found themselves in an environment in which it was kddilabo space
easy to start up a business still there were cases in
which service and venture companies that managed to get off the ground later disappeared
because their founders did not have the wherewithal to keep them going one of kddis
philosophies is look outside yourself to know yourself taking a cue from this i thought id like
to try and communicate with the world outside kddi by supporting young entrepreneurs i
thought that this communication would in turn fuel the kind of innovation and development i
wanted to achieve

company president takashi tanaka offered strong support to the realization of this idea
president tanaka dreamt of starting a company while he was an exchange student at stanford
university in the us but in those days the development and support environments of today did
not exist

as someone in a position to offer support says president tanaka i would like to be of help to
young people today who have the same dream i had when i was young

with the backing of president tanakas new dream mugen labo kicked off in 2011


    discovering business hints leads to greater employee motivation

this support however is not financial assistance
rather it is support that is designed to create an
environment that is conducive to development and
commercialization teams selected from a pool of
applicants are provided with mentors people who offer
advice and guidance chosen from all departments of
the company and outside advisors young venture
company        executives     business      administration
consultants lawyers researchers who offer advice on
commercialization and business management the
participating teams have the goal of releasing a beta
version test version of their idea in three months
applicants number one hundred or more each round
mr ebata talks about how difficult it is to narrow this
field down to approximately five teams                     giftee a team in the first round of kddi  labo
no matter how interesting an idea is simply being new program
and original does not mean that it will succeed as a
business the important factor is whether the idea is able to solve a problem that exists in the
world for example giftee one of the teams in the very first round is an internet service that
developed microgifts which are small gifts that can be sent via email but in japan there is no
custom of giving gifts worth just a few hundred yen each the fact is however that there are
countless times when people want to express a little appreciation we were impressed by the
novelty of that perception
currently giftee is making great progress while at the same time kddi is also benefiting through
mugen labo though we expected to get business hints from concepts that are outside the
normal business operations of a telecommunications company the fact that these could be
effective in employee training was unforeseen
contact with the participating teams produced changes in the young employees in their 20s and
30s who acted as their mentors observing entrepreneurs of the same age who were staking
their very lives on the challenges they had to meet in the program led them to wonder whether
they themselves were capable of doing more and this led to increased motivation


    moving toward the second step in acting as a bridge between venture companies and big
    business

as the program continued into its fourth and fifth rounds observes mr ebata problems with
mugen labo began to arise
the primary problem says mr ebata was how to create a good relationship with teams that
have graduated the way we solved this was by aiming to build a strong partnership from the
very beginning and as of the sixth round we changed the program so that it was focused on
teams that were starting from scratch we emphasized building relationships with the graduating
teams and established a program called the engineer pool orders sent to graduating teams
whose business operations were related to kddi services began to increase the idea was to
create business linkups with them as we continued to offer support
recently an increasing number of major companies have inquired about contacting venture
companies mr ebata believes that what lies behind this increase in interest is the fact that large
companies in japan surprisingly do not have much interaction with venture companies as well as

the fact that mugen labos perseverance has created the impression that kddis venture
company initiative is at the forefront of this field
we have designated our second stage of development as the stage in which we make kddi an
enabler1 we would like to actively work to support
venture companies in cooperation with other major
corporations i believe that this is something that kddi
is uniquely positioned to achieve since we already have
the advantage of established interaction with venture
companies
not satisfied with offering only support mugen labo is
moving toward acting as a gobetween for venture
companies and big business an endeavor that
promises a wealth of business opportunities

many people would be hardpressed to find the connection between kddi and biodiversity
protection but the key resides in underwater acoustic technology we spoke with junichi kojima
who serves as project leader at kddi rd laboratories about his efforts in a longterm project
to study the behavior of endangered species


   using sound technology to save endangered species

since joining kddi kojima has been involved in the development of underwater robots used in
the installation and maintenance of undersea cables underwater communication generally
relies on sound alone says kojima sound waves are used to communicate with underwater
robots that were developed to inspect undersea cables this was the original purpose of our
acoustic technology

the underwater acoustic technology developed by
kddi rd laboratories has been constantly advancing
and improving through practical experience the
technology was first put to use in the observation of
animal behavior 15 years ago with a study on the
behavior of whales

researchers from the university of tokyo who were
developing underwater robots approached me with a
proposition to use underwater acoustic technology to
study the behavior of whales at the time i felt that the    ae2000 underwater robot equipped with hydrophone
                                                              array on wings
project would be a worthy challenge to see what role my
underwater robots could play in another field

kojimas team worked with the university of tokyo to jointly develop a whaletracking system
which was then incorporated into underwater robots used for inspecting undersea cables they
initially tested the technology in a study of humpback whales around zamami okinawa in 2000
in 2004 they started using the underwater robots to study sperm whales around the ogasawara
islands

in the course of studying whales the behavior of the endangered ganges river dolphin surfaced
as a new topic of study


   using sound to observe the movements of animals that are difficult to view

due to water quality deterioration and bycatch in fishing nets indias ganges river dolphin
population had dwindled to about 2000 making it an endangered species says kojima the
government of india implemented measures to protect the dolphins but the murky water made
visual observation difficult so there were many things about the dolphins that we did not
understand for this reason it became crucial for us to understand their behavior in order to
prevent their extinction

river dolphins emit ultrasonic waves that humans cannot hear these sound waves bounce off
objects and return to the dolphins enabling them to understand their immediate environment
the use of underwater acoustic technology makes it possible to capture these ultrasonic clicking
sounds enabling researchers to perform observation with greater reliability and without affecting
the behavior of the subject unlike the use of microchips attached to the body

with expectations high in india the project became a joint effort between a japanese team
mainly from kddi rd laboratories and the institute of industrial science at the university of
tokyo and an indian team with members from wwf india and the indian institute of technology
iit

however things did not go smoothly says kojima the river bank where we planned to
conduct the study karnavas region is regarded as a sacred place by the local people who come
to the ganges to bathe so it was not easy to get permission

initially the research team successfully studied river dolphins in another area chilika lake and
drew attention to those achievements in order to bolster support following their success they
started studying the ganges river dolphins at karnavas in 2008 however they had to fight an
uphill battle against a multitude of problems that hindered the study including a powerful storm
that blew away their tent as well as the intense heat and humidity which seriously affected the
health of the staff one by one despite the great difficulties however the team achieved great
results in this study as well

kojimas team developed a new observation apparatus
for studying the behavior of the ganges river dolphin
the apparatus incorporates position measurement
technology used in underwater robots and it features
six hydrophones underwater microphones that are
configured to perform triangulation the simple system
operates by measuring the differences in arrival time of
sound at each microphone enabling the researchers to
accurately determine the position of the river dolphins in
three dimensions

if we understand the position of the river dolphins we placing underwater microphones
can understand their movements which brings their
habits into view says kojima our research up to this
point has for example improved our understanding of how river dolphins raise their young first
we learned that adult river dolphins produce different clicking sounds than those of the young
and recently we came to understand that the young are kept together in a group at one location
and the adults go back and forth to care for them

   aiming to expand activities around the world

sound waves received by the device are analyzed in realtime using a computer and the data is
transferred over the internet via a mobile phone modem and stored in a server located in japan
furthermore this data can be shared in realtime with researchers around the world if a special
graphical user interface gui is installed

in addition to research efforts to make this type of data open can also help to save animals
three years ago kojima was contacted directly by a professor at mulawarman university in
indonesia who expressed a desire to work together to study critically endangered irrawaddy
dolphins in the mahakam river in borneo the researchers began using acoustic technology to
study the irrawaddy dolphins in 2013

meanwhile kojima intends to continue studying the ganges river dolphin there is still a lot that

the development of information and communications technology ict has led to the emergence
of the digital divide which refers to the economic social and employment inequality gaps that
arise between people based on their ability to use or access technology kddi pursues a variety
of activities in developing countries to bridge the digital divide including a project to construct
schools this project which broadens our global perspective as a member of international
society while remaining independent from information communications technology is receiving
much attention both in japan and overseas


   motivated by the innocent delight of children

with over half a century of involvement in international contribution activities the kddi group
has accepted approximately 5700 trainees from 144 countries and made numerous other
achievements kddi foundation currently plays a key role in the kddi groups international
contribution activities in five areas 1 overseas human resource development 2 dispatch of
experts 3 projects to bridge the digital divide 4 overseas consulting and 5 educational
support as one of the educational support activities kddi foundation donates schools to
cambodia

according to yuki umezawa who heads the school construction project in his role as senior
manager of the international cooperation department the motivation for the project began in
2004 after a representative from the world assistance
for cambodia ngo referred to below as the ngo
which conducts support activities in cambodia came to
give a speech the shock at the lack of schools in
cambodia spurred the project into action since then
kddi foundation has sponsored a charity classical
concert every year and the proceeds and contributions
are donated toward the construction of kddi schools
elementary and junior high schools which are built at
a rate of one per year in various parts of cambodia with
the cooperation of the ngo                              children in the kddi school

since the first school was constructed we questioned whether it was sufficient to just provide
the school buildings says riyoko kojima who is involved in the kddi school construction
project as we wrestled with these doubts and held meetings with the ngo we started to
discuss how we might be able to develop human resources that can lead cambodia into the
future if we could teach them it skills and english in particular due to kddis unique potential
to offer support as a telecommunications company we decided to use kddi foundations
financial resources to support it and english education with that a new objective for kddi
foundation was born

prior to opening the school an internet environment was established and educators were hired
to teach the it and english classes in november 2005 the projects first facility named phom o
kec school was completed in the village of phom o located in a forest area approximately 200
kilometers north of the capital city of phnom penh

i went to the school opening ceremony and was surprised says kojima i had heard that the
village was in a remote area with no electricity but it was beyond what i expected the roads
were accessible only by motorcycle so i had to ride in on the back seat of one it was a struggle
but i finally arrived

when she arrived at phom o elementary school children and adults from the village had
gathered there for everyone in the village it was their first time to see a personal computer or
digital camera when the adults were shown a video they recoiled in astonishment however
the children had stars in their eyes and they quickly learned how to use the devices she says
after witnessing the innocent delight of the children and seeing the poor state of education with
our own eyes it was our natural inclination to want to do the same thing again the following
year


   support that bolsters the future of the local people

it was not the original plan to continue the project for ten years but it has carried on simply
because it has provided so many benefits and no reasons have emerged for stopping it

as we continued the project some issues arose particularly in terms of operating costs says
kojima if you increase the number of schools expenses such as salaries for it and english
instructors and the costs of computer maintenance start accumulating until they pose a
significant burden however we couldnt just stop constructing schools the reality is that no
matter how many we build it isnt enough

ten years after the project began the members have been able to look back on their experience
and assess the issues that they have encountered along the way they have reaffirmed their
commitment to the original purpose of the project which was to construct school buildings and
provide places to learn and they have vowed to continue no matter what it takes however they
have shifted course with respect to support for it and english education and they plan to
continue offering it as an extra program in areas where the proper environment can be
sustained

in addition to our own issues we also encountered an
issue facing cambodia which is that there are no music
or physical education classes in their elementary and
junior high schools says kojima

kojima recalls that just when they started considering
the possibility of developing education enrichment
programs they discovered traditional cambodian
shadow puppetry known as sbek thom at the time
the project members discussed the idea of trying to
                                                              sbek thom performance at the donated special

                                                  16

establish an afterschool program similar to the kabuki appreciation classes offered at schools in
japan

even though sbek thom is a traditional art there arent many young people interested in
carrying on the tradition she says instead of inviting children to see it once and stopping there
we considered support that would enable theatrical groups to continue and donated special
theaters with practice rooms

it is not enough to provide temporary shortterm support the kddi group aims to provide
support that benefits the longterm future of the local people to that end it is important to view
the local people with their unique way of life and culture as colleagues who coexist in the same
era the kddi group which has been engaged in international contribution activities for many
years has embraced this perspective and stance at a fundamental level


   bringing smiles to children in the federated states of micronesia

kddis efforts to bridge the digital divide have expanded to micronesia computers that were
previously used at kddi offices are donated to the federated states of micronesia and five

since the great east japan earthquake many companies have been engaged in supporting
reconstruction kddis particular form of support has been to send employees to the stricken
municipal governments this was an unprecedented type of support and as such it was covered
by media how did kddi come up with this type of support and what kinds of relationships with
the stricken areas have been formed through this activity hironori abe director of the
reconstruction support office and person in charge of these activities talks about these issues


   realizing we didnt truly understand the situation in stricken areas was the starting point

currently the reconstruction support office which was established in the city of sendai in july
2012 has a staff of six including hironori abe however the five staff members other than mr
abe all work at local municipalities the reconstruction agency and similar organizations
at each municipality where we have staff members we are working to understand from the point
of view of local people what their needs are said mr abe and are searching for ways in which
we can use it and related technologies for the purpose of reconstruction support this was not
the form our reconstruction efforts took immediately after the disaster it was rather the result of
reflecting on our first year of reconstruction support activities
in the beginning kddi proposed supplying merchandise that it thought was required for
reconstruction but for a while local municipalities ignored the companys offers
there were two main reasons for this explained mr abe one was that we didnt truly
understand the fact that the municipalities were already overwhelmed with the immediate
problems of daily life the other was the fact that we didnt understand the sort of work that
municipalities do
once the office understood that the problem was our lack of understanding the local
municipalities they realized that they needed to think about what the municipalities actually
wanted and thats when we decided that we would send employees to the municipalities
reflected mr abe

   variety in the work done at municipalities

support activities were begun in october 2012 at
kamaishi city hall iwate prefecture the kddi
employee sent there worked out of the department of
public information and public relations this employee
worked on creating plans and proposals for ict used in
municipal duties making plans for an integrated ict
facility and similar tasks
subsequently employees were sent to other
municipalities one employee per municipality the
employee sent to kesennuma city hall miyagi
prefecture worked on a base for transmitting the citys
public relations magazine and tourism information and
                                                          at the assigned kamaishi city hall
system maintenance for this base the employee at
higashi matsushima city hall worked on promotion of the city as an ecofuture city and
surveying the citys energy infrastructure and the employee at sendai city hall worked on a
reconstruction project known as the ecomodel town project
since each of these activities was suited to the needs of each area explained mr abe each
was unique but in the end each plan was as comprehensive as possible including everything
from systems to services and from planning to implementation


   use in community development around the country

as employees increasing become a part of the communities they work in as residents they are
able to understand more and more

in the past there were stories in the media about money allocated for reconstruction being left
unused said mr abe but that did not happen because there was nothing that could be done
with the money what we came to understand from the people in those areas was that the cause
behind this was the fact that they had no time for the application process required to receive the
money the employees sent to kamaishi and kesennuma lived in temporary housing so they
were far more sympathetic to the concerns of local residents  and especially the victims 
because they could speak directly with them

there were many things that we came to understand through the experience of living in the
stricken areas and our ability to see things as the local residents helped us create relationships
with them those relationships explained mr abe were the powerful driving force behind our
reconstruction support efforts

even though the program of sending employees to stricken areas has ended our basic position
of offering support has not changed said mr abe even though our initial goal was to make a
contribution to society our goal now should be to create
a system in which local industry could succeed on its
own no matter what course out next step takes we
realize that it will be a new challenge the problems we
see in the tohoku region such as the ageing population
and population declines are problems that exist
throughout japan the fact that kddi now has a good
understanding of the work that municipal governments
do will fuel its future efforts we would like to use the
knowhow we have gained to support community
development around the country

kddi is actively engaged in efforts to promote employment opportunities for people with
disabilities at the core of these efforts is kddi challenged corporation a special subsidiary
company established by kddi we spoke with administration manager kimikazu ikeuchi on a
wide range of topics related to employing people with disabilities ranging from hiring and
education to operations planning


   expanding employment opportunities for people with mental disorders

in april 2008 kddi challenged was established as a special subsidiary company aimed at
creating an environment and opportunities that can challenge both disabled and ablebodied
people

up to now kddi has actively employed individuals with physical disabilities but the company
has been presented with the obligation to employ people with mental disorders in fy2018
initially people with mental disorders are to be employed in the special subsidiary company and
efforts will be made to expand the range of opportunities outside the company ikeuchi believes
these efforts will lead to greater employment opportunities for people with mental disorders who
continue to face barriers to employment

the current efforts which have been developed through trial and error are to assign people with
mental disorders to operations that make use of the unique characteristics of each disability for
example developmentallydisabled people with extraordinary math skills can be put to work in
accounting or purchasing operations and people with asperger syndrome who have difficulty
communicating with others can be put to work in individual activities such as pc kitting which
requires concentration and precision by relying on each individuals personal qualities the
range of occupations can be expanded for people with mental disorders our company now
employs 23 people with mental disorders says ikeuchi with pride

these expanded operations are attracting attention from many companies across a wide range
of industries there are increasing requests for lectures and observation tours from parties who
wish to learn from the achievements and expertise that kddi challenged has gained in
employing people with mental disorders




                                                  20

   diversifying operations while focusing on personal qualities

initially kddi challenged employed people in relaxation room acupuncture and massage
operations and mobile phone disassembly and separation operations the company decided to
become involved in the relaxation room activities because other special subsidiary companies
were also involved and because the relaxation services and facility are provided as a wellness
benefit to kddi employees the company also decided to become involved in mobile phone
disassembly and separation operations because they involve simple activities for the
mentallyhandicapped that require concentration and manual labor and they contribute to the
material recycling efforts promoted by kddi

in working with employees with disabilities you shouldnt simply give up when there is a task
that cannot be performed says ikeuchi if you consider the body of the employee who is
performing the task and reconsider the procedure and instructions for performing it you can
devise a way for them to carry out any operation instead of thinking that they cant do it because
of their disability with this approach opportunities have been expanded to include accounting
and purchasing operations mobile phone maintenance center operations pc kitting support
activities for related companies and business mobile phone recycling operations

recently mentallyhandicapped employees took on the challenge of mail delivery operations for
the first time says ikeuchi moving forward we plan to continue making a variety of efforts as
we expand operations and open up new opportunities for challenge we will continue to focus on
developing more comfortable work environments we are embracing a variety of challenges in
creating environments that take personal qualities into account such as installing colored and
textured floors that facilitate the mobility of the visuallyimpaired and creating new seating
arrangements and playing background music for employees who have trouble concentrating
because they pay too much attention to the people around them


   committed to the mission of providing longterm employment

meanwhile kddi challenged is engaging in efforts
aimed at companies in the kddi group which seek to
improve understanding toward people with disabilities

this fiscal year the training sessions for new
employees at kddi and each of the group companies
included an opportunity to experience kddi challenged
operations says ikeuchi activities included
communicating with hearingimpaired members and
working with mentallyhandicapped members to
disassemble and separate mobile phones eating lunch
together and sharing time as coworkers seemed to             new employees observing mobile phone disassembly
                                                              and separation operations
boost the mindfulness of everyone involved
participants voiced impressions such as after working
with people with disabilities i realized that they do not
view their disabilities as a way out and i realized the
importance of being considerate to others regardless of
whether they are disabled or ablebodied when i hear
impressions like these it gives me a great sense of
expectation for the future because if the kddi group is
filled with employees who think this way it will become
an even better company

always mindful of the importance of providing longterm
employment at kddi challenged ikeuchi discussed his




                                                  21

ambition to keep searching for activities that people with disabilities can accomplish if we
devoted the necessary attention to the personal qualities of each person one by one it would not
be difficult at all to employ people with mental disorders he says by encouraging the
employment of people with mental disorders i think we can contribute to broadening the
employment possibilities for all people with disabilities

 boosting employment opportunities

a business continuity plan bcp is a structure that is put into place under usual conditions
which ensures that important business operations can continue uninterrupted in the event of a
disaster always striving to develop and implement bcp measures to fulfill its responsibilities as
a telecommunications operator even during largescale disasters kddi established the disaster
prevention planning office in april 2012 and is making efforts to improve the speed and safety of
disaster countermeasures we discussed these efforts and activities with akira dobashi
executive director of the general administration  human resources division who served as
director of the disaster response office until march 2014 along with hiroshi kisanuki general
manager of the disaster prevention planning office which plays an active role in affected areas


            realistic training drills that assume largescale devastation

although kddi has long implemented bcp measures the experience of the great east japan
earthquake motivated the company to rapidly intensify efforts to establish bcp measures that
assume a greater level of devastation akira dobashi discussed emergency assembly drills and
disaster response drills which represent the two main types of training exercises

emergency assembly drills mainly involve department
directors managers and senior level employees who
walk or ride bicycles from their homes to a designated
meeting point says dobashi because we never know
when disaster will strike emergency assembly drills are
conducted without advance notice even in winter or
summer or in poor weather this adds a greater sense
of realism to the exercises the purpose of emergency
assembly drills is to check whether the participants
actually gather together and more than 60 of
participants successfully carry out the exercise even               disaster response drill
though they are conducted without any advance
notice

disaster response drills on the other hand aim to test whether business operations can be
recovered according to bcp objectives for example in an exercise conducted last year

participants were presented with a scenario of a major earthquake in the nankai trough without
advance notice and asked to respond with the appropriate actions in their departments

new lessons are learned each time drills are conducted says dobashi participants also
become acutely aware of how important it is to accumulate experience under normal conditions
when events do not occur as anticipated the participants must consider other procedures that
can better prepare them for the future in this sense the drills encourage them to pay meticulous
attention so that they can always be prepared to respond to unforeseen situations


   accumulating practical expertise in preparing for major disasters

a core component of the kddi philosophy is the mission to provide stable services that are
available 24 hours a day 365 days a year the operations departments are responsible for
fulltime network monitoring which is key to fulfilling this mission

hiroshi kisanuki who serves as general manager of the disaster prevention planning office
discussed how his department came to be established previously the disaster response
section played a lesser among the operations departments he says but after our experience
with the great east japan earthquake there was a sense of crisis that maintaining the status
quo would leave us inadequately prepared for a major disaster as a result the disaster
prevention planning office was established in april 2012

the mission of the disaster prevention planning office
is to ensure that communications can always be
provided even under abnormal circumstances by
coordinating with the operations departments in each
region throughout japan and by studying and making
advance preparations from a bcp perspective in the
two years since the disaster prevention planning office
was established equipment has been expanded
significantly through measures such as doubling the
number of mobile base stations and power generators
in addition to simply acquiring equipment efforts have disaster recovery drill using a helicopter
been made to improve expertise by responding to issues that arise at largescale events

at events such as fireworks displays where the communications environment is not sufficient
we provide more reliable communications by making adjustments based on the activity of the
people at the event says kisanuki similarly unexpected numbers of people gather at places
such as evacuation sites during disasters and the way to ensure communications in the area is
a major issue for this reason we thought that the expertise gained through responding to
largescale events would be useful

in terms of personnelbased measures a variety of efforts are being pursued in human resource
education and training one such effort is a contest between regional teams in setting up
vehiclemounted base stations

the point is to set up the base stations safely and quickly but it is up to each team to decide
how to set them up says kisanuki this lets us see the advantages and disadvantages of each
procedure the competition improves our technical capabilities and it also helps to boost
motivation

in addition more than 50 training exercises per year are conducted with local governments
when setting up a vehiclemounted base station during a disaster for example several hours
might be lost if the installation site has not been decided training exercises can improve
understanding on both sides resulting in a smoother response when a crisis occurs each and
every training exercise is carried out with this critical importance in mind

   always aware of the importance of kddis activities

it is also evident that employee awareness of bcp is improving a prime example of this is a
measure to ensure the constant presence of decisionmakers executives in tokyo take turns
residing near specified buildings so that decisionmakers are always available 24 hours a day
365 days a year

customers who tour the disaster response office facilities are often surprised at the extent of
kddis preparedness which raises the question of why kddi takes such thorough bcp
measures

like the kddi philosophy which clearly states our mission to provide stable services 365 days
a year kddi employees are highly aware that our business activities are closely linked to social
infrastructure says dobashi i think this awareness drives us to pursue aggressive bcp
measures

kisanuki concurs the employees in the operations departments are extremely aware of the
importance of protecting the network he says two hours after the great east japan
earthquake struck employees from all regions across japan were heading to the stricken area
without any instructions to do so

for kisanuki the desire to see customers smile is a source of motivation at the time of the
earthquake i was serving as director of the kanazawa technical center he says kanazawa
was functioning as a logistical base for tohoku and i had also previously worked in sendai so i
quickly rushed off to the area the customers there welcomed me with smiles the end goal of
our mission is to make the customers smile and that joy has become my motivation

dobashi also recalls how his heart was touched by
words of gratitude from customers after the
earthquake i received letters from people who thanked
me for the peace of mind they got when they could
finally talk on the phone with their families after not
hearing from them for days it was a powerful reminder
of the importance of our work i think that we need to
remain committed to our bcp efforts so that we never
lose sight of our mission to provide continuous
communications

 initiatives in preparation for emergencies

environmental initiatives and expectations of kddi

we invited two environmental experts to participate in a lively dialogue with kddi
representatives on the topics of creating a lowcarbon society and protecting biodiversity

the invited experts




            satoko ekberg director of esquare inc        hiroshi onoda director of waseda university
            guest lecturer at tohoku university              environmental research institute associate
            graduate school of environmental studies         professor at waseda environmental institute



part 1 issues to address in establishing a lowcarbon society

creating an efficient logistical system with the supply chain in mind

ekberg many of todays social issues are related to climate change in one way or another the
co2 emission reduction targets set forth by japan at cop19 19th session of the conference of
the parties to the un framework convention on climate change were regarded as lackluster
at the same time electrical appliance and electronics manufacturers in the 2008 to 2012 period
reported a 43 increase in average annual manufacturingrelated co2 emissions compared to
1990 levels and a 48 decrease in co2 emissions intensity how should we view this also as
floods and droughts intensify due to climate change there is a need for us to think together about
a sustainable model of development in emerging and developing countries companies play an
important role in improving the situation and i think it would be nice to be able to discuss what
can be done to establish a lowcarbon society and what is necessary to lay the groundwork

onoda in measures taken by companies to combat global warming attention is being paid to
scope 3 1 which tracks and reports co2 emissions in the value chain it is difficult to reduce
emissions only through conventional energysaving measures so there is a need for measures
involving the transport of business partners and employees to and from work the procurement of
parts and other factors at the same time discussions have started on the idea of a scope 4 that
indicates the level of contribution to society for example environmentallyfriendly products such
as solar power generation systems rechargeable batteries and electric vehicles can help
society curb co2 emissions but the companies that manufacture the parts and materials
increase their co2 emissions scope 4 would take this increase and decrease into consideration
by quantifying the contribution that companies make toward societys reduction of co2
emissions even though they themselves increase their emissions

1 this is one of the scopes that is calculated and reported for a companys greenhouse gas emissions

moderator for kddi the amount of electricity consumed in telecommunications is increasing
but the customers can reduce co2 emissions by using the kddi network for videoconferencing
which reduces the need for business trips and meetings outside the office and for sending
electronic files instead of heavy paper documents

kddi it will be valuable for us to consider the rules for calculating the level of contribution ie
scope 4 once they are established now we are focused on improving the efficiency of a wide
variety of logistical operations to reduce our co2 emissions we are studying how to improve the
efficiency speed and cost of logistical operations such as gathering products from business
partners at the local logistical centers and distributing them to au shops and retailers returning
reclaimed mobile phones to the manufacturers and distributing base station materials
nationwide

onoda in the general insurance industry efforts are being made to recommend energyefficient
driving with the aim of reducing automobile accidents and insurance premiums as well as the
impact on the environment in other words by tracking the fuel consumption data we can
improve driving efficiency and traffic safety while reducing co2 emissions this leads to a
greater focus on accident rates in the transport industry and it promotes fuel economy and
energyefficient driving in addition to backbone logistics home deliveries and individual item
shipping to end users needs to be managed properly to reduce co2 emissions so kddi should
place a higher priority on measures for smalllot logistics it is important to address questions
such as how to utilize return vehicles effectively whether they can carry other items back or
whether they can be used in cooperative transport operations with another industry

kddi in examining the distribution from logistical centers to au shops and retailers as well as
the status of each region we believe there is room for improvement

ekberg there are plenty of examples where innovations in wrapping and packaging materials
result in more efficient use of truck load capacity but i think there should be joint research across
industries as well as information sharing in the drink manufacturing industry rival companies
are sharing distribution points and distributing each others products to retailers which is
reducing costs along with co2 emissions

kddi in the mobile phone industry cooperative transport between rivals would be difficult to
achieve however in the procurement of products from overseas manufacturers there are
demands to reduce the size of packaging which results in more compact packing and lower
transport and container costs about 20 million items per year move through distribution bases in
japan and we are focused on reducing the number of transport trips

ekberg it is important to have a system that improves the efficiency of the entire group through
the coordination and effective use of each departments goals and expertise in the us major it
companies have introduced carbon offset systems that allow business departments to buy and
sell the co2 that they generate it is a pioneering effort in which you are charged for the amount
of co2 produced in your department and if you can reduce emissions you can sell the surplus
to another department and use the funds to purchase renewable energy

kddi a few years ago when we started doing business with a global mobile phone
manufacturer we experienced the strictness of the worlds environmental specifications prior to
that au had packaged products from all manufacturers in the same type of box but we saw how
global manufacturers were using extremely compact lightweight packaging for shipment by
plane as a consequence since 2009 we have been rapidly reducing the size of boxes and
instruction manuals smartphones are packaged in cardboard and inner boxes and kddi is
working with paper manufacturers and printing companies to further reduce the amount of paper
used instruction manuals and basic information can be viewed with apps or online so paper is
being reduced as more information becomes available electronically

moderator what efforts are being made in terms of product performance

kddi customers place a high priority on battery life so there are demands on manufacturers to
reduce power consumption in the past mobile phones could last for a week on a single battery
charge but with the first generation of smartphones a full battery was not able to last for one day
depending on the customers usage kddi is not involved in the development of batteries but we
are focusing on items such as reducing the amount of power consumed by the apps that we
provide

using smartphones as a tool for solving social issues

moderator nowadays attention is shifting away from csr corporate social responsibility and
toward csv creating shared value factors that resolve social issues through the main business
what do you think about using smartphones as a means to reduce the customers co2
emissions and solve social issues

onoda kddi entered the electric power selling industry and this is the simplest approach for
example kddi can reduce emissions by purchasing and operating on electricity generated at
biomass power plants and other similar sources with mega solar kddi could use the power for
base stations rather than sell it a paradigm shift is now underway in the supply and demand of
electric power and because electricity from electric power companies is expensive many
companies in the manufacturing industry are moving toward sourcing their own electricity for
their factories if you considered delivering information and electricity together you could tie
everything together effectively because kddi is in the mobile business and you have the
infrastructure of cables and base stations there is a low hurdle to entering this field

ekberg from the perspective of csv it is important to generate ideas for example if you think
of the ubiquitous mobile phone as a minigenerator you could devise a system where they could
all be connected together to use as a power source when a major natural disaster occurs this is
similar to how hybrid vehicles can be used to provide power to homes

kddi we havent considered taking this concept of using hybrid vehicles as a power source
and applying it to mobile it might be a good way to expand possibilities

ekberg in africa people use their mobile devices in a variety of ways for example they are
used as flashlights clocks and bank accounts in japan mobile phones were created in a
society overflowing with material goods so only a narrow range of possibilities is considered if
you take the perspective of africa you realize that small devices have great potential

onoda but its also important to think simply efficiency in logistics has immediate
environmental benefits so it should be pursued exhaustively in addition smartphones cannot be
regarded as mature products in terms of their lifecycle so there is plenty of room for
advancement there and most importantly kddi has contact with users so you can exhaustively
gather market opinions and provide feedback to the manufacturers this can serve as a driving
force to reduce costs and improve functionality which can lead to reduced co2 emissions so i
think a straightforward approach is good

kddi we set standards for reducing battery consumption encourage manufacturers to improve
performance and make strong efforts to reduce the energy consumption of powerhungry apps
and hardware as for market opinions we are focused on understanding actual usage in a
variety of terms including overall usage patterns usage by region usage while commuting by
train or car and usage by age group battery consumption varies depending on how long
smartphones are used which apps are used and when and where they are used but by
conducting these types of studies we think we will encounter different topics and approaches
than those of manufacturers

part 2 issues to address in protecting biodiversity

first step is to understand and analyze the positive and negative impacts of business

moderator biodiversity protection spans an extremely broad range of issues and its connection
to business activities is unclear how should we approach this topic

ekberg first you need to figure out how your company impacts biodiversity through the
resources and energy that are used and then analyze and understand the environmental risks
and benefits for example on the positive side advances in it might contribute to the study of
endangered species whereas on the negative side the mining of rare metals used to improve
product performance might threaten the ecosystem particularly with respect to the latter
international regulations on conflict minerals have been strengthened and conferences are
being conducted with the participation of representatives from a variety of industries a topic of
discussion is the establishment of standards and regulations that include the supply chain so i
think that you as a telecommunications company can avoid environmental risks and get some
tips for your efforts by participating in these types of discussions

kddi due to the humanitarian problems surrounding the mining of conflict minerals we at kddi
are examining manufacturers and verifying that these materials are not used in the products that
we purchase there are particularly strict disclosure obligations imposed on manufacturers in the
us so we are bolstering our efforts and paying close attention to the compliance of each
manufacturer

kddi as a positive example of the use of it kddi rd laboratories has been working with
universities and ngos to conduct behavioral studies of the endangered ganges river dolphin
since 2008 the murky river water makes visual observation difficult so an acoustic observation
system is used to monitor the river dolphins population numbers and birth rates as well as their
behavior this data is playing a role in preservation activities

ekberg that is a good example of an activity that makes use of advanced communications
technology biodiversity is regarded as a territory that is far removed from it but to implement
effective protection measures it is essential to obtain basic data for analyzing behavior i think
there is great potential to make contributions in this area

how to contribute to biodiversity protection in our daily lives

onoda it is not making much progress in primary sector industries such as agriculture and
forestry but security companies have recently commercialized warning systems to protect crops
from animals traps for deer boars and monkeys are set up and when an animal is captured
the land manager is notified by email this greatly reduces the amount of work required to
monitor a large area reducing overabundant deer populations preserves the ecosystem and
prevents forest damage which in turn deters natural disasters in addition measures against
problems such as footandmouth disease need to be conducted for each individual animal this
is an opportunity to use it there are many opportunities to provide solutions that address the
problems of each region find out what initially needs to be done to contribute to society and
from there you can discover new topics related to biodiversity

kddi related to this topic kddi has been conducting socalled instruction manual recycling
activities since 2007 at au shops across japan the instruction manuals pamphlets and leaflets
included with mobile phones as well as the paper packaging are accumulated after they are no
longer needed and recycled into envelopes and pamphlets in addition recovered waste paper
is sold to paper companies and the funds are used for forest preservation activities such as
treethinning since 2012 kddi has been using the wood obtained through treethinning
activities to create original novelty products for au mobile phone users such as smartphone
stands desktop calendars and wood coasters wood has also been donated to bus stations in
the city of kamaishi in iwate prefecture in the future we will continue our instruction manual

recycling activities as a way to contribute to forest preservation in japan

onoda if you approach things with an eye on the monumental issue of biodiversity it is difficult
to see the connection to daily activities however if you think of the wood from treethinning
activities you think of mountains and if you think of mountains you think this is where base
stations are located and this is connected to the local society for undersea cables there is a
deep connection to the fishing industry it is good to make contributions through technology but if
you consider the perspective of regions where there is everyday contact the entrance becomes
even wider you can also support regions by introducing local specialty products through
smartphones buying in bulk and making individual purchases if employees can adopt this
attitude in their relationships to regions the kddi group can bring a lot of power with its size i
think this can create new new opportunities and collaborations and in a roundabout way lead to
biodiversity protection

kddi it is comforting to think that simply purchasing local specialty goods can lead to
biodiversity protection the entire question of how to contribute to biodiversity is difficult to grasp
the environmental awareness of our employees changed with the opportunity to do business
with global manufacturers mentioned earlier but along with that type of external stimulation we
need a system that encourages us to always think of what we can do and which fosters
awareness

ekberg as an example from the perspective of education there is a financial institution that
participates actively in volunteer activities which has achieved positive results by establishing a
system that rewards employees who offer good ideas in addition there is an it device
manufacturer that established a project that recruits volunteers to discover business chances
from social issues in developing countries the project has invigorated their company by helping
them rediscover their own potential and by leading to the creation of a training program that
dispatches employees from japan to the sites

kddi thank you very much in todays enlightening discussion we heard some innovative
suggestions from a variety of angles and perspectives along with plenty of case examples to
the employees who attended this session we hope you can take these ideas back to your
departments and raise awareness we encourage you to reevaluate and delve deeper into your
efforts and work toward setting goals and creating schemes for new projects

aiming to solve social issues  csv initiatives
   establishment of csv conference

approaches to csv that include not only conventional social contribution activities such as
donations and volunteer activities but also efforts to solve social issues through business
activities are receiving attention around the world
in june 2013 kddi established a csv 1 conference for the purpose of spreading csv
awareness within the company

the csv conference is administered by the csr  environment management department and
includes the participation of 14 managementlevel officers from 12 business divisions including
the rd strategy division corporate strategy planning division service planning division and
kddi rd laboratories

1 csv is a business concept that aims to create both social and corporate value by solving social issues
    through corporate business activities


   csv conference activities

in fy2013 five conference sessions were held from june to september in which basic csv

   comments from outside experts



this time i was fortunate to serve as a facilitator we conducted a lively
discussion and heard suggestions on topics covering three major social
issues i felt that the opportunity for participants to share various
perspectives from different business departments made this an extremely
fruitful occasion communications networks can bring together value from
various distant places and this can lead to real interaction and trade i am
convinced that this is the csv direction that kddi should aim for

i was invited to the second csv conference to discuss key issues involved
in csv efforts all participants from the various business divisions across
the organization were highly motivated and i felt that the culture of
embracing the challenge of the unknown is a strength for kddi

in new business creation it is essential to have a clear commitment from
top management environment and social contracts tie the hands of
existing businesses but a change in perspective can lead to business
opportunities i hope that management maintains a strong will and kddi
uses its unique perspective to make bold efforts

sponsorship and participation in conference on csr and risk
management
   sponsorship and participation in exclusive session on human rights due diligence

in the second half of the 20th century corporations in
developed nations became increasingly multinational
while developing countries experienced growing
problems with environmental pollution and illegal labor
practices these problems have come to be
recognized as a global issue which has led to a
growing social awareness of corporate social
responsibility and sustainability that includes the value
chain consequently human rights due diligence
which involves the continuous implementation of participants in exclusive session 22 people from 18
measures to identify evaluate prevent and redress companies
any human rights risks linked to a companys business
activities has recently been receiving attention in japan at kddi the human rights of every
stakeholder are recognized as an important issue

as part of the response to these issues kddi sponsored and participated in the conference on
csr and risk management organized by caux round table japan and the united nations
working group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other
business enterprises in september 2013 at the conference discussions were held on how
corporations should address human rights due diligence issues through csr risk management

a seminar was held on the guiding principles for implementation of the un protection respect
and remedy framework for business and human rights which are incorporated in various
csr guidelines as an effective tool for implementing csr risk management the speaker who
is a member of the united nations working group on the issue of human rights and
transnational corporations and other business enterprises which is tasked with putting the
framework into practice offered concrete advice on applying the guiding principles to csr risk
for corporations


role of corporations in human rights

in a lecture on the guiding principles on business and human rights informally known as the
ruggie report which were endorsed by the united nations in 2011 participants learned a key
principle which states human rights are the inalienable fundamental rights to which a person is
inherently entitled simply because he or she is a human being therefore human rights due
diligence and risk management should not be implemented for the purpose of hedging business
continuity risks instead of idealistic theory the lecture covered what is required in actual
practice such as the minimum actions that are necessary to avoid human rights infringements
which are integral to the corporate responsibility to respect human rights

establishing a framework for human rights risks

the workshop included a discussion of a hypothetical case study about what happens when a
business partner in the supply chain commits serious human rights violations as well as what
actions an outsourcer can take in response to that business partner and what the maximum
risks are for the outsourcer


maximum risks                                          envisioned kpis

 no right to collective bargaining                     productivity improvement
 no trade unions                                       operation delay rate
 use of child labor                                    number of grievances of employees
 routine use of lowwage labor                         number of work accidents
 healthdamaging work environment                      employee turnover rate
 poor accidentprone work environment                 number of dialogues with management
etc                                                    wage gap
                                                       etc



business partners countermeasures that are unique to japan

the workshop also discussed the countermeasures that should be taken if the business partner
in the previous example does not heed the demands of the outsourcer regarding the human
rightsholders the business partners workers opinions such as those below were expressed
    work with other outsourcers to pressure the business partner into engaging with the human
     rightsholders
    request the cooperation of ngos to investigate the business partner and conduct
     interviews with the human rightsholders
    open a help line from the outsourcer to the human rightsholders and conduct interviews
     directly
    visit the factory where the human rightsholders work and have ngos conduct interviews
     with the human rightsholders
    publish details of the above activities on the company website to communicate the business
     partners human rights violations as broadly as possible
another opinion that was expressed was to hold talks with the business partner instead of
simply trying to break off the relationship and work together to make progress participants from
the un praised this opinion and remarked that the perspective was unique to japan and had not
come up in previous workshops held in other countries


   future issues for kddi

by participating in un human rights workshops in countries around the world kddi has studied
international comparisons and different observations related to respecting human rights and
avoiding complicity in human rights violations at kddi we are conducting incompany
workshops on human rights issues with the recognition that we need to communicate what is
now required of us as a global corporation

they want to keep their children safe they are concerned about overuse and the possibility of
getting into trouble via the internet

mamorino3 au mobile phones for children

kddi sells mamorino au mobile phones for children in the
lower grades of elementary school as a way of keeping them
safe in march 2011 we launched the mamorino2 and in
january 2013 the mamorino3
mamorino phones are a recommended product of the
national congress of parents and teachers association of
japan and the national federation of kodomokai 2 and
are supported by many parents
mamorino3 phones only allow calls and mails to and from a
maximum of 10 registered people rejecting calls and mails
from unregistered phones and automatically send
gpsbased location information at fixed times parents can
also use the anshin navi system to check where their
children are at any time and the phones can receive
emergency rapid mail and use disaster message boards
and emergency voicemail services there is an additional mamorino3
service whereby when the security buzzer goes off it
automatically alerts secom co ltd and an employee

introduced in accordance with these guidelines the radio radiation protection guidelines are
equivalent to international guidelines advocated by the world health organization who and
were created to keep electromagnetic radiation within a range ensuring an adequate safety ratio
in accordance with the results of international research experts from who and other

threat to safety in order to ensure this we design build maintain and periodically inspect our
mobile phone base stations in strict compliance with the relevant laws and regulations including
the radio radiation protection guidelines stipulated in the radio law and the building
standards law as well as local government ordinances

   introducing 4g ltecompatible widezone base station for disasters

in preparation for an earthquake occurring directly beneath
the tokyo metropolitan area kddi is reviewing its disaster
measures from various perspectives and as a backup for the
time between when an earthquake strikes and recovery we
have introduced a widezone base station for disasters
installation began in april 2013 and was completed on
february 26 2014 when the station was brought into
operation the base station supports voice communication           one of the widezone base station antennas
1x 3g communication evdo and lte communication 4g            on the roof of kddi office building shinjuku
lte allowing provision of mobile phone services such as
voice calls and data transmission should an earthquake
directly hit the capital it is the first 4g ltecompatible
widezone base station in japan

ten base stations have been constructed covering an area
from chiba in chiba prefecture to the east to kawaguchi in
saitama prefecture to the north tachikawa in tokyo to the
west and kawasaki in kanagawa prefecture furthermore radio transmission path relay station
learning from the experience of the great east japan
earthquake the backhaul line connected to the core network in the widezone base station has
a dual structure of microwave radio and fiber optic cable

we will study widezone base stations based on damage assumptions in each region of japan in
the event of disaster not just in the tokyo area


   chikura no2 cable landing station safe from effects of tsunami

as a bcp measuresrelated project based on the draft basic law to make japan more resilient
against disasters promoted by the cabinet office kddi has established a new cable landing
station in minami boso city chiba prefecture that will not be impacted by tsunami the chikura
no2 cable landing station is an elevated station located 28m above sea level based on the
assumption of the highest tsunami in the chikura area announced by the government so it will
not be affected by any tsunami that may occur
in addition to submarine fiber optic cables linking japan with america and asia as part of our
international communications network bcp kddi will utilize cable routes to europe via russia
and satellite networks in this way kddi will continue to strive to provide safe and secure
communications services by ensuring the continuity of international communications in times of
disaster

conducting demonstration experiments on shipboard base stations

in november 2012 we conducted a shipboard test aboard
the patrol vessel kurose in the city of kure hiroshima
prefecture in cooperation with the ministry of internal affairs
and       communications           chugoku       bureau       of
telecommunications and the japan coast guard this
demonstration experiment involved installing a mobile phone
base station and satellite communications equipment on the
kurose and checking voice and data communications
between land and sea radio waves sent from the ships
mobile phone base station were received in the coastal area satellite antenna inside the cylindrical cover
                                                                   toward the bow of the patrol vessel kurose
and we tested voice and data communications to see how source study team for shipboard

confirm its practical applicability to evacuation centers on high ground facing the sea and verify
the effectiveness of different communication systems frequency antenna etc learning from
its experiences during the great east japan earthquake kddi has been working on measures
to quickly restore coverage in its service area following a disaster by transmission from the
ocean which is not affected by disaster conditions on land


au disaster recovery support system

kddi has implemented an au disaster recovery support system in 10 technical centers
nationwide to quickly grasp the situation and draw up precise recovery plans if a largescale
disaster takes place

the au disaster recovery support system comprehensively manages the overall area situation
based on equipment malfunction information the situation in key locations based on data traffic
and information related to emergency shelters and evacuation routes by plotting this data on a
map it is possible to understand priority recovery areas visually and in real time

even if a disaster affects a wide area the system makes possible effective recovery activity also
by using it as a means to exchange information with government institutions and internal
departments it can be used not only to restore communications infrastructure but also as a
useful tool for supporting general disaster recovery

to quickly restore communications to service areas in case of outage such as due to a disaster
we are pursuing equipmentbased measures including increases in vehiclemounted base
stations portable base stations and radio entrance circuits 1 we are also bolstering
personnelbased measures to ensure this equipment is used effectively

participation in nationwide disaster response training

as a designated public institution under the basic act on disaster countermeasures kddi
participates in comprehensive disaster response training held by the national and local
governments and as a provider of information communications infrastructure we cooperate with
relevant authorities to ensure rapid and effective recovery activities

in disaster readiness week in 2013 the week that included disaster readiness day
september 1 we took an active part in disaster response training held by local governments in
different areas throughout japan to increase awareness and knowledge of what to do if a

reinforcement of equipment for reconstruction of network and quick recovery

kddi is targeting improved network reliability and implementing
various initiatives to prepare for the kind of largescale disaster it
is feared may take place such as an earthquake directly
underneath the tokyo metropolitan area or a massive earthquake
in the nankai trough tokai tonankai nankai

as part of efforts to build disasterresistant networks we have
augmented our backbone networks from three routes to four and
furthermore we have installed a new facility monitoring system in
kansai to decentralize our monitoring functions

also as a facilities measure to allow quick recovery in disasterhit
areas we augmented deployment of mobile power supply
vehicles and emergency power generators to make possible
quick power supply to telecommunications facilities in the
disaster area furthermore we are implementing various
initiatives to ensure communications services in the disasterhit vehiclemounted base station
areas such as increasing deployment of emergency radio
entrance facilities 2 as well as vehiclemounted and portable base stations and equipping
around 2000 mobile phone base stations with batteries capable of operation for more than 24
hours

apart from their usage in times of disaster vehiclemounted base stations are used as a
measure for handling increased traffic at fireworks festivals outdoor events and other times
when a large number of customers are concentrated in a small area in july 2013 to allow for
even faster communications we upgraded our vehiclemounted base stations for compatibility
with the nextgeneration highspeed data communications standard 4g lte

useful services in times of disaster

when a disaster happens many people try to use their
phones simultaneously making voice communications
difficult for this reason we have begun offering a variety of
new services that people can use to communicate or check
the safety of loved ones after a disaster we are also
enhancing our emergency rapid mail to provide tsunami
warnings as well as useful information in times of disaster

to ensure use in times of disaster au disaster
countermeasures apps is preset on au smartphones
android currently on the market an iphone version is
also available from the app store

au countermeasures measure apps combines a variety of au disaster countermeasures app
services that can be used when a disaster occurs including
the disaster message board for registering and confirming safety in the event of disaster
emergency rapid mail for directly sending disasterrelated information such as emergency
earthquake early warnings tsunami warnings and disasterevacuation information 3 and the
disaster voice messaging service for conveying spoken confirmation of safety through use of
the packet communications network in times of disaster furthermore preinitialization enables
registration of safety information and sending of voice files from wifi and use of mobile phone
data transmission lines when voice transmission is interrupted
we have also begun an arrangement allowing mutual usage of the disaster message board and
disaster voice messaging service between all mobile phone providers that transcends company

business continuity plan bcp initiatives

following our experiences in the march 2011 great east
japan earthquake we established a companywide disaster
response project and in october 2011 we formulated a
business continuity plan bcp for largescale disasters
we are pursuing a host of measures to address the plans
objectives of ensuring the safety of employees and their
families and fulfilling our responsibilities to continue
providing telecommunications services as a designated
public institution specifically we have established detailed
rules for each phase of response to disaster from initial disaster response training connecting the
action through to full restoration we are also creating satellite communications
                                                                   throughout japan

network links to principal bases throughout japan in
preparation for a scenario in which all fixedline and mobile circuits cease to function we have
identified personnel who will in the event of a disaster be dispatched quickly to provide support
at emergency shelters and have stockpiled the equipment necessary for this eventuality in
addition with these measures to shore up our structure we are proactively conducting disaster
response training throughout japan that focuses on initial disaster response

in february 2014 the disaster response office spearheaded efforts by countermeasure offices
to link communications equipment from all divisions and branches throughout japan as part of
disaster response training in anticipation of an earthquake directly underneath the tokyo
metropolitan area as well as employing a completely blind method of training in which
participants are not told what sort of disaster to expect until just before the training begins
training was conducted assuming total disruption of communications immediately after the
disaster with the disaster response meeting held under a communication environment consisting
of satellite network only
the training was held for approximately 260 emergency participants at the start of the training
they responded as information about the disaster began to unravel and considered new damage
assumptions that were disclosed as time went on lending the training a sense of reality

we will reflect in future bcp the issues and areas for improvement that became apparent as a
result of this training building the foundations for more robust disaster response going forward
based on the guidelines for taking action against an influenza pandemic february 2009
council on countermeasures related to a new strain of influenza and avian influenza we
formulated the plan for maintaining companywide operations in the event of an outbreak of a
new strain of influenza to ensure employee health and accurate responses so that we can
continue to provide our customers with communications services in the event of an outbreak of a

   using twitter to provide active support

the proliferation of smartphones and the surge in use of social networking services sns 3 
has enabled customers to express their dissatisfaction via tweets and made them increasingly
visible
realizing that it is becoming more difficult to provide support that satisfies customers through
telephone inquiries and consultations at au shops we use twitter  a particularly prolific sns 
to provide active support by proactively searching for problems one approach that has led to
helping us to resolve issues among customers who tweet but in an offhand manner without
really intending to ask for help has been to respond with our own tweet saying we saw your
tweet we may be able to help you so could you provide us with more details using an open
forum like sns allows us to simultaneously address areas that many people may find
inconvenient or dissatisfying we have received strong positive feedback outside of the company

assessments lca of its products and services to determine the amount of co2 generated at
each stage of operations from manufacturing and use to disposal or recycling 1 in fy2008 and
fy2012 we conducted lca on au hikari and au kddi plans to continue its efforts to
determine and disclose the environmental impact of its products and services as part of its
initiatives toward achieving a lowcarbon society

promoting green procurement

kddi formulated kddi green procurement guidelines to promote purchasing of more
environmentfriendly products and since april 2010 we have procured business equipment
communications devices air conditioning systems power supply facilities etc with high
energysaving performance the guidelines set standards for 29 kinds of equipment of which
the standards for 10 kinds of equipment are based on guidelines specified by the ict ecology

portable batteries

in fy2013 kddi introduced and utilizes portable batteries with
reduced environmental impact at five maintenance bases throughout
japan as a substitute for the mobile power supply vehicles used in
the past to power au mobile phone base stations during electricity
outages in the portable battery trial conducted in fy2012 assuming
a power outage of approximately 10 hours per base station and
wireless device power consumption of 1kw whereas a mobile power
supply vehicle would consume 82 liters per time equivalent to
215kg of co2 emissions a portable battery required 10kwh per
time equivalent to 41kg of co2 emissions given this 174kg
difference in co2 emissions we expect an approximate 80
reduction in emissions compared with mobile power supply vehicles
kddi plans to expand the number of portable batteries introduced in
readiness for the future increase in base stations and to continue to   portable batteries

using natural energy

in order to actualize even better energy conservation and co2
emissions cuts at kddi a portion of the electric power used at large
scale communications stations like the yamaguchi technical service
center oyama network center no 2 and tokyo technical center
and almost all electrical power at seven mobile telephone base
stations including hokkaido and aomori come from natural energy
sources such as solar power
we have been making progress in introducing renewable energy large scale communications station
establishing 100 tribrid base stations base stations utilizing tribrid using natural energy
electric power control technology to efficiently supply three kinds of
electric power  ordinary commercial power power generated by solar panels and midnight
power saved in storage batteries  according to the time of day and changes in the weather
throughout japan

renewable energy

kddi launched its solar power generation business on november 18 2013 with the aim of
contributing to reduction of co2 emissions we constructed solar power generation facilities on
some idle land owned by kddi in three locations around the country and we sell the power
generated to electric power companies based on the feedin tariff scheme for renewable
energy total power generation total power sales in fy2013 amounted to 3034mwh

reducing power consumption in base stations and undertaking disaster measure initiatives

the dense blanket of au mobile phone base stations covering
japan accounts for 60 of the total energy consumed by kddi
and reducing the power that base stations consume is a
topmost priority furthermore 77 of the base stations that
ceased to operate in the aftermath of the great east japan
earthquake that struck in march 2011 in six tohoku
prefectures as of march 12 2011 did so because of power
outages clearly disaster preparedness measures that
address power outages are a pressing topic
in regard to these issues kddi has promoted initiatives
combining reduction of environmental impact and disaster
preparedness measures by increasing the number of tribrid
base stations and extending the life of base station batteries to
24 hours
tribrid base stations are base stations that employ tribrid tribrid base station
power control technology to determine which of three types of power to use depending on the
time of day and changes in the weather tribrid power control involves the use of technology to
efficiently control the source of electric power by the hour combining typical commercial electric
power with generation from solar panels and charging batteries with nighttime power compared
with base stations that only use conventional electric power tribrid base stations have been
proved to reduce co2 emissions by as much as 30 a year as of march 31 2014 100 tribrid
base stations were installed throughout japan
furthermore serving as backup in case power is interrupted kddi has installed batteries with
life extended to 24 hours focusing on prefectural and municipal government offices and train
stations serving more than 100000 passengers per day as of march 31 2014 extended life
batteries have been installed at 2200 base stations throughout japan

  a video about the advancement of tribrid base stations is available for viewing
  rd related to adaptive utilization technology for limited network resources in the event of
  disaster

voice first female director at kddi was created on april 1 2014

what kickstarted my career plan
when i first joined the company i wasnt careerminded but a turning point
came when i switched to the managerial track and the personnel manager
talked about women working in management positions after that i was
inspired by the opportunities provided by my boss to interact with female
executives in other companies and in the process of building a network
with various women working outside the company i started to think about
my own career plan i am grateful to my boss and my colleagues at kddi            nanae saishouji
for creating so many opportunities for me                                        director corporate
                                                                                  management division and
                                                                                  general manager

cultivation of female managers
women have such a strong sense of responsibility that sometimes they cannot act boldly
because they are too concerned about the impact on people around them i feel that the boss or
the company is required to give such women a push forward i dont particularly think about
gender but i make a point of creating as many opportunities as possible for premanagerial
employees to develop good judgment and dont just require work perfection often i do not
want to let outstanding human assets go but i also think that welltimed personnel transfers are
necessary for the sake of the persons career and optimization of the companys human assets

people as they are unable to grasp the content of meetings or briefings at
which many people voice their opinions three employees with hearing
difficulties participated in the creation of this guide discussing alternate
methods of sharing information other than ears just as no two people have
the same fingerprints so no two people have the same hearing disability

experiences of people in otsuchi

oraga otsuchi yume hiroba

we requested that kddi get involved not only in the
reformation of old japanesestyle homes but also in
postactivity workshops in these workshops we all sit in a
circle and discuss what we learned from the experience of
participating in the activity sometimes our discussions about
the future of the town last until late into the night the town
residents who participate range from elderly people living in
temporary housing to high school students and people in the
fishing industry among the things that we have come to
understand through these workshops are the merits of the
town that we ourselves sometimes fail to notice one reason        kazuyuki usuzawa
for this is that things that we residents simply take for granted director oraga otsuchi yume hiroba
are seen as important assets by people who come in from
cities one of the important tasks before us is using this information to create a vision of our
future



new otsuchi fishing cooperative

before the disaster otsuchi was a fishing town where salmon ran upstream it boasted a fishing
ground in which the oyashio and kuroshio converge along its
ria coastline which is unique to the sanriku region before the
disaster the total value of its annual catch was 11 billion but
the devastating effects the disaster had on this industry led to
the de facto bankruptcy of the fishing cooperative and the
drastic reduction in the number of producers the scallop
cultivation cooperative 10 members including myself is
working hard under these conditions to reconstruct this fishing
town we want everyone in japan to be able to enjoy                 shuichi koshida

   1 points on which to be commended

for the past two years kddi has published the csr  annual report as an integrated report
and has been reporting on csr activities this year in addition to publishing the integrated
report which includes esg information required by institutional investors who were the main
readers of previous annual reports a separate sustainability report was published which
includes a wide range of csr information for a broad variety of stakeholders including
consumers this approach more effectively clarifies who the target readers are
the sustainability report was created with a strong focus on readability and intelligibility the
report communicates the kddi philosophy which expresses the ideal attitudes and values of
kddi with its 40 million users along with efforts to implement these attitudes and values in the
real world the intent to convey these concepts to all relevant parties in a clear and
easytounderstand manner is evident in the report
the 8 stories presented at the beginning are emblematic of this approach the stories
document the efforts made by employees in a variety of fields and the topics include the
evolution of kddis role away from providing support to venture companies and toward
connecting them with major corporations their efforts to use cuttingedge sound technology in
biodiversity protection their reconstruction support in the form of temporary assignments to local
governments and their sensible and practical emergency drills aimed at maintaining continuous
communications in a crisis all of these topics are interesting and the discussion of the thinking
behind the implementation of these activities gave me the impression that kddi is striving for
connecting feelings connecting happy smiling faces the kind of company we want to
become in the kddi philosophy simply by reading these highlights readers can get an
understanding of the broad diversity of kddis engagement with society
in addition with the description of business activities and social responsibilities in kddis
approach to csr this year the csr activities are organized into those that support business
and those that are implemented through business this more effectively clarifies the efforts that
kddi is making to fulfill its social responsibilities in the value chain
as for the annual report on csr activities seven material issues are spotlighted in the csr
targets achievements and issues table again this year and a detailed description of the
activities for each issue are reported on the subsequent pages by incorporating these issues
into the table it is possible to review the activities and understand the status of their yeartoyear
progress i think this is useful for the ongoing efforts to improve the activities
in the activities report i was impressed with the quality of the labor practices description in
terms of kddis ongoing diversity promotion activities i am impressed with their continuous
efforts to effectively raise awareness their activities such as seminars that educate participants
on lgbt issues and their attitude of quickly engaging on generally unfamiliar topics in addition
with respect to stakeholder engagement kddis establishment of a csv conference this year
along with their sponsorship and participation in international meetings hosted by organizations
such as united nations working groups expanded their range of activities while they engaged
in efforts on global issues

   2 areas for improvement

companies are motivated to do whatever it takes to achieve the performance objectives in terms
of sales and the number of contracts but there is also a similar need for the dedication to
achieve the company philosophy company dedication when there is company dedication the
specific judgments and instructions of the superiors have a significant influence on the actions of
each individual employee toward achieving the philosophy influence of superiors in the
direction that the company is aiming for the motivation of the company as a whole can be
maximized when individual employees experience a sense of reward through their work and
realize their dreams and hopes affinity toward the company
in addition to promoting the further spread of the updated kddi philosophy within japan and
abroad i hope that kddi will demonstrate the power of ict that establishes bonds between
people companies and society above and beyond their basic mission of providing stable
communications services i also hope the company will contribute to the resolution of social
issues and do whatever it takes to succeed in their efforts for connecting feelings connecting
happy smiling faces and delivering excitement beyond surprise to customers as promoted
in the kddi philosophy



our response to the thirdparty opinion

in this years report we included 8 stories that highlight the actual
efforts of individual employees the aim of this section is to
communicate our efforts in the workplace in an easytounderstand
manner to customers who are stakeholders
we are extremely pleased to receive a positive evaluation from ms

as we proceed to spread the new kddi philosophy which serves as the
philosophical foundation for our csr activities within japan and abroad
