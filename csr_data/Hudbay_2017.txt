hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                2

                  commodities advance and commodities decline
                demand and prices were both low for much of 2016
                 thats the nature of mining as a company hudbay
                    focuses on what we can control  efficiency
                 sustainability and productivity  so when the cycle
                turns were positioned to capitalize on it thats the
                                  nature of hudbay



to succeed during a down cycle hudbay draws on internal resources including
 experience expertise and a companywide commitment to controlling costs
                  while getting the most out of every mine


      to keep building strong community relations we operate safely and
    sustainably while making sure that the communities near our operations
                 participate in the benefits of a wellrun mine


 at every mine in every jurisdiction we make sustainability and responsibility
                        just as important as production




hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                                  1

                                                dealing with the inevitable
                                                managing price cyclicality




the ebb and flow of demand  and the rise and fall of prices  have always been part of mining this means
that hudbay has been successfully managing price cycles in the metals markets for close to 90 years that
history combined with the experience of our leadership team provided useful perspective and insight
throughout the low copper price environment of the last few years

when hudbay incorporated in 1927 our operations were based in manitoba and our primary market was
north america today our company is international and our market is global over the last 10 years demand
for copper was largely driven by economic and industrial growth in china in recent years chinas economy
has slowed and growth in the worlds other major markets has also been largely muted

at the same time as a result of investment earlier in the decade a number of new sources of copper 
including our constancia mine  came on stream and global production grew as a natural consequence of
increased supply and slower demand growth the price for copper dropped hitting a multiyear low in
january 2016

we responded to these events by focusing our efforts where we could make a difference  on improving
efficiencies strengthening our balance sheet and managing costs at all of our operations

as alan hair hudbays president and chief executive officer observed at the companys yearend town hall
staff meeting we began january with copper at a multiyear low price and the upside of 2016 is how the
organization responded we delivered cost reductions at our operations while still meeting guidance we
also restructured our credit facilities positioning the company for an even tougher pricing environment
than turned out to be the case most importantly we showed we could weather the storm while still moving
forward

toward the end of the year the copper price improved and our focus on cost control and generating cash
flow from operations meant we were able to begin devoting resources to plans for growth and exploration
unlike many in the copper sector hudbay had maintained core exploration teams our capacity to respond
effectively to nearterm challenges while continuing to build and plan for the long term is the key to
delivering positive performance

                                                 a foundation for rewarding
                                                 community relationships




mining is of tremendous importance to peru in 2015 it accounted for 176 of the countrys gdp and
roughly half of its exports mining brings tax revenue jobs investment infrastructure and other important
benefits understandably it can also prompt questions and concern from local communities

in 2016 our constancia mine saw a protest march a roadblock and a brief occupation for safety reasons
the occupation led to a temporary suspension of operations the occupiers were from communities that had
all signed cooperation and development agreements with hudbay and with local and national governments
for various reasons they were dissatisfied with the scope of the agreements and the pace of their
implementation  and they voiced their concerns through protests such as these which are commonly
employed tactics in rural and outlying districts of peru

with forbearance and discipline from all sides both legitimate protest and civil disobedience can be resolved
peacefully as were the three actions around constancia however we know it doesnt always happen this
way in peru and we work very hard to maintain good relationships with our neighbours and mitigate
potential issues we do so with the understanding that points of difference arise even in the best
relationships the key to maintaining those relationships is regular and open communication and on both
sides a willingness to consider other points of view

our constancia operations have more than 17 people who focus on engaging with communities and
supporting development they keep our neighbours informed about what were doing and why while
making sure we understand and acknowledge their concerns they also work with local communities on
projects to improve infrastructure upgrade health facilities and build capacity for sustainable economic
development and growth

                                                  managing our impact and
                                                  supporting biodiversity




nothing better defines the nature of modern mining than the commitment to operating in accordance with
the principles of environmental responsibility and sustainability an example of this commitment can be
seen every day in the handson practical steps hudbay takes to foster biodiversity

in many cases our steps are framed out in protocols established by organizations like the mining association
of canada mac the international standards organization iso and the international finance corporation
ifc while the guidelines and standards set by these outside organizations play a key part in helping us be a
responsible operator the drive to meet them comes from inside our organization

people who dont know the industry might be surprised to discover the extensive effort companies and
employees make to ensure our activities are compatible with surrounding ecosystems in addition to miners
and engineers we employ and partner with biologists botanists ecologists and environmental scientists
they understand industrys part in societys overall impact on the environment but they also recognize that
sustainable mining can contribute to enhancing the quality of life around the world and they are dedicated
to making sure that hudbay meets high standards for environmental performance

in our approach to conserving biodiversity were guided by the mitigation hierarchy a series of defined
steps taken throughout the life of a project that help limit the adverse impacts of a development on
biodiversity and can potentially lead to a net gain here are a few examples

  in peru were gathering breeding relocating and releasing two threatened animal species an aquatic
  frog in conservation status and an endemic reptile from the region to similar habitats outside of the mine
  site were also working with members of local communities near our operations to preserve and restore
  wetlands including helping area ranchers identify practical alternatives when it comes to finding places
  for feeding and watering their cattle

  in manitoba we have an ongoing partnership with manitoba sustainable development formerly
  manitoba conservation to help ensure that the local caribou populations are not adversely impacted by
  our operations we consulted with manitoba sustainable development during the planning stages of our
  reed and lalor mines to make our activities as cariboufriendly as possible and we continue to provide
  financial and practical support to help them monitor caribou populations

  in arizona we will be funding a variety of mitigation measures including aquatic and bird species
  conservation activities salvaging and replanting agave plants that are a food source for an endangered
  bat avoiding specific sites to prevent plant species impacts implementing jaguar and ocelot monitoring
  programs as well as providing financial support to the forest service to hire a biologist for the term of
  conservation to manage funds and monitor results

biodiversity conservation is integral to modern mining and one of the cornerstones of our approach to
building a business that is sustainable and successful

our company
ceo message
2016 is perhaps best described as a year of two halves

in the first half of the year the copper price went from bad to worse and virtually every mining company saw close
scrutiny and tough questions about its balance sheet and liquidity at hudbay we took decisive action to reduce
discretionary spending while maintaining above all else our focus on safety

from a safetyfirst starting point we deferred capital expenditures we worked wherever possible with our banks
and other sources of finance to restructure our credit facilities and we ensured that we had clear plans in place to
weather any further turbulence in commodity prices

during the second half thanks to strong business performance and an improving price environment toward the end
of the year we were in a position to move the business forward this included reintroducing certain growth
initiatives such as incorporating pampacancha into the constancia mine plan as of the end of 2018 working to
expand operations at lalor further advancing permitting at rosemont and looking at exploration opportunities in
chile

for all of the challenges i can confidently say that in 2016 hudbay met both its performance and strategic goals and
positioned the company for growth in 2017 and beyond




                                              copper and zinc are essential elements
                                              for modern life mobile devices medicine
                                              housing transportation and renewable
                                              energy all draw on these natural
                                              resources and demand will increase as
                                              global production declines


disciplined performance
in 2016 constancia completed its ramp up to full production delivering exceptional results with copper and
precious metals production exceeding the high end of the 2016 guidance range

importantly our south america business unit and the team at constancia worked closely with communities in the
area of our operations and transportation routes by keeping the lines of communication open striving to mitigate
any minerelated impacts that concern communities and ensuring those communities benefit from our activities the
team made an essential contribution to our successful results in peru the foundation theyve built with our
neighbours and in the region was instrumental in helping us overcome many of the challenges encountered this past
year

our three mines in manitoba  lalor reed and 777  met their production guidance goals for 2016 as well during
the year we welcomed andré lauzon as the new head of the manitoba business unit andré has worked in mines all
around the world and we benefit from his long experience and fresh perspective he immediately began working to
improve overall productivity in manitoba with a particular focus on ways to increase production at lalor




hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                                                                        7

andré is also tasked to lead the business unit through an inevitable phase of mining closure exploration has not
revealed any alternatives that could extend the life of the 777 mine which is expected to close in 2020 or the reed
mine which will close as anticipated in 2018 were working with the communities and government representatives
of flin flon creighton and denare beach as they prepare for the mines closures we also launched a collaborative
effort with employees to explore ways to sustain operations at the flin flon zinc plant which will be affected by the
reduced ore feed in the flin flon area

at our arizona business unit pat merrin and his team continued to move the rosemont project through permitting
during 2016 rosemont received the final biological opinion from the us fish and wildlife service a key step toward
receiving final federal permits additionally legal challenges relating to the project were resolved with rulings that
upheld both regulatory decisions and our understanding of applicable regulations in our experience permitting is
not a process for the impatient but we know that it supports the construction and operation of a good mine

looking ahead
copper and zinc are essential elements for modern life mobile devices medicine housing transportation and
renewable energy all draw on these natural resources and demand will increase as global production declines

within this context hudbay has distinct strengths constancia and lalor are lowcost longterm properties still in
the early stages of their operating lives offering strong growth potential rosemont can significantly increase our
copper production and be a showcase for sustainable mining hudbay has proven capabilities as a mine builder and
operator and we are proud of our record of managing costs and delivering results the positive response to our bond
issue in december 2016 proves that the market shares this opinion

hudbay enters 2017 having met or exceeded all of our production and operating guidance for 2016 our balance
sheet is stronger and we are positioned to both pursue and deliver growth in the year ahead regardless of where
the mining cycle may be hudbay its operations and its people are well positioned for the future

in closing i would like to thank the board and my colleagues at hudbay for their continued support and
commitment throughout the year and across the company we identified our goals and pulled together to achieve
them thats the nature of hudbay

sincerely

business and financial review
strategy
hudbays mission is to create sustainable value for our shareholders through acquiring developing and operating
highquality longlife deposits with exploration potential in miningfriendly jurisdictions

long experience has taught us the best way to create shareholder value in the mining sector is through discovering
new mineral deposits and then developing the facilities to mine those deposits profitably we believe the successful
development rampup and operation of our constancia mine in peru and our many decades of experience of mining
in northern manitoba give hudbay a competitive edge relative to our peers

we plan to grow the company by exploring and developing properties we already control like our rosemont project
in arizona we may also acquire other properties that align with our strategic criteria and we continually work to
optimize the value of our producing assets through efficient and safe operations

to make sure we deliver shareholder value with our acquisitions our criteria for evaluating every opportunity
includes the following

   potential acquisitions should be in politically stable miningfriendly jurisdictions in the americas

   we must be able to leverage our expertise in exploring and developing volcanogenic massive sulphide and
   porphyry mineral deposits

   we look for assets that offer significant potential for exploration development and optimization

   large transformational mergers or acquisitions in the mining industry tend to be risky and potentially value
   destructive so unless exceptional opportunities present themselves we generally focus on specific highquality
   low cost long life mines development projects and earlystage projects

   before any acquisition we make sure we understand how we can add value to the property by applying our social
   technical operational and project execution expertise or through providing the required financial capacity and
   other optimization opportunities

   acquisitions should be accretive to hudbay on a per share basis

financial and business objectives for 2017
   continue pursuing efficiency improvements in our operations so we can sustain the cost reductions achieved in
   2016 while generating incremental free cash flow and increasing net asset value

   move ahead on highreturn inhouse brownfield opportunities to increase throughput from the lalor mine and
   related milling facilities and to incrementally add zinc and gold production in the near and medium term

   advance the development of the highgrade pampacancha deposit so that we can begin mining it in late 2018

   advance permitting and technical work at the rosemont project

   use free cash flow generation to reduce debt and further reduce our cost of capital

   continue to evaluate exploration and acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria and pursue those that we
   feel are in the best interest of the company and our stakeholders

business and financial review
operations
in 2016 we focused on making our operations even more cost efficient while still achieving strong production
results and maintaining our longstanding priority and focus on safety our efforts were rewarded both with positive
free cash flow generation in a year of cyclical low copper prices and by successfully meeting or surpassing our
strategic and performance goals as the pricing environment improved over the year hudbay ended 2016 in a strong
position to pursue organic growth at existing operations and to consider exploration opportunities in chile

2016 performance highlights
  increased production of all metals yearoveryear reflecting the first full year of commercial production at
  constancia and higher throughput levels at lalor

  achieved cost reduction initiatives in 2016 with consolidated cash cost of 093 per pound copper and
  consolidated allin sustaining cash costs of 152 per pound copper lower than 2015 levels by 19 and 30
  respectively

  safety performance broadly consistent with 2015

manitoba
  andré lauzon hired as new head of the manitoba business unit

  ore processed at the stall concentrator was 17 higher than in 2015 as a result of higher production at lalor

  11 reduction in unit operating costs over 2015

  initiated study into potential for sustaining operations at the flin flon zinc plant

peru
  in its first full year of commercial operation constancia mined over 265 million tonnes of ore and produced
  527296 tonnes of copper concentrate

  full year production of copper gold and silver was 26 39 and 39 higher than 2015 respectively all above
  constancia guidance ranges in 2016

  driven by ongoing cost optimization efforts and improved maintenance timing cash cost per pound of copper
  produced net of byproduct credits for 2016 was 109 a decrease of 6 over the previous year

financials
price cyclicality is part of the mining cycle one that hudbay has been managing successfully for over nine decades in
2016 we were able to draw on that history to meet or exceed all of our production targets while our actual
sustaining capital spending was 20 lower than our 2016 guidance our revenue for the year was 11287 million
2426 million higher than in 2015 faced with both a challenging price environment and lower copper sales
volumes we were able to hold our cash cost per pound of copper produced net of byproduct credits steady at
146 per pound

as a member of the mining association of canada mac hudbay participates in the towards sustainable
mining tsm initiative which requires mining companies to annually assess their facilities performance
across six important areas

  tailings management

  aboriginal and community outreach

  safety and health

  biodiversity conservation

  crisis management

  energy use and greenhouse gas emissions management

the results are freely available to the public and externally verified every three years

every year two or three companies that have recently undergone external verification are asked to
participate in a postverification review pvr led by a multistakeholder community of interest coi
advisory panel the pvr helps the panel analyze activities that contribute to tsm results and promote
continuous improvement in the environmental and social practices of the mining industry we were pleased
to participate in a pvr in 2016 as a way of improving our own performance and helping raise industry
standards

as part of the pvr we submitted background information about hudbays sustainability and tsm
performance presented to the coi advisory panel via webinar and then participated in a facetoface
dialogue in ottawa the panels summary of findings are published on the mac website

precautionary approach
through the life of a mine hudbay operates under the precautionary principle the duty to prevent harm when it is
within our power to do so working with a balance of probabilities if a scientific conclusion is not yet available we
use baseline environmental and social impact studies to evaluate how to avoid mitigate or control potentially
significant impacts implement appropriate monitoring and management systems and address the need for mine
closure in all cases provision is made for public consultation and input

csr approach
human rights and security
governments have the primary responsibility for protecting human rights and business has the duty to respect
these rights together with our code of business conduct and ethics hudbays human rights policy spells out our
commitment to human rights and draws on internationally accepted standards for business and labour practices
community participation and security measures

in the workplace all individuals are to be treated with respect and dignity we do not tolerate discrimination on the
basis of race colour religion gender national origin age sexual orientation or disability or any other category
protected by applicable laws

individuals are encouraged to report any real or perceived human rights concerns by contacting the hudbay board of
directors directly through our corporate website through the thirdparty ethics hotline or through site grievance
mechanisms

security practices
in keeping with our human rights policy we follow the voluntary principles on security and human rights an
operating framework that ensures security practices include respect for human rights our approach is rooted in the
belief that effective security is built through trustbased relationships with neighbouring communities and principle
based professional conduct by our employees and security contractors

as required based on risk assessments we train security personnel on the united nations un code of conduct for
law enforcement officials and the un basic principles on the use of force and firearms by law enforcement
officials there is an extensive ongoing training program in peru security supervisors and contracted security staff
there are unarmed except for governmentmandated armed security guards at the explosive storage area

in peru we regularly audit security policies and practices and conduct gap analyses against the voluntary principles
following a competitive bid process we renewed our contract with the security firm at constancia in 2016 which
resulted in all equipment vehicles radios personal kits and uniforms being upgraded and a much lower turnover
rate among security personnel we also upgraded the communication system in the operations centre which
proved to be helpful during protest situations

security personnel work closely with constancias community relations team to maintain open lines of
communication with communities and mitigate potential issues their efforts helped resolve three community
incidents safely and peacefully during the year in each case the peruvian national police intervened because
national laws were being violated constancia security supervisors followed established procedures for working with
the police which included briefings on our commitments to uphold the voluntary principles the un code of
conduct for law enforcement officials and the un basic principles on the use of force and firearms by law
enforcement officials

because periodic social unrest affected certain mining projects in southern peru in 2016 the constancia security
superintendent met on five occasions with security managers from neighbouring mines the security group known
as semsur discusses best practices experiences and emerging issues hudbay has also used these meetings to
explain our commitment to and share our experience with the voluntary principles on security and human rights

in arizona we hired a security manager who has developed security procedures for our facilities and plans for
eventual construction and operations the new security manager also worked with local law enforcement and
emergency response agencies to create the rosemont safety and security work group the group meets to discuss
latest project developments safety or security incidents or plans at the property and how to coordinate efforts
should an emergency arise

csr approach
stakeholder engagement
stakeholder engagement is essential for building trust strengthening relationships reducing social risk and
improving opportunities to create value for the company and our stakeholders

hudbays corporate stakeholder engagement and community response standards and guidance documents provide
clear direction on our expectations each business unit is expected to use engagement practices that reflect local
context but remain consistent with hudbays objectives

in 2016 our board adopted a shareholder engagement policy to encourage open and sustained dialogue with
shareholders the policy outlines ways to contact hudbays board and senior management and lists relevant topics
to discuss with each group

we use our integrated software management system to log stakeholder engagement activities we plan to expand
this application in the coming year and use it for documenting stakeholder commitments and associated action
plans and tracking donation requests and decisions

boundaries
the materiality review was conducted on the initial boundary assumption of activities and facilities within hudbays
management control as described in the our company section of this report participants in the review process
were then asked for cases in which boundary limits should be adjusted for specific aspects the exceptions that were
agreed to be appropriate based on stakeholder expectations and business risk are as follows

  safety statistics are tracked and reported for all contractor activities that are under hudbay contracts and
  supervision

  environmental incidents related to transportation between hudbay locations and local supplier activities are
  generally tracked and reviewed by hudbay but are not included in performance reporting in this report

  grievances are accepted and investigated with respect to local contractors and security activities related to
  hudbay and are included in grievance numbers and characterization in this report and

  scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated and reported

csr approach
responsible supply chain
mining is the first stage of a long supply chain that converts mineral resources into products that meet the needs of
everyday life

we focus our supply chain responsibility efforts on activities where we can have the greatest influence  our own
operations contractors working at our sites local suppliers and hudbay products up to the point at which they are
shipped in manitoba the plant gate and in peru the port loading facility

we are committed to conducting our own business honestly and ethically in compliance with the law and in keeping
with our code of business conduct and ethics we expect our suppliers and service providers to do the same
supplier standards include the following

   all contractors working at our sites are expected to meet the companys environmental health and safety and
   human rights standards

   our statement on anticorruption updated in 2016 includes antibribery and anticorruption provisions for
   suppliers

   our corporate local procurement and employment standard is aimed at supporting and utilizing local workforce
   skills and business capacity to provide goods and services

supply chain performance
the direct supply chain for our copper concentrate and zinc metal products originates in hudbays own mines in
northern manitoba and peru

the indirect supply chain for energy goods and services used in transforming ore and concentrate into products
includes thousands of suppliers this supply chain includes operating supplies maintenance supplies energy and
fuels as well as capital goods

   in peru our top 50 suppliers accounted for 88 of our spending and 95 of our spending was with suppliers
   based in peru

   in manitoba our supplier base relates to production operations and capital projects our top 50 suppliers
   represented 50 of our spending in 2016 and 95 of spending was with suppliers in canada these suppliers
   provided goods and services such as engineering services electricity spare parts for equipment underground

copper is an essential component in electronics and electrical transmission applications for copper use are
increasingly being identified in health care facilities public transport and airports because of its powerful ability to
kill bacteria zinc is vital to the endurance of metals in manufacturing

our two main products copper concentrate and zinc metal come from our own mines in canada and peru

   40 of hudbays copper concentrate was sold to smelters in the americas and europe and 60 to smelters in
   asia from there several stages of smelting and refining the copper content ultimately result in 9999 pure
   copper which provides the building block for many of lifes essentials

   we ship cast zinc metal produced at our flin flon zinc plant by rail and truck to industrial customers primarily
   galvanizers who use it to protect steel from corrosion throughout north america

copper and zinc products are accompanied by material safety data sheets that provide details on product
composition toxicology handling storage and exposure issues we also meet our product stewardship
commitments by collaborating with governments and industry associations such as the international zinc association
and the european copper institute to help guide our compliance with international requirements such as those
provided by the international maritime organization imo

the imo has established hazard classification criteria for bulk cargoes and the international convention for the
prevention of pollution from ships marpol has imposed restrictions on the disposal of bulk cargo residues which
have been classified as harmful to the marine environment hme under the amended annex v of the marpol
convention hudbay engaged the european copper institute eci to determine the marpol classification for
constancias copper concentrates from this study and others all hudbay copper concentrates have been
determined to not be hme

                                                 safety accountability starts at the
                                                 top




recognizing the importance of leadership in creating a positive safety culture we introduced a company
wide visible felt leadership vfl program for all levels of management including the ceo vfl guides
leaders to conduct regular safetyfocused workplace visits and to engage constructively with employees at
all levels of operations its a way of demonstrating to employees the importance we place on their safety
and wellbeing and to engage positively around safety issues

as part of the corporate vfl procedure senior leaders complete a form each time they conduct a workplace
visit they document who they talked with and all safe acts and atrisk behaviours or conditions they
observed they also establish responsibilities and timelines for followup on safety concerns each business
unit has implemented its own vfl procedure tailored to its workplace and used by its business unit leaders

employee conversations are an essential part of the program says ian cooper manager health and safety
they provide an opportunity for employees and leaders to have meaningful oneonone or small group
discussions about safety performance and concerns in their workplace which leads to a greater sense of
personal accountability for safe work practices and ultimately to better results

                                                  building leaders from within




over the next three years well be rolling out a global leadership initiative aimed at building sustainable
leadership bench strength throughout hudbay an important part of it will be training courses offered at
introductory intermediate and advanced levels introductory level courses will be held locally while
intermediate courses will bring people from different business units together at rotating locations and
advanced courses will be customized to individual needs

as a starting point we created a leadership model with business input that articulates what we consider to
be hudbays core leadership competencies the competencies fall into three main categories growing
people growing the company and growing oneself

according to amanda abballe human resources manager growing people is important because
experienced and talented people are the basis for our companys success and we are responsible for
developing a skilled workforce growing hudbay is important for being an adaptable and focused
organization positioned to succeed in an everchanging environment growing oneself builds confidence in
ones abilities and a desire to continuously improve which are building blocks for personal success

course content will be finalized in 2017 and we expect to begin delivering the program to the first cohort
before yearend

our people
our approach
our business depends on qualified employees who share our values and are committed to achieving our goals we
emphasize communication health and safety training and development and respect for one another as means of
attracting engaging and retaining talented people and fostering healthy labour relations

health and safety
we seek a culture of zero harm and make fatality prevention our first priority it is essential that employees and
contractors at our sites have the knowledge skills and equipment needed to perform their jobs safely  and the
support of management and coworkers to approach each task the right way

consistent with hudbays management systems approach operations are required to have management systems
certified to the ohsas 18001 health and safety management standard within two years of startup we also commit
to following the mining association of canadas towards sustainable mining tsm health and safety protocol

conformance with these standards requires regular monitoring selfassessments and thirdparty audits were
putting increased attention on assessing our management systems to ensure theyre efficient and effective in
helping us achieve the health safety community and environmental performance we want and maintain the
externally recognized certifications

in addition to introducing the visible felt leadership program in 2016 we focused on learning from severe and high
potential close call safety incidents by ensuring uniform application of incident criteria investigation processes and
corrective action our procedure for highpotential incidents includes requirements that they be reviewed by senior
management and investigated using the incident cause analysis method icam or an equivalent process more than
30 people in manitoba have been trained in icam and training has begun in peru to encourage reporting and
learning from highpotential incidents we focus on the speed of investigation and corrective action rather than the
number of incidents

in 2016 we began implementing critical risk and critical control crcc management as part of our fatality
prevention focus both our manitoba and peru operations are putting in place processes to prioritize the
identification of key risks that could lead to fatalities and key controls to manage those risks

at operating sites we maintain health monitoring programs that include hearing and lung function testing and
biological monitoring for employees who may be exposed to hazardous metals in the workplace

our integrated management software system supports the process of recording investigating and tracking all types
of health and safety incidents and nonconformances across the company

employee relations
we promote a onehudbay culture across all sites characterized by open communications high engagement levels
and healthy employeemanagement relations

to do so we offer safe and meaningful work and competitive pay and benefits wherever we operate employees are
actively involved in projects aimed at driving operational efficiencies and cost savings wellness programs are run by
employee committees which organize lunch and learns competitions and targeted campaigns for common topics
like managing stress and healthy eating information sharing and knowledge transfer across our operations is
encouraged through short and longterm international assignments a vibrant intranet and online tools and
frequent senior management visits and communications

we respect the rights of workers to join unions and engage in collective bargaining without interference or fear of
retaliation and we work to build productive relationships with these unions in order to collaborate on key matters
approximately 677 of our workforce 1121 employees is represented by a union

training and development
training programs are offered at every career stage including career readiness and tutoring recent graduate
programs and apprenticeship programs in 2016 we launched a global leadership initiative aimed at building a
sustainable leadership pipeline from within




hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                                                                      41

our people
manitoba
the majority of our employees work in our manitoba business unit we employed 1036 people at the flin flon and
reed operations and 306 at snow lake at yearend 2016 there was a notable shift during the year as almost an
equal number of people at flin flon retired as were hired at lalor with the 777 mine at flin flon nearing closure
many of the vacated positions were not backfilled

our workforce in manitoba is more diverse and multifaceted than might be expected approximately 13 self
identify as aboriginal since many of our aboriginal hires have limited experience in the workforce our aboriginal
liaison officer works with new hires to support their integration into the workplace at lalor women in senior roles
include the chief geologist chief mine engineer and stall mill superintendent women in production roles operate
everything from underground mine equipment to the hoists that transport people equipment and ore between
working areas as much as a kilometre below the ground and the surface

there were three dominant themes in the manitoba business unit in 2016 safety cost reduction and workforce
transition

strengthening our safety culture
safety performance in 2016 was similar to the previous year in terms of lost time accident frequency and severity
but there were a number of highpotential incidents safety incidents that had the potential to be very serious and
this was a matter of concern at one point we brought all mining crews to the surface for workshops reinforcing
safety concepts around vehicle interactions incident cause analysis method icam investigations were conducted
after each incident to identify root causes and corrective actions related to communications underground lighting
equipment and training were implemented

through the investigations and subsequent management meetings it became clear that while we may have had
good safety policies and procedures in place we needed to achieve more consistent application as a result we
worked to strengthen our safety culture and ensure that people follow the rules and take accountability for their
actions the visible felt leadership program was introduced as part of this effort

cost control and operational efficiency
our manitoba operations stepped up their cost control and operational efficiency efforts in response to low metal
prices through their great work we met our cost reduction goals and production targets

a prime example of an improvement initiative was the redesign of ground support at the lalor mine ground control
is critical for the safety of personnel and carries significant operating costs analysis of several ground control
incidents that occurred early in the year fortunately with no injuries led to a redesign of ground support methods
that both increased safety and reduced overall costs in 2017 well continue to engage with employees and work to
improve productivity efficiency and safety

workforce in transition
with the 777 and reed mines nearing the end of their operating lives several teams are assessing future options for
the flin flon metallurgical complex in the hopes of finding an opportunity to sustain some of those operations and
jobs in a way that also provides an appropriate return to our shareholders

at the same time we need to plan for the closure of these mines and continued expansion of the lalor operations in
2016 we began drafting a plan outlining our future workforce needs and how we can transition employees from flin
flon to snow lake we also began meeting with union leaders to engage them in this work

we continue to support our apprenticeship program which covers a wide range of trades including electrician
boilermakerwelder mechanic machinist pipefitter and carpenter if selected for the program candidates follow a
prescribed program that includes working with a journeyman and attending school at the companys expense four
people graduated in 2016 and 35 remain enrolled



                                              our flin flon team placed second overall in
                                              the 2016 manitoba provincial mine rescue
                                              competition and the snow lake team won
                                              the firefighting competition mine rescue
                                              competitions test a variety of skills including
                                              emergency response plans and
                                              competencies of response personnel

our people
peru
at the start of constancia operations we drew on the expertise of stracon gym to mine on a contract basis since
then weve accumulated sufficient experience to bring mine operation inhouse and transfer employees from
stracon gym to hudbay transferred individuals are put on the companys pay and benefits system and participate in
our orientation process

at yearend we directly employed 593 people in peru in either fulltime or contract positions of this total seven
positions are held by expatriate staff

healthy and engaging workplace
we believe in maintaining a positive healthy and engaging work environment with many workers staying onsite at
companyprovided accommodations for eight to 14 days at a time we offer a variety of health and wellness services
including a medical centre massage therapy chiropractic services and sports programs in 2016 we initiated town
hall and small group meetings for business unit leaders to share operating results and challenges we also started
the hr now newsletter to keep people informed of site activities and build social cohesion

as is typical with large peruvian mining operations following startup some of the employees at constancia have
formed a labour union an initial collective agreement was signed with the union in 2017

safety record
our 2016 lost time accident frequency of 01 was consistent with 2015 performance notably we achieved an 83
reduction in accident severity

as part of the visible felt leadership program business unit leaders made a point of going out into the operations
and engaging with employees on safety we also began a process of identifying the top five risks in each area of
operations and ensuring that appropriate controls are in place and broadly understood and followed

weve put in place hearing respiratory protection and biological monitoring programs employees who are
potentially exposed to occupational health hazards as a function of their regular duties are tested and trained on
control measures and procedures such as the proper use and care of personal protective equipment

in 2016 we continued our safety program with the trucking contractors whose drivers haul concentrate along the
470kilometre route from constancia to the port at matarani the program includes driver training and competency
testing as well as education on fatigue management and aggressive driving there are control points en route to
check driver compliance and allow drivers to rest if tired in addition trucks are linked to a gps monitoring system
that tracks location and driving speed

continuous learning
across the business unit each person received an average of 25 hours of training training included an effective
leadership practice program attended by more than 50 people which was designed to help leaders put our
corporate values into action in their everyday work

we also completed a trainee program that saw 16 recently graduated students from peruvian universities work in
the process plant for a oneyear period five of the participants were hired to fulltime roles at the end of the year

our people
arizona
our arizona human resources hr team spent the year putting the final touches on people management systems
and policies that will be needed once rosemont is approved for construction this included finalizing a drug and
alcohol policy and implementing the onehudbay online goal setting module to ensure that all employees have
meaningful performance goals in place which then become the basis of their annual performance evaluations

we promoted employee engagement through a variety of health and wellness educational social and community
initiatives the employee wellness committee organized walks and hikes including a threemile rosemont ranch hike
in the spring and lunch and learns on health topics in 2016 employees were invited on a tour of a neighbouring
mine to get a better feel for what its like to work at an operating mine

                                                benchmarking hudbays efforts in
                                                aboriginal inclusion




hudbay achieved a bronze level standing in the progressive aboriginal relations par program of the
canadian council for aboriginal business ccab in 2016 the par program supports improvement in
corporate performance in aboriginal relations in canada through benchmarking against a broad set of
criteria in the areas of employment business development community investment community
engagement and company strategy the certification process confirms performance through an extensive
questionnaire that is assessed by an independent thirdparty verifier who reviews the responses and meets
with aboriginal stakeholders and company personnel to validate the responses final determination at the
bronze silver or gold level is by a jury comprised of aboriginal business people

in each of the past three years hudbay completed the par questionnaire for our canadian operations and
each year the verifiers report provided guidance to improve our program in 2016 the report was then
reviewed by a jury of aboriginal business leaders who determined that hudbay met the requirements for
bronze level in the par program

thirtyone of the 123 ccab member companies are par certified and six of these companies are at the
bronze level for hudbay achieving bronze level represents important progress in our efforts to include
aboriginal communities in our business its important to us as a company that we deliver on this
commitment with aboriginal communities this achievement shows that were on the right track said pam
marsden aboriginal liaison officer manitoba business unit

as part of our developmentfocused relationship with the regional government hudbay peru sponsored the
construction of a modern dairy plant in the chumbivilcas region the cullahuata dairy currently processes
4000 litres of milk per day and expects to increase production to 12000 litres in the near future it also
produces several varieties of cheese yogurt and butter

the longterm goal is to establish a dairy corridor in the region in 2016 harmony organic dairy in
kincardine ontario stepped up to help establishing a mentoring relationship with the cullahuata dairy
harmony organic came to know the dairy through one of the global indigenous development trust trips
that hudbay had sponsored

harmony organics ceo visited the cullahuata dairy and is helping it become certified as organic as part of
that effort two farmers from chumbivilcas were invited to kincardine to work at harmony for a term and
learn by doing two more will go in 2017 the knowledge they bring back  about farming animal
management and dairy operation  will be important in establishing the regions first certified organic dairy

in august 2016 at the third annual community relations international conference in peru hudbay was
honoured to receive a community relations award for its work in the construction and management of the
cullahuata dairy plant

social impact
our approach
responsible companies strive to make a positive difference in society hudbay seeks to maximize the benefits we
create minimize any adverse impacts and build longterm mutually beneficial relationships

economic contributions
our primary contributions to the regions where we operate are economic through jobs training and the purchase
of goods and services from local businesses we pay municipal taxes and grants and in some cases provide funding
to communities under land use agreements or other cooperation agreements importantly we also contribute
funding and expertise to support the development of sustainable communities and livelihoods

hudbay is a supporting company of the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti in its efforts to establish a
global standard for transparency regarding host country governance of natural resources and full disclosure of
government revenues from its extractive sector our peruvian subsidiary hudbay peru sac as a member of the
peruvian mining society is supporting the eiti process in peru

in canada the extractive sector transparency measures act estma was proclaimed into force on june 1 2015 and
requires businesses involved in the resource exploration and extractive sector to file reports on certain types of
payments to foreign governments hudbay will be filing its first estma report in may 2017 for the 2016 fiscal year

community relations
through engagement we strive to understand and address community members concerns and priorities and
establish relationships based on mutual respect and trust

as defined in our stakeholder engagement standard each business unit conducts its own stakeholder analysis and
implements a stakeholder engagement plan tailored to local needs in addition to sharing information about our
business sites actively seek out and respond to community member feedback and work together with communities
on joint committees and projects to solve issues and promote social economic and environmental sustainability
stakeholder priorities and concerns in 2016 are listed in the stakeholder engagement section of this report

our companywide community response standard also known as a grievance process ensures that complaints at
each site are documented investigated and addressed

in addition to operational and environmental considerations mine closure planning takes into account social impacts
and the prosperity and resiliency of communities after operations cease these activities underline the importance of
building community capacity and helping communities avoid dependency on operations throughout the life of the
mine

indigenous engagement
we seek to build mutual understanding and positive relationships with indigenous peoples through active
engagement and collaboration on exploration environment skills development employment and business
opportunities




hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                                                                          49

we demonstrate our respect and support for social and cultural practices by funding and participating in indigenous
community activities training our employees in cultural awareness and implementing cultural resource preservation
plans in manitoba we have a fulltime aboriginal liaison officer alo who is a permanent bridge between
manitobas and saskatchewans first nations communities and hudbay the alo works within the company to
promote understanding of first nation protocols visàvis proposed projects and share information on opportunities
for these communities at hudbay

local hiring and procurement
we prioritize local hiring skills development and sourcing local procurement and employment in particular are
often identified as high priorities for stakeholders

our corporate local procurement and employment lpe standard requires each site to

   identify opportunities for supporting and utilizing local workforce skills

   identify opportunities for local business to provide goods and services

   include lpe provisions when negotiating community agreements

   integrate lpe into ongoing business processes

our approach is guided by five principles mutual benefit fairness competitiveness and transparency targeted
capacity development informed and integrated decisionmaking and collaboration with community representatives
and supporting organizations

local skills development is aimed not just at developing a talent pool for our own operations but also at building
transferrable skills for employment at places other than the mine it includes supporting existing livelihoods like
ranching or farming as well as providing scholarships and funding for technical training at universities and colleges

community development
in most cases our mines are catalysts for development in nearby communities we support community development
efforts focused on

   helping communities build capacity to ensure sustained prosperity

   supporting community efforts to improve the quality of the natural environment

   contributing to social cohesion and community spirit

when we enter a region we engage with communities to understand their social and economic needs and priorities
from there we seek to create employment and business opportunities and programs in some cases our community
development commitments are spelled out in formal agreements with the communities frequently we help
communities through the process of requesting government funding for their projects

our community giving and investment standard outlines the strategic approach that hudbay sites are expected to
follow for voluntary support contributions and investments in local communities it emphasizes community
involvement mutual benefit partnerships sustainability and capacity development

resettlement and land use
in the development of a project resettlement is sometimes necessary when it is as was the case for the
development of the constancia mine we follow negotiation processes that adhere to international standards for
fairness and transparency including the ifc performance standards and commit to providing equal or better

in situations where mining extends to land used for livelihoods households or communities we explore alternatives
to minimize disturbances and implement measures to protect human rights and cultural heritage

social impact
manitoba
the lalor mine resources and exploration potential provide a foundation for growth in the town of snow lake and
continued operations in manitoba for a currently estimated 105 years however a mine cannot last forever  this is
inherent in the nature of mining and we recognize the impact of closure on local employees and communities

planning for closure
with production at the 777 and reed mines ending in the next few years were assessing future options for the flin
flon metallurgical complex in the hope of identifying operations that can continue to contribute an acceptable
return to shareholders

were also participating in the efforts of the mayors and municipal administrators of flin flon creighton and denare
beach who have joined forces to support a smooth social and economic transition and encourage economic
diversification of the region in 2016 hudbay engaged a community planning consultant who held two planning
workshops with community leaders on this topic we participated in the workshops at the request of the
communities

building relations in snow lake
in snow lake we initiated quarterly meetings with the mayor and town council and participated in two community
meetings during the year two key topics of discussion were the accommodation camp we maintain at the site and
the annual grantinlieu gil payment made to the town of snow lake

with the continued expansion of the lalor mine and the need to recruit skilled workers from across the region we
have had to keep the camp open longer than anticipated many employees are choosing to commute to work and
stay at the camp during their shifts rather than move their families we understand the concerns of the snow lake
community and expect to work through the issue with them over time in a way that suits our employees and the
community

while we pay municipal taxes for facilities situated within the town of snow lake our mining operations are located
outside the town proper and are covered by an annual negotiated grantinlieu payment to the town despite
extended negotiations we were unable to resolve the amount of the 2016 gil by yearend in order to maintain our
longstanding commitment we made a payment just before yearend which represented a 53 increase over the
payments made in the two previous years and committed to continuing negotiations in 2017

progressive aboriginal relations
the aboriginal communities near our operations include opaskwayak cree nation mosakahiken cree nation and
mathias colomb cree nation in manitoba and three communities in saskatchewan that are part of the peter
ballantyne cree nation through meetings school presentations mine tours open houses and collaborating on joint
initiatives usually related to employment we work to maintain constructive relationships

our aboriginal liaison officer alo spearheads our efforts in 2016 this work culminated in our achieving the
canadian council of aboriginal business bronze level standing in the progressive aboriginal relations program

the alo assists aboriginal job candidates throughout the recruiting interviewing and onboarding process
recognizing the challenges they may encounter as they enter an industrial work environment for the first time and
the need for hudbay to be flexible and accommodating the mentoring process includes personal financial and
policy advisement from the alo and continues for as long as needed

in response to the truth and reconciliation commission of canada recommendations particularly recommendation
92 which is a call to action to businesses we hosted a presentation on the intergenerational effects of residential
schools together with the flin flon aboriginal friendship centre the opaskwayak cree nation and the flin flon
chamber of commerce elders community members and hudbay employees were on hand to hear a moving
personal account by a secondgeneration residential school survivor

we also partnered with the flin flon aboriginal friendship centre to create a unified understanding of the mino
pimatisiwin sweat lodge ceremony on the eve of the fall equinox the intention of the ceremony was to make
peace with past activity and build on respectful relationships with teachings from the past that are conducted in
contemporary time several individuals gathered to pray sing and share a feast the elder shared teachings on
meanings behind the ceremony before during and after the event we plan to hold a similar event in the spring of
2017

other activities included cultural awareness workshops for hudbay employees and separately for committee
members from the saskatchewan government and the peter ballantyne cree nation communities youth outreach
related to careers in mining and the start of quarterly economic development meetings to inform first nations
communities of business opportunities at hudbay

at the corporate level hudbay made a third annual donation of 25000 to the indspire building bright futures
bursaries scholarships and awards program in 2016 our contribution supported 15 aboriginal students from
manitoba enrolled in postsecondary education programs in canada in 2016

supporting our neighbours
hudbay donated approximately c160000 to community initiatives and university research benefiting the flin
flonsnow lake area primarily in the areas of health education environment culture and sports major
contributions 10000 or more included

   flin flon community adult learning centre sponsorship

   flin flon bombers junior hockey team

   green project  a multiyear project aimed at accelerating restoration of forest land around flin flon and
   creighton

   nw regional caribou research and management committee

in addition our employees contributed more than 200 hours to community projects such as helping out at the flin
flon school division science fair and with operation red nose a safe ride home service for area residents during the
holiday season

community hotline
we invite community members to report any concerns or complaints through our concernalert email and phone
line there were four complaints registered in 2016 relating to one contractors safety another contractors
environmental performance lake safety and a visual annoyance

social impact
peru
our growing track record of addressing concerns and tangibly improving the lives of local stakeholders is enabling us
to build goodwill in communities in peru while we cannot fulfill every stakeholder interest we are known for our
strong commitment to transparency and communication

efforts are spearheaded by our government and community relations teams the community relations team has
offices open to the public in both communities in our direct area of influence and engages with the public and
authorities along the concentrate transportation route their work was key to helping us peacefully resolve three
potentially serious community incidents in 2016

our closest neighbours
the two communities closest to the constancia operations are uchucarco and chilloroya we have life of mine land
use agreements with both communities letting us use portions of their communityowned land

as part of the agreements we made specific commitments to local employment and use of local suppliers and to
investments in health education and social development multisectorial committees for development cmds
comprising hudbay and community representatives approve and oversee the projects being carried out using the
proceeds of the agreements the funds were used in 2016 to purchase ambulances for the health centres in each
community and to fund a telemedicine project that will improve access to quality health care through
telecommunications technology

supporting community development
beyond our immediate neighbours we support community development throughout the region in a variety of ways

weve signed cooperation agreements with nine communities and districts in our indirect area of influence
committing to work together on social development projects within a specified budget provided by hudbay in
fulfilling these agreements we also engage with various levels of government and implement some projects as
publicprivate partnerships weve completed four projects under the peruvian works for taxes program which
allows a company to pay up to half of its income tax through contributions to public infrastructure projects

in 2016 we reached an agreement with the district of livitaca that will bring major improvements to water and
sanitation services and signed a cooperation agreement with the district of velille just before the end of the year

under a cooperation agreement with the district of chamaca hudbay funded a forestation program for the
10 communities the program included 12 tree nurseries warehouses in each community for storing equipment
technical training and promotional events during the year hudbay peru and the district of chamaca also
inaugurated the first liquid nitrogen plant in the province of chumbivilcas which we funded as part of an agrarian
development project the facility is used for breeding cattle using practices that promote genetic improvements
that will in turn enhance milk and meat production

weve signed cooperation agreements with three communities on the transportation route from constancia to the
port at matarani under these agreements hudbay commits to exploring how we can help with development
projects this can be as simple as providing seeds and equipment for farming community crops or as extensive as
offering the services of our technical assistance office to act as an advocate for the communities in applying for
public and private funding of projects

building community capacity
constancia employed 644 local people employees and contractors in 2016 mostly from the communities of
uchucarco and chilloroya about 90 people work in advanced jobs operating heavy equipment or providing technical
assistance in the processing plant after having completed technical training funded by hudbay the remaining
employees work as general labourers in operations and logistics and in hospitality jobs at the camp whatever the
role these are new secure wellpaying jobs that otherwise would not exist in the area

we have two ongoing technical training programs for community members of uchucarco and chilloroya a joint
venture with stracon gym provides four months of basic operator training thirtyfive people completed the
program in 2016 and worked for stracon gym for several months thereafter

a program with servosa our main transportation provider offers six weeks of professional driver training five
people completed the course in 2016 and joined servosas workforce at the request of the communities we also
conducted reinforcement training for people who had not passed the first time

in addition the constancia operations team provides ad hoc training to community members when positions
become available in total 20 people from uchucarco and chilloroya participated in this type of training in 2016

hudbay also works with the global indigenous development trust to promote community capacity building weve
sponsored several trips that bring people from communities near constancia to canadian towns particularly mining
communities they see how mining and sustainable development can coexist and thrive and hear directly from
canadian community municipal and business leaders about their experiences

local companies provide valuable services
there were 75 local community companies registered in our database in 2016 our purchases from them totaled
approximately 87 million this is a significant decrease from the 259 million spent the previous year mainly due
to the fact that fewer services are required during the operation phase than the construction phase

most local companies are focused on trucking or hospitality we collaborated with the cmd in uchucarco in 2015 to
buy trucks they could rent to local contractors to transport constancia concentrate to the port of matarani this has
worked well and they are providing a valuable service to us were in discussions with the community of chilloroya
about hospitality services they can provide to both our accommodation camp and those of nearby mines

5000yearold reminders of the past
we opened an exhibit this past year at the fortunia accommodation camp which displays the archaeological findings
made during the exploration and construction of constancia some of the artifacts date back nearly 5000 years
including spearheads that were used for hunting and gathering food

community complaints and concerns
there were 28 complaints or concerns registered through the constancia grievance mechanism in 2016 of the total
82 related to local employment and were typically investigated and resolved through coordination with the
relevant functions within hudbay

social impact
arizona
the rosemont project site is located 48 kilometres 30 miles southeast of tucson arizonas second largest city
including the surrounding areas the diverse population totals close to one million people there are numerous local
stakeholder groups with varying areas of interest a number have followed the rosemont project closely for many
years most eagerly await rosemonts construction given its potential to generate jobs and boost the local economy
a smaller number are vocal opponents of the project often on an environmental basis rosemont is committed to
understanding the interests of all stakeholder groups and constructively engaging with them to ensure that theyre
informed of our plans and that we understand their concerns

permitting and stakeholder consultation
the rosemont project has been going through the permit approval process for more than nine years by yearend
2016 the process had included 17 government agencies more than 450 studies and more than 43000 public
comments to the agencies through hearings letters emails and phone calls

stakeholder concerns have related primarily to environmental impacts but also to worries about noise traffic
cultural heritage and recreational use impacts our plan to design build and operate a unique mine incorporates
some of the most advanced thinking in mining at rosemont we will implement more than 60 million in mitigation
measures to balance the presence of the mine with the natural elements around it these are detailed in the
rosemont environmental impact statement prepared by the united states department of agriculture forest service
and the rosemont biological opinion from the us fish and wildlife service there are 114 individual mitigation and
monitoring requirements within the forest service requirements alone which add up to hundreds of millions of
dollars in further expenditures for mitigation and monitoring obligations over the life of the mine these include

  a well owners protection program

  monitoring a jaguar for the life of the project plus five years

  conservation activities for aquatic and bird species

  dark skies monitoring for the life of the project

  relocation of 106 miles of the arizona trail in collaboration with the arizona trail association

  annual community donations of 500000 per year during operations

  an endowment fund to support cultural recreational education and conservation community goals after
  operation

see the arizona environment page of this report to learn more about the mitigation measures planned for
rosemont

building meaningful relationships
weve put in place a community relations cr plan with a stated mission of building constructive relationships with
stakeholders based on integrity and mutual respect by communicating timely accurate and consistent messages
the plan includes tools and systems developed to proactively identify assess and mitigate risks associated with
planned activities and new developments related to rosemont that may affect community relations




hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                                                                      56

as permitting advanced we refined our plans in 2016 to address how we intend to keep stakeholders informed once
construction begins we want to make sure that stakeholders know well in advance what to expect at each stage we
also conducted an indepth stakeholder mapping exercise with outside expertise to help us identify our key
stakeholders and better understand their interests and level of influence

separately we had an audit performed of our community giving process to identify opportunities to improve
transparency and ensure that all donations are in accordance with the business units community giving priorities as
a result we now have a community giving review committee that meets monthly and reviews all requests for
funding against our priorities and budget decisions are documented and distributed among business unit leaders
before final approval

work continues on cap water pipeline
a significant part of our rosemont community investment is the construction of a pipeline to carry central arizona
project cap water to the green valley area its part of a commitment made to the community that allows the
community water company of green valley to make use of its cap allocation and offset groundwater drawdown
within its service area

in 2016 approximately 2000 feet of 54inch pipeline was installed under the interstate highway i19 near the
terminus station at a cost of just over 1 million this section of pipe is the second segment of the nearly eightmile
long pipeline that will be installed at an estimated overall cost of 25 million

helping hand in the community
were committed to providing financial support to local nonprofit organizations that provide services and programs
in five prioritized areas education in particular science technology engineering environment agriculture and
mathematics initiatives social services military and veterans support job training and infrastructure projects

our school grants program awards between 500 and 5000 to local public schools grants totaling 10000 were
given in 2016 including a 1500 grant to flowing wells school district to expand its first tech challenge program
where students work in teams to build robots and then face off in competitions against other schools

as part of the 2016 united way campaign employees were given a day off to volunteer at one of two community
projects they either did landscaping and moved furniture at a womens shelter or washed windows and blinds at an
assisted living building for seniors

                                                  awarded for reclamation




hudbay peru received an snmpe national society of mining petroleum and energy sustainable
development award in the environmental management category for its progressive reclamation practices

in keeping with environmental best practices we try to return land to its original state as soon as its no
longer required as part of production at constancia we implemented a program that paid community
members for collecting native grass seed for reclamation purposes and helping plant the seeds and erect
erosion control structures

the response to the program by the local communities of chilloroya uchucarco casa blanca collana alta
and huaylla huaylla was overwhelmingly positive with 22 tonnes of native seeds collected and over 26
hectares of land revegetated in less than a year

six community members work with us on an ongoing basis managing our tree nursery and doing
reclamation work were planning to conduct a largerscale forestation program in 2017 and will hire
additional workers for that

                                                   maintaining dark skies




maintaining dark skies is important to scientific astronomy in arizona but must be aligned with the need to
meet employee safety requirements of the mine safety and health administration msha to achieve both
goals the rosemont project will implement a groundbreaking technologically advanced lighting system

we updated our lighting plan in 2016 in consultation with an international dark sky association board
member features include the use of filtered led fixtures colour rendering to avoid bluespectrum lights
which are among the most harmful to dark skies and shieldingbeam control on nonfixed lights to reduce
direct uplight all of these measures will minimize the effects artificial lighting can have on the night sky in
addition we plan to implement a variety of dust control measures that will aid in reducing potential light
dispersion

the impact of these new measures will be significant  reducing output from 21815355 lumens in the
original engineering plans to 6529184 lumens

our other commitments include annual funding to the smithsonian institution at the whipple observatory
to measure light and light effects and implement additional groundbased monitoring sites during
operations light emissions will continue to be monitored by stem labs a nonprofit organization dedicated
to understanding the effects of maintaining dark skies for astronomy and environmental impacts

once rosemonts permits are received a sky brightness monitoring plan oversight committee will be
created to monitor all pertinent data from the operations should any impacts exceed expectations the
committee will make recommendations for corrective action the committee will be comprised of experts
from the astronomy community and the lighting industry and representatives from both the forest service
and rosemont

                                                  studies in orchids




weve done a lot in the interest of the colemans coralroot hexalectris colmaneii a rare orchid found
growing in southwestern new mexico and southern arizona in part near the site of the proposed rosemont
mine

rosemont is contributing to the science and understanding of the plant

extensive surveys conducted by rosemont have expanded the known distribution of the species to over 15
locations in seven distinct mountain ranges in southeastern arizona

originally the colemans coralroot orchid was thought to have a very specialized habitat occurring only in
the bottoms of shaded canyons with dense oaks and then only in a few canyons in three mountain ranges in
southeastern arizona

rosemont has redesigned the mine plant site to avoid one location where large numbers of colemans
coralroot spikes have consistently been observed the area will be fenced to limit potential impacts from
disturbance the dry stack tailings position has also been realigned to avoid a second population known to
occur in the vicinity of the project consequently the project will directly impact small numbers of colemans
coralroot

overall our surveys since 2010 have greatly increased the understanding of the habitat range and relative
abundance of orchid spikes known to exist these surveys have also greatly expanded understanding of
what is habitat for colemans coralroot by documenting the orchid in areas that are strikingly different from
the large drainages originally thought to be a requirement for the species surveys commissioned by
rosemont have also documented several locations of a similar species hexalectris arizonica that had not
been known previously as well as a species of orchid hexalectris parviflora that was not previously known to
occur in the us

rosemont continues to survey areas in the vicinity of the rosemont copper project to document the
persistence of known locations of hexalectris species and search for additional locations rosemont has also
continued to monitor three locations where large numbers of orchid spikes are consistently found in order
to provide longterm data to look for trends in orchid numbers and correlations with climate and habitat
variables

environment
our approach
a number of environmental considerations govern our activity we are accountable under extensive environmental
commitments and to ourselves as well we know that mining must balance mineral development and the
surrounding environment

our strategies include

   planning and acting to minimize our environmental footprint at every stage of operation from exploration to
   decommissioning and closure

   maintaining iso 14001 environmental management system certification at all operating facilities and complying
   with towards sustainable mining tsm environmental protocols and thirdparty verification processes

   rehabilitating disturbed land to accelerate natural reclamation

   supporting community projects to minimize the aesthetic impact of our activities

our environmental management program consists of a corporate environmental health and safety policy and at
each site codes of practice regular audits the integration of environmental procedures with operating procedures
employee training and emergency prevention and response procedures dedicated teams are charged with
managing our environmental activities and compliance with applicable environmental standards and regulations

each operating facility both in canada and abroad must apply and participate in the tsm program for all locations
and activities where hudbay has operating control the management system must incorporate the elements of all
tsm protocols relevant to its phase of the mine lifecycle at operating sites this means achieving level a or higher
for all protocols within two years of startup

land and biodiversity
each site develops its own biodiversity management plan specific to its location the plans apply the biodiversity
mitigation hierarchy a set of prioritized steps to alleviate environmental harm as much as possible the four key
steps are as follows

   step 1 avoid impacts by locating facilities and access routes away from natural and critical habitats

   step 2 minimize impacts through the use of appropriate management systems and mine plan designs that limit
   land disturbance throughout the mine life

   step 3 restore ecosystems by progressively rehabilitating affected areas during operations and at closure with a
   goal of eliminating the impact over time through preservation or maintenance

   step 4 if needed offset residual impacts through programs to compensate for biodiversity losses when long
   term residual impacts cannot be avoided

hudbays biodiversity conservation standard sets out the minimum requirements for identifying environmental
conditions and managing biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services the standard is consistent with our
commitment to implement the tsm biodiversity conservation management framework and protocol

energy use and greenhouse gas
we use fossil fuels to extract and transport ore and electricity to run our processing plants our operations track
their energy consumption and associated ghg emissions we strive to reduce our impact by using energy as
efficiently as possible  for example by installing led lighting or ondemand ventilation systems that only run when
needed

air
we monitor and report air emissions to comply with air quality laws and regulations in the countries where we
operate

water
our commitment to continuous improvement leads us to identifying opportunities related to water management
and to updating our waterrelated risk assessments

we design waterefficient operations and continuously monitor our consumption and discharge while maintaining
our commitments to local users and regulatory agencies within the jurisdictions where we operate

each of our sites  and each community in which we operate  has different water needs and challenges depending
on the supply demand and water quality in the area prior to developing a project we assess water quality and
availability as part of our feasibility and environmental impact studies these assessments also consider the water
needs of local communities mining site designs and management plans incorporate water considerations
throughout the entire mine lifecycle

hudbay submits an annual water report to the cdp formerly called the carbon disclosure project which can be
accessed from the cdp website

waste and tailings
all hudbay operations have waste management plans to reduce reuse recycle and responsibly dispose of waste
waste rock from our mines and tailings from processing plants are a particular priority

waste rock mined rock that does not have economic value is managed onsite according to strict and detailed
environmental regulations and industry standards wherever possible it is reused as fill in underground operations
to construct tailings containment structures and for site rehabilitation

tailings are the finely ground rock trace metals and process chemicals remaining after ore has been processed we
adhere to the tsm protocol for managing tailings where water is plentiful tailings have historically been piped into
secure engineered impoundments contained by tailings dams tsm guidelines address best practices for the
location design construction operation and closure of tailings facilities so that structures are stable and comply
with industry and government standards and solids and water are properly managed in accordance with the tsm
protocol our tailings management design and practices in saskatchewan and manitoba and at constancia are subject
to independent review processes ranging from dam safety reviews every five years to biannual independent peer
review board assessments

rosemont plans to construct a stateoftheart drystack tailings facility which can significantly reduce
environmental impacts compared to traditional tailings facilities learn more about drystack tailings on our arizona
environment page

closure and reclamation
in all jurisdictions where hudbay operates mining companies are required to plan for closure before the start of
operations and provide financial assurance to relevant regulatory agencies for proposed mine reclamation activities

once mining is finished we aim to leave behind land that will support natural ecosystems and productive uses we
follow the guidelines set out in the tsm framework on mine closure which consists of eight key elements ranging
from effective and sustainable closure planning to consultation with communities continuous improvement and
monitoring of reclamation programs

in addition to the tsm framework hudbays mine closure planning in peru is guided by ifc performance standards
and by peruvian mine closure regulations

closed mine site activities are tailored to applicable regulatory requirements and the characteristics of each site
they can include monitoring activities and adaptive management strategies to ensure the effectiveness of the
reclamation activities until such time as reclamation objectives are determined in consultation with regulators to be
complete

environment
manitoba
our manitoba operations are located in the canadian shield in a sparsely populated region of bedrock bush lakes
and swamps recognized worldwide for its mineral deposits the region is treasured by many for its stark and rugged
beauty throughout hudbays history we have carefully closed and remediated 19 mines in the region returning
most of the land to the way it was long before we arrived

minimizing our footprint
from exploration to closure we seek to keep our environmental footprint as small as possible

one of the best examples is our reed mine the mine is located within the boundary of a manitoba provincial park
by design there is no mill or tailings facility from the start we collaborated with the manitoba authorities to ensure
the mine did not affect the local caribou habitat  including only clearing trees on seven of the 14 hectares our
permit allowed even then trees were removed selectively and the wood was given to the provincial park for use as
firewood the main fan was installed underground and soundreducing enclosures were built for generators
compressors and the ventilation heater reed employees are trained on how to avoid scaring caribou and we have
implemented manitoba sustainable developments postcard system for reporting caribou sightings to support
research efforts

as mining progresses at reed we will need backfill material to stabilize the underground workings we have an
agreement with provincial authorities to use acidgenerating waste rock from a nearby former mine site by moving
this material to our site and then underground the potentially negative environmental impacts of this material will
be mitigated

using resources wisely
while fresh water and clean hydroelectricity are abundantly available in the region we strive to use water and
energy as efficiently as possible for the past several years our manitoba operations have worked towards a 1 year
overyear reduction in both water consumption intensity and ghg emissions intensity water consumption and ghg
emissions per tonne of production using 2014 as the base year

water usage is managed through water rights licences and related reporting discharge is managed at four discharge
points using sitespecific water treatment technologies and extensive water quality monitoring our environment
department tracks water quality data and reports to management on an exception basis

the manitoba business units total water consumption declined by 28 compared to 2015 despite increased
production water consumption intensity declined by 19 a good sign that our efforts to stress environmental
awareness and promote the reduced use of water materials and other resources are taking hold

we started working on water recycling projects to further reduce our use of fresh water the projects would enable
us to draw water from the clarification pond and from the tailings facility to use in the flin flon mill




hudbay 2016 annual and csr report                                                                                           66

while we use renewable hydroelectricity to run the                           water consumption
processing plants we need propane and diesel in the                             intensity
mines for heating and for extracting and transporting ore
in older mines reducing fuel consumption becomes more                       m3tonne of production
difficult because of the need to dig deeper and haul
material further which also means more underground
workings and ventilation are required

despite the challenges we reduced our overall energy
usage by 27 and our energy intensity by 32 compared
to the 2014 base year we also met our annual ghg
target reducing emissions by 32 from 59965 tonnes
co2e in 2015 to 58065 tonnes co2e in 2016

change often comes in increments through simple
improvements for example in 2016 there was a
concerted effort to improve equipment productivity by
implementing hot changes this means that when a
driver of a vehicle vacates his or her seat for a lunch break
or the end of a shift somebody else immediately replaces
the person rather than have the vehicle idle vehicles are also shut off when they are not being used this focus had
the spinoff benefit of reducing ghg emissions per tonne of product moved

added responsibilities at snow lake
with lalor mining and processing operations in full swing and potentially expanding our environmental
responsibilities have grown and will continue to do so in 2016 we hired environmental specialists at snow lake to
oversee activities and manage regulatory compliance

permitting is underway for an expansion of the anderson tailings impoundment area near snow lake we conducted
community consultations in 2015 and filed our application with the provincial government in 2016 we hope to begin
construction in early 2018

were planning to build a paste backfill plant that would enable us to use stall mill tailings as backfill in the lalor
mine rather than sending them to the anderson tailings impoundment area this is considered an environmental
best practice that would help with water quality on the anderson tailings and reduce the expansion requirements of
the tailings facility government approval to proceed with this project was received in january 2017

hudbay assumed additional environmental responsibilities with our 2015 acquisition of the new britannia gold mill
which is currently on care and maintenance there is ongoing active treatment of the tailings on site and monitoring
and sampling requirements have been added which are being managed by our new environmental specialists

dust flareup prompts action
air emissions from our manitoba operations in flin flon are typically minor and related to vent and fugitive dust
emissions a dust management plan has been honed over many years and ensures that particulates remain below
regulatory limits

in 2016 highly unusual weather conditions created a tailings dust flareup in flin flon the situation did not breach
provincial health standards or reach the community hudbay manitoba took immediate action to contain the flareup
and notify relevant authorities snow and dust fencing was installed and wooden pallets were placed over the
affected area we also called neighbours to see if they were impacted in any way since then weve taken the
precaution of installing geotextile material over future potential dust sources

later in the year the saskatchewan government conducted a legal compliance audit for our past five years of
operation at flin flon which included the 2016 dusting event in their findings the auditors commended hudbay for
our effective dust management plans and actions taken during unusual weather events

environment
peru
our constancia operations are located high in the andes mountains of southern peru in a region renowned for its
rich mix of minable materials

focus on water
mining operations need water  as do communities and ecosystems

to support efficient water use we run studies to understand how much water enters the watershed and how much
we can use for our operations without interfering with the requirements and needs of the communities and the
natural environment we also monitor the water quality of the rivers near constancia to assess any impact that our
activities may have on the environment this is particularly important during the rainy season when water volumes
increase

in 2016 we strengthened our water management systems and controls this included implementing flow metres
and standard methodologies for measuring rainwater to improve compliance reporting to prevent leaks to
waterways we took a close look at critical parts throughout the mine and processing operations and put in place
additional engineering controls where needed in preparation for the rainy season normally from november to late
marchearly april all sediment management controls were inspected to ensure that everything was in good working
order

water balance studies conducted in 2016 revealed that there was enough water to meet our commitments without
the reservoir at the same time the communities were asking for additional assistance because of recent drought
conditions we are developing an action plan to address these needs

energy efficiency improvements
as a first step toward setting environmental targets we rigorously tracked energy use water use and ghg emissions
in 2016 to establish baseline data sets

when it comes to energy use and ghg emissions the main challenge is that the amount of energy needed varies
significantly depending on the type of ore being mined at any given time  making it difficult to meet targets as a
result were focusing our initial reduction efforts at the worker accommodation camp where we have more control
over consumption one of the first actions will be to retrofit lighting to energyefficient led technology

putting waste to good use
the camp is also where we plan to implement water reduction targets and organic waste diversion projects we
currently compost organic waste for use in our revegetation and forestation programs and are studying other
diversion options

partners in biodiversity conservation
in peru were committed to ensuring there is no net loss of biodiversity as a result of our activities our biodiversity
action plan bap was developed in line with international standards towards sustainable mining and ifc for
protecting and conserving biodiversity the plan covers management of protected plant species rescue and
relocation of threatened animal species wetlands management and revegetation programs most of the activities
are done in partnership with the local communities and integrate ancestral knowhow where possible

for the past two years weve hired sustainability consultants to work with community users as part of a bog
management and sustainable use plan designed to promote the conservation of the land the team has helped
farmers plant oats on dry land plots so their cattle can graze there during the dry season instead of using the
wetlands theyve also built irrigation trenches for grasslands outside the bog area and improved water catchment
structures and systems in 2016 they started training the farmers on how to care for the cattle in this new
environment

during 2015 we implemented a program in which community members are paid for collecting native grass seeds
and helping with progressive reclamation of disturbed areas our efforts were recognized in 2016 by snmpe
national society of mining petroleum and energy as an innovative progressive reclamation practice

taking action on dust
keeping dust levels down on our property and along the concentrate transportation route is important to us and to
our community stakeholders at times weve used water to suppress dust but have not found it to be as effective as
dust suppressants in 2016 we initiated a competitive bid process for a dust suppressor contractor to meet our
needs during the 2017 dry season

environment
arizona
the rosemont project is located in southwest arizona in the santa rita mountain range and is intended to be a
showcase for sustainable mining once built

water conservation
water is a concern in arizona and the importance of good water management has been prioritized in the rosemont
project design

we will employ stateoftheart techniques and processing technologies including process water recovery and the
development of drystack tailings with drystack tailings tailings are dewatered through filtering and built into
dense durable dry stacks that do not require a dam for retention drystack is a proven tailings technology that uses
about 50 less water and less land than conventional tailings containment design and reduces the potential of
environmental impacts to groundwater by nearly 90

to further conserve water resources and biodiversity we established the rosemont copper conservation lands
program this program includes mitigation proposed in the permitting process as well as additional areas that
hudbay has set aside for conservation purposes hudbay arizona will permanently conserve more than 4827 acres
of open land and allocate more than 19 billion gallons per year of private surface water rights to the public once
finalized this program will establish secure sustainable habitat for bats birds fish frogs and other animals
including some endangered species

protecting endangered and special status species
weve committed to funding a variety of mitigation measures detailed in the rosemont environmental impact
statement and the rosemont biological opinion to protect endangered and special status species this includes
aquatic and bird species conservation activities salvaging and replanting agave plants a food source for an
endangered bat avoiding specific sites to prevent plant species impacts implementing jaguar and ocelot
monitoring programs and providing financial support to the forest service to hire a biologist for the term of
conservation to manage funds and monitor results see the arizona social impact page to learn about our financial
commitments related to these efforts

in 2011 a wild jaguar was observed in the santa rita mountains near the rosemont property and there have
subsequently been intermittent sightings of a lone jaguar in the mountain range with the most recent being
october 2015 the us fish and wildlife service has designated approximately 764207 acres in arizona and new
mexico as critical jaguar habitat the rosemont project would take up less than 07 of that land and only one
eighth of that amount would be occupied by the actual mine

we engaged large felid big cat experts to guide us in developing a plan for surveying and monitoring for the
presence of jaguars covering a 200 square kilometre 77 square mile area these efforts include the use of 150
cameras approximately one to three camera sets for every 26 square kilometres 10 square mile trail plots and
specially trained dogs with their handlers monitoring will commence before any significant surface work begins at
rosemont and continue for up to five years after the life of the project

in issuing its final biological opinion in 2016 the us fish and wildlife service noted that the rosemont project would
not jeopardize the existence of 12 species living on or near the proposed mine site

healthy air
use of leadingedge technology will help control dust and air emissions and ensure compliance with all federal and
state air quality standards for particulates and air pollutants our air quality permit issued by the arizona department
of environmental quality in 2013 and upheld by the arizona court of appeals in 2016 includes enforceable limits for
regulated air pollutants equipment testing and opacity measurements as well as extensive monitoring and
reporting requirements

we plan to use haul trucks and mining equipment that meet the highest emissions standards tier iv and high
efficiency dust collectors at process plant emissions points we also plan to pave access and plant roads enforce
speed limits transport employees to the mine in naturalgas buses and conduct concurrent reclamation of perimeter
buttresses and disturbed areas in order to minimize dust and protect air quality

csr performance data
basis of reporting
all financial information is presented in us dollars except where otherwise indicated all operating data is reported
using the metric system some metrics are reported on both an absolute basis and an intensity basis against
kilotonnes of metal processed safety data frequency rates are measured per 200000 hours worked

data measurement techniques
data is measured or estimated and operations are asked to explain significant deviations in yearoveryear trends
the performance data is reported at a mix of operational and corporate levels data is checked and approved at the
site level and also reviewed for consistency by the corporate data collection team

we provide safety and environmental incident definitions so that all operations report incidents consistently we
calculate greenhouse gas ghg emissions using published factors for emissions

most of the performance data for water and energy is metered we purchase most of our electricity from local grids
utility grid statistics are therefore used to compile purchased electricityrelated ghg numbers we generate
electricity at some of our project sites such as constancia and reed and this energy is reflected in fuel
consumption while ghg numbers are calculated based on conversion factors

data for the indicators is collected and compiled using information submitted by each site on a standard template
we provide instruction and criteria for gri g4 and towards sustainable mining tsm and also supply a ghg
emissions worksheet developed by the mining association of canada mac
