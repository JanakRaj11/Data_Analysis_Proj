        reducing waste                                               promoting the recycling of resources

    considerably reduced the volume of paper used via a           for them currently employees are requested to bring

    personally held documents                                   articles while nurturing a sense of recycling among our
      we also endeavor to reduce waste volume by using            employees
    longer product life led lighting devices adopted at
    several locations
      moreover in the rd departments waste was
    previously produced by actually assembling prototypes
    now we work to reduce the waste volume by
    repeatedly verifying the relevant processes in a virtual
    space that take advantage of 3dcad systems in the
    product design field

        adhesivefree speaker unit
       regarding ecofriendly product design we focused on developing an
       adhesivefree bonding technology by reviewing the structure and materials
       for the parts that had been adhesivedependent
       the adhesivefree technology brings advantages such as hazardous vocs
       reduction and labor cost reduction for the assembly of speakers
        volatile organic compounds



        lightweight speaker for invehicle use
       we developed a lightweight speaker which is optimum for nextgeneration
       ecofriendly vehicles such as electric vehicles evs we reduced by more
       than 20 year over year the weight of the speaker which is 17 cm in
       diameter and weighs as little as 190 g while restricting the suppression of
       its sound pressure level a fundamental performance for speakers its
       advanced design has taken into account reducing overall co 2 emissions
       from vehicles
       its frame is made of a specific polypropylene pp material we have
       succeeded in reducing the frame weight while maintaining practical
       strength through profile optimization
       we use adhesives that do not contain harmful solvents in view of reducing
       the volume of vocs remaining inside the passenger cabin of vehicles
       diaphragms and center caps which are made of recyclable paper also
       have the high waterproofing required for speakers for invehicle use

        headphones and head sets
       also for headphones and head sets we have been active
    in incorporating environmental considerations in our product
    andor process design as for the reduction of substances in
    our products that present an environmental burden we
    respond to the most uptodate information regarding
    countryspecific legal requirements and the rohs2 to
    promote proposals to our customers and dissemination to all
    the group companies we have reduced energy consumption
    in manufacturing and the volume of raw materials that would
    be disposed of as waste in addition we have continuously
    moved ahead with measures such as minimizing the volume
    of waste materials the reuse of raw materials by introducing
    new equipment and product development using natural
    materials we also address the manufacture of more eco
    friendly products with less use of solder andor adhesives
                                                                                                                                                         18
