      case study

      you be the chemist challenge
      the you be the chemist challenge ybtc is an interactive
      science competition in the usa which encourages 5th  8th
      grade pupils to take an interest in chemistry and its applica
      tions in everyday life for nearly ten years brenntag north
      america and its employees have sponsored and supported
      this programme which was initiated by the chemical educa
      tion foundation in 2004 this questionandanswer competi
      tion begins at a local level in almost 40 federal states in the
      usa the top pupils from each state then face one another in
      a national final by participating children not only improve
      their knowledge of chemistry but also develop their learn
      ing communication and time management skills and boost
      their selfconfidence in a playful competitive environment

      brenntags commitment to ybtc goes way beyond financial
      support every year our employees recruit new schools to
      participate in the programme we help the children to pre
      pare for the competition through special study guides and
      chemistry sets for experiments and by visiting schools at
      the events at local and state level brenntag employees take
      care of the organizational and catering arrangements act as
      hosts and jurors and support the children as they progress
      through the competition they therefore develop a strong
      bond with the young participants on their path together and
      share in the thrill of every decision
