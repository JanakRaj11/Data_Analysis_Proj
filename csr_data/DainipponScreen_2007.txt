corporate taxes companies also contribute to society with the        television crts and lc production equipment so we feel we
products they provide in our case we help advance the worldʼs       should give back to society by helping the visually impaired in

equipment for semiconductors lc and pcb production                         another small way in which weʼve contributed is to recognize
equipment and printing and prepressrelated equipment another       our identity as a kyotobased manufacturer by honoring the green
way we contribute is with the stable hiring demand we create in       reputation kyoto has acquired as the site of the
the local communities we do business in aided by our aﬃliates and    internationallyrenowned kyoto protocols weʼve planted greenery
corporate partners all of our various contributions to local         our business sites and created a garden in our glass screen plant

             groupʼs largest development base
             white canvas rakusaiʼs vision of the future

             a technologydriven development environment
             with the transfer of the semiconductor equipment division to
             the taga plant the rakusai site was reborn in march 2006 as
             white canvas rakusai the groupʼs largest development
             base and a gathering point for technology development staff
             development departments spread over four internal companies
             were brought together in a single location creating an
             environment that greatly facilitates discussions and opinion
             gathering
                    what is white canvas rakusaiʼs mission when it was
             divided into separate internal companies dainippon screenʼs
             core technologies were considered separate from the unique
             technologies of the companies creating applications for them
             and differences in core technology areas arose as time passed
             white canvas rakusai was created to bring these areas
             together and evolve them into new core technologies
                    the center is currently working on three areas 1
             applying core technologies to the products each internal
             company is working on and providing support for their
             development 2 developing new technologies and business
             areas driven by core technologies and 3 improving computer
             simulation technology and optical technology through funda
             mental research for advancing core technologies this last area
             will require a steady ongoing effort



            developing customeroriented products
             during the product development process white canvas
             rakusai carries out five design review dr phases numbered
             from 0 to 4
                   dr 0 is the idea phase in which the product has yet to
             take shape the engineers discuss the design elements they
             want the product to have in line with the development policy
             naturally developers need to consider the customerʼs perspec
             tive so along with drawings and blueprints they need to listen
             to customer feedback gathered by the sales team at trade
             shows
