energy saving programme
an energy saving programme esp is currently in operation at gab the purpose of this
programme is to ensure there is a comprehensive and systematic approach to reducing utilities
consumption it requires us to measure control optimise and monitor all the natural resources
related processes inorder to achieve the desired target against the brewerys ubm utility
benchmark module target all these are to support the tpm total productive management
concept which was implemented by the company several years ago

another important agenda for the company is the continued focus on reduction of electricity
thermal energy and water consumption to improve on our environmental impact based on
heinekens utilities benchmark models according to our records we were able to reduce our
electricity consumption against our target however we were not able to do the same for thermal
energy and water due to a lower production volume last financial year hence the economies of
scale that come into play
