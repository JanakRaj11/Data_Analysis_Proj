  strategic sustainability issues
the outcomes of the strategy workshop and sustainability questionnaires we realized with participation
of our senior executives employees and customers allowed us to better understand our triple impacts


as a result of the evaluations with our executives in the strategy workshop we examined and
exemplified the matters of strategic importance to our company in economic environmental and
social terms separately and built the mars logistics sustainability matrix




on the top righthand side of the table are the issues with higher significance to both our stakeholders
and our company compared to other matters and headings which affect directly and substantially
the credit legal financial and operational performance of our company these being the main titles of
the related sections of the report the performance of our company has been provided in detail within

                                                                                         wwwmarslogisticscom   19

        economic performance
     becoming a reliable and preferred brand with customer satisfaction and reducing our unit costs with
     operational efficiency is the foundation for our strong economic performance

     operational efficiency

     according to 66 of our employees participating in the sustainability questionnaire
     mars logistics has systems to conduct its operations with the highest efficiency

     it is substantial in the logistics sector where competition is intensive to create a difference and
     perform our business more effectively and efficiently since operational efficiency ensures optimal
     use of all of our resources particularly human resources it reduces our costs

     the customer demands may vary in parallelism with the varying marketcompetition conditions our
     operations may be affected occasionally from external factors such as road condition strike and
     customs in such cases we review our processes and revise when necessary the fact that we do
     necessary it investments our dynamicyoungqualified team support of the senior management our
     skills to manage change and crises facilitate most efficient management of our operations

     we actively carry on our constant improvement and development studies to increase our
     operational efficiency in our strategy map we prepare on the basis of balancedscorecard rationale
     as a result of the strategic planning meeting we arrange every year we update our targets under
     four main headings financial customer processes human resourcessubstructure

     our tools for operational efficiency
     quality circles a community consisting of our voluntary employees of 3 to 7 people conducting
     studies for problem detection development and generalization of a solution proposal the purpose
     of the quality circles is to improve the business environment increase quality and efficiency reduce
     costs toward all or part of the main and supporting processes

     project groups they consist of senior and middle managers and operational personnel between
     3 to 15 people project groups pursue studies involving longterm different processes generally
     affecting the main activities of the company and toward problems and requirements based on
     system formation

     workshops they are a group study approach designed for analysis of the subjectmatter in a
     participatory environment for synthesizing of opinions in order for common decisions on certain
     subjects and arranged for drivers and blue collar employees

     comparative works in processes prioritizing improvement these are studies aiming at constant
     improvement seeking the best or investigating better finding learning and adapting to the personal
     processes

     mars logistics has sufficient systems and substructure to ensure confidentiality of its customer
     information



     although we have departments for gathering evaluation and solution of the customer notifications

     and reliable operation and started our efforts by establishing a project group

     we register and follow our customer information over soft software system the system is available
     to authorized persons only situations such as access to or changing of information by other means
     are out of question besides all data of the company are protected with necessary security software
     and hardware thanks to our it department we also target at obtaining iso 27001 information
     security certificate in the prospective reporting period to render our efforts more reliable about the
     issue

     responsibility of the transported commodity
     we are responsible to the extent set by the international cmr convention in flaws originating from
     mars logistics since cmr land transportation certificate is provided by our company in land
     transport as forwarder we are successively responsible per international rules in air sea and
     railroad transports acts of god are excluded

         environmental performance
     we evaluate environmental sensitivity as an obligation and shape our activities both administrative
     and operational to minimize our impacts within this context

     energy efficiency and co2 emission reductions

     according to 73 of our employees participating in the sustainability questionnaire
     the environmental sensitivity of mars logistics vehicles is sufficient

     the energy resources we are to use in the course of our activities are electricity illumination ventilation
     elevator use and forklifts natural gas heating and dining hall needs as well as gasoline and diesel oil
     vehicle forklift and generator fuel we target at increasing energy efficiency by consuming less of the
     energy resources because the reduced emission earned as a result of energy efficiency has direct effect
     on the nature

     we are using fluorescent lamps in all office illuminations at our headquarters we use 14 w electronic
     balances and 18 w mechanical balances in offices led illumination will be used in our new headquarters
     we plan to move in 2014 fossil fuels are mostly used for electricity generation in turkey as mars logistics
     we purchase the electricity power we consume in our offices from voytron firm generating electricity in
     hydroelectric power plants and natural gas combined cycle plants since 2007 consequently we
     supply some of our office needs from renewable energy resources

     the forklift trucks at tuzla and avcılar locations run on electricity we are using diesel forklifts in yenibosna
     headquarters and all our forklifts in our new headquarters will be electrical the most important reason
     of this modification plan is that electrical forklifts are more environmentfriendly and healthy in closed
     areas because they dont release co2 gas electrical forklifts cause less noise pollution with less risk of
     breakdown and better in terms of costs

     55 of our employees participating in the sustainability questionnaire and 58 of our customers
     indicated that the most important subject of environment requiring management in mars logistics is
     reduction of co2 emissions and climate protection the subject significant for our key stakeholders is also
     strategically significant for us we target at further bringing up in the prospective period calculation of
     our carbon emissions and preparation of our company for iso 14064 standard




                                                                 electricity consumption gj

the reason why our electricity consumption increased in 2012 is the increased number of our employees
and air conditioners and other electrical devices added

     a 31 reduction occurred in our natural gas consumption as a result of positive seasonal conditions

     2012 is the increased number of our vehicles


     our most important natural resource further to energy resources in the course of our activities
     is water we mostly use water for cleaning and washing of vehicles we can also use it for fire
