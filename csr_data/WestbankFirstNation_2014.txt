to essential information when trouble shooting any equipment malfunction or breakdown if
repairs are not presented in a timely manner it outlines the authorities to call the action plan to
correct and that the water purveyor is advised of any emergency situation in this case as for
most first nation communities the water purveyor is chief and council wfn utlities directly
manages and maintains operations on their behalf the plan delegates authorities and provides
administration supports to the operators so that a quick response that is predetermined can be
undertaken this plan was put in place when the water system was commissioned however it
was outdated and unmaintained eﬀectively since 2009

next ﬁscal year utilities staﬀ will be focusing on developing a maintenannce schedule for wfn
facilities and overviewing system capacity in order to determine future cosumption volumes a
uv system is also set to be installed this system will add additional disinfection for the water

expenses rose signiﬁcantly faster increasing 28 million from 313 million to 339

net financial assets declined 13 million in 2014 to 388 million from a previous      finance staﬀ brian provides
year balance of 401 million the major reason for this down tick was due to the        a wide range of accounting
spending of 54 million on capital projects such as housing sidewalks roads and      reporting and planning services
new equipment transfers from own source revenue reserves for dividends new             he works to ensure transparency
