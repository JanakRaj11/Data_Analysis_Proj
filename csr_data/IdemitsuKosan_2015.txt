east beginning with the nissho maru incident wherein we challenged the seven sisters the nickname given to the group
of western oil companies that dominated the market at the time and imported petroleum products directly from financially
strapped iran after the chiba refinery came on line in 1963 procuring crude oil for local refinement became our primary
focus in 1973 with control over middle eastern crude oil shifting from the seven sisters to the oilproducing countries
themselves we established offices in beirut tehran and other locations in the middle east to strengthen our direct ties
with those countries and secure crude oil and petroleum products even now our network of offices in the middle east
functions as our principal point of contact with oilproducing countries in fiscal 2014 we held ceremonies to celebrate the
35th year of trade with qatar and the 30th year of direct crude oil trade with oman

 coal mines
demand for coal relatively inexpensive and found in regions with low geopolitical risk is expected to continue to grow
especially in asia
   idemitsu currently owns interests in four australian coal mines boggabri ensham muswellbrook and tarrawonga
we expect production from the four mines to amount to 11 million tons in 2015 although the coal we produce is sold
mainly in japan taiwan korea and other parts of east asia we also supply customers in india and southeast asian
countries we market the coal produced at these mines mainly in such east asian countries as japan taiwan and korea
in addition to promoting sales in india and southeast asia
   to meet growing demand for inexpensive lowash lowsulfur coal for use in coal fired power stations we have
acquired a 30 share of a coal company holding interest in the malinau mines in indonesia we are also strengthening
relations with customers and reshuffling our coal asset portfolio by transferring part of our interest in the boggabri mine to

     response to biodiversity



     initiatives undertaken by our refineries petrochemical plant and tokuyama complex


     actively promoting the greening of factories since the construction of our first refinery

idemitsus initiatives to promote the greening of factories can be traced back to the construction of its first refinery the
tokuyama refinery in shunan city yamaguchi prefecture completed in 1957 these earliest efforts predated the factory
construction law by 17 years it was not until 1973 that faced with significant environmental pollution generated during
the countrys postwar period of accelerated industrial growth japan passed a law requiring the creation of green spaces        the importance of factory green spaces in terms of biodiversity
in his planning of the refinery founder sazo idemitsu aimed to create a plant that would be valued by the public so he
introduced advanced environmentfriendly technology such as japans first desulfurization equipment to remove the sulfur       seges evaluations confirm that idemitsus green spaces play an important role in fostering communication between its

content from kerosene and diesel oil moreover aiming to not disrupt the majestic scenery of setouchi attention was paid      business sites and their local communities they also confirm that the green spaces function as carbon sinks and provide

to the color and placement of the refinery and an expansive green belt resembling a western style garden was created            habitat for wildlife on the advice of experts and to foster biodiversity we periodically thin out the undergrowth and have

to separate the facilities from its urban setting the completed tokuyama refinery amid its landscaped grounds was in           recently begun to plant saplings in the resulting clearings in our planting we prioritize local species and aim to nurture

such harmony with its natural surroundings that it was eventually nicknamed the parkland factory the vision the founder      our green spaces as woodlands comprising regional vegetation furthermore we monitor bird and other small animal

brought to this project informed the subsequent construction of other refineries and petrochemical plants at present the      populations general public access to our facilities is restricted because the refineries petrochemical plant and tokuyama

hokkaido chiba aichi and tokuyama business sites manage green spaces that account for a total of 240 hectares or the         complex handle hazardous materials because of this the green spaces also function as sanctuaries for birds and

     recycling of catalysts2

our refineries use approximately 2000 tons of catalysts annually in the process that removes sulfur from heavy oil used
catalysts with reduced desulfurization activity are regenerated by an outside contractor and used again at our refineries
utilizing regenerated catalysts allows us to reduce the use of new catalysts by about 20 moreover these used catalysts
contain rare metals like molybdenum and vanadium when used catalysts cannot be regenerated we sell these as
valuable resources

2 catalyst a substance that accelerates a specific chemical reaction without being modified consumed in the process catalysts play an
     important role in the production process of petroleum products and petrochemical products




     recycling of petrochemical products

departments handling plastic processed products are promoting the development of easily recycled products made from
singleplastic resins and from recycled materials we have also established a recycling system for used plastic containers
these containers are used as ink containers and for other purposes

                                                                                                     idemitsu unitech recycle products


     reducing waste at service stations

we distribute our service station industrial waste management manual to idemitsu service stations to ensure compliance
with relevant laws and regulations among the waste generated at service stations empty plastic lubricant pails are
collected by an outside specialist company for partial recycling into resources used tires are collected for recycling by tire
sales companies and industrial waste hauling companies while used batteries are collected for recycling by the lead acid
storage battery recycle association

and undertaking purification measures by fiscal 2009 the group completed onschedule surveys at about 1300 sites
including refineries petrochemical plants oil depots idemitsuowned service stations and idle land at those locations
where we discover any contamination we place priority on preventing the impact of this contamination from spreading
