responding to the needs of society
with our technologies
we have striven to enhance the benefits for society as a whole through devoting our
efforts to construct buildings and structures utilizing various technologies in other
words we have helped deliver value and quality through our work to improve safety
comfort and convenience in modern society we believe that an environment can be
changed by making an ordinary building into a landmark which serves as a hub for the
daily activities of the surrounding communities by creating buildings conscious of the
environment and ecosystem local surroundings can also be further enriched
moreover by building infrastructure such as bridges and roads we create
revolutionary change in the transportation system that enables travel at even faster
speeds and in safer manners than before buildings once they are occupied and
utilized may be taken for granted but their existence which improves peoples daily
surroundings and convenience helps enhance the quality of life of society as a whole

efficient use of our limited energy resources
from energy saving to energy efficiency
while an important theme combating global warming may have been perceived as an
issue that lacks a sense of tangible results or achievements in 2010 the law
concerning the rational use of energy was revised while the tokyo metropolitan
government also enacted an ordinance aimed at reducing the total amount of
greenhouse gas emissions by large business locations and announced its plan to
institute even tighter regulations in 2015 all building owners will inevitably need to
act to address impending changes in laws ordinances and regulations with an
approach that embodies comprehensive technologies suited to the entire lifecycle of a
building amid this the great east japan earthquake struck causing a significant
change in the circumstances surrounding the supply of energy most notably electricity
kajima is committed to reducing and rationalizing its use of energy and helping
achieve energy efficiency while maintaining a comfortable lifestyle and work
environment through its next generation technologies

  response to the great east japan earthquake
  immediately following the great east japan earthquake kajima established a disaster response headquarters
  at its head office and tohoku branch this organization confirmed the safety and whereabouts of employees
  and ascertained conditions at factories in operation in addition it began damagerelated surveys on
  production facilities and structures based on client requests in response to a request for assistance from the
  tohoku branch we organized the shipment of relief supplies including water food and blankets from both
  the tokyo head office as well as each branch office throughout japan by the end of march 2011
  approximately 250 truck loads of relief supplies had been shipped to disasteraffected areas with almost
  2800 requests for damagerelated surveys by the end of april some 5000 engineers from the tokyo head
  office and branch offices were dispatched to the disaster zone to assess the extent of damage and restore
  production facilities and infrastructure such as the tohoku shinkansen bullet train line and highways
  furthermore the general manager of the tohoku branch also spearheaded the recovery and reconstruction
  efforts by leading the industry as the director of the japan civil engineering contractors associations
  tohoku branch kajima is firmly
  committed to building a platform for the
  recovery effort in order to help restart
  operations at manufacturing facilities that
  supply parts to major manufacturers and
  avoid a prolonged downturn in the
  japanese economy
  the japan civil engineering contractors association was
  renamed the japan federation of construction contracts on

  practicing safety first as an organization and as individuals

  i have spent the last 30 some years working primarily on dam construction sites
  i believe that a dynamic worksite that acts as a single organization helps us achieve
  higher quality work and discover better construction methods for example this entails

                                                                                                                                                                                                working together with local communities
  not only moving forward with the construction process by following the plan made by
  kajima employees but also leveraging the knowledge and experience of our
  subcontractors to eliminate potential dangers and find more efficient ways of doing
  things this worksite organization also heightens worker awareness toward safety by
  ensuring each and every worker practices safe behaviors i also believe it is equally
  important for the head office and branch offices to work seamlessly to manage
                                                                                                                         naoki tajima

               being a company that people are proud to work for




safety and health management at construction sites
daytoday work is performed according to mid and longterm construction plans as well as more refined weekly and daily plans each based on a
comprehensive review of the entire project construction site safety management entails a detailed examination into the movements of people
heavy machinery and materials that provides for the greatest efficiency safety and quality



     risk assessment
from construction planning to the start of actual work risk assessment should estimate the risks of a disaster or accident occurring by identifying
dangers or hazards at multiple stages in a variety of work processes
     risk assessment requires prioritizing methods to mitigate risks found after evaluating inherent dangers and hazards then executing measures
and keeping detailed records following new project review committee meetings kajima performs risk assessments during the formulation of the
construction plan and at the construction preparation committee and preconstruction review committee particularly before any heavy structural
beam construction begins in addition safety patrols undertaken by the head office and branch offices are also part of this risk assessment process
by using the knowledge and experience of many different people as well as having the maximum number of people perform visual checks of the
worksite we are able to enhance the validity of our safety management at multiple stages before during and after construction



     response to emergencies
in the event of an accident incident or fire an immediate response is required that first involves notifying related organizations and cooperating
with them internally and externally in order to ensure a prompt response an emergency contact list is made accessible onsite from the start
of construction



     a typical day on a kajima construction site
each day on a kajima construction site begins with a morning meeting involving all workers in which the days schedule is outlined and safety
notices issued after the meeting workers head to their area of assignment the subcontractor foremen and employees form teams and perform the
work according to the relevant plan and schedule while kajima employees inspect and oversee the worksite to ensure quality and safety as the
day progresses plans and preparations are carefully made for the next stages of construction


shared safetyfirst planning and mentality
realistic safetyfirst approaches are essential in construction planning we share detailed work procedures with subcontractors as well as plan and
execute with greater accuracy using our combined knowledge and experience




                                               a construction workflow meeting




  recognition of excellent engineers and technicians
  starting in april 2000 kajima instituted a special benefit and incentive system for excellent engineers and technicians known as the e award this award is
  presented to foremen or exceptional engineers or technicians that have been involved in a kajima construction project for more than six months have shown
  particularly noteworthy results and have set a strong example for others in 2010 628 employees received this award in 12 branches in japan of which 160
  have received the award for three consecutive years

kajimas overseas construction and development businesses are run by six locally incorporated subsidiaries located in five regions around the
world including the united states while the companys international division is in charge of its overseas civil engineering business today nearly

of the global real estate asset bubble and faced an extremely challenging operating environment as a result of our steady efforts at business
development rooted in local communities however we have been able to build up an overseas presence second to none among japans major

consideration of our next mediumterm targets for fiscal 2012 onward with great changes taking place throughout society including a
rethinking of longterm energy supply and demand planning after the recent disaster and new international cooperative frameworks to
combat global warming we will make kajimas role and its aims clear and straightforward

    priority issue 1 global warming prevention                                  priority issue 3 hazardous substance management
our targets are to reduce co2 emissions over the life cycle of              we will undertake proactive and voluntary initiatives to strengthen
structures from construction to dismantling to 30 below fiscal           our management of soil contamination and other constructionrelated
1990 levels and co2 emissions from construction per unit of value        environmental issues in dealing with new issues we will introduce
to 16 below fiscal 1990 levels by means of design we will                our own standards as needed regardless of whether regulations are in
