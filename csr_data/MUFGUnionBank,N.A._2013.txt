           in our eyes it means reflecting the values of the        environmental impact including a lighterweight
      communities that surround us it means responding              paper for bank statements composed of 100
      to them with a spirit of service it means a drive to          percent sawmill residue

letter from julius robinson
union banks corporate social responsibility efforts continue to grow along with our business
creating positive change in our communities and deepening those connections among our
employees customers neighbors and partners our 2012 csr report illustrates a broad cross
section of environmental economic and social contributions that together represent the best of
union bank and i believe reveal the character of our business and employees
    our dedicated csr team works closely with the business units of union bank and a wide
range of partners and stakeholders to coordinate and leverage our community efforts a reflection
of our commitment creativity and drive union bank results far exceed what one might expect
from a bank of our size
    in 2012 we reached or exceeded goals in many key areas including community
reinvestment actrelated loans and activities employee volunteer hours donations from the
union bank foundation and reducing greenhouse gas emissions per square foot of real estate
meanwhile we are focusing our attention and energy on those areas where more progress is still
needed
     looking to the future i am particularly enthusiastic about our fresno community economic
development initiative a multifaceted project to leverage the full resources and expertise of
union bank as well as those of our partners to benefit the economically distressed city of fresno
california organized in 2012 and launching in 2013 our threeyear commitment exemplifies the
innovation and heart that make union bank a unique institution
    this is the second csr report that adheres to the framework of the global reporting initiative
gri adopting this standard promotes transparency and accountability with regard to union
banks community progress which we believe will strengthen trust in our institution from the
partners and stakeholders we rely on for our success
    thank you for your ongoing support and interest in our work

closings impact on the surrounding community
these steps include developing alternative financial

     union bank has set a goal of
reducing normalized greenhouse gas
intensity by 9 percent by the end of
2013 compared to 2008 levels we are
well on track to accomplish that goal
     our progress is the result of a
variety of technological advances
green practices and policies innovative
thinking and mindfulness on the part
of our workforce in 2012 we launched
a variety of new capital projects that
included lighting upgrades in 117 of
our branches in california and the
installation of powersaving software to
our computers we also spearheaded
a variety of additional steps to                                                                                             paper consumption
