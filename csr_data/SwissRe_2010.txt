     of the multicat mexico transaction this is an insurancelinked security that provides the
     mexican government with protection of up to usd 290 million from the capital markets

     countries multicat mexico was the first transaction completed under the new
     programme it is highly innovative in that it covers multiple risks  earthquakes and
     hurricanes both on the pacific and the atlantic side of the country

     the world bank and other organisations recognise that effective risk transfer solutions
     can have significant benefits for developing and emerging countries which are often
     strongly exposed to natural catastrophes in the event of a disaster the government of the
     affected country usually has to absorb a large part of the financial costs and is frequently
     forced to borrow money reallocate budget positions or raise taxes transferring
     catastrophe risks to the capital markets helps ease the pressure on public finances and
     ensures that rapid funding is available for relief efforts after a disaster

      carbon nanotubes  an emerging risk
      nanotechnology is an umbrella term for a wide range of technologies relating to
      materials with dimensions of 100 nanometres 1 nanometre  1 billionth of a metre or
      one millionth of a millimetre or less among the most prominent nanomaterials are
      carbon nanotubes cnts cylindrical structures resembling a rolledup piece of nano
      scale chicken wire composed of carbon atoms cnts have about 100 times the tensile
      strength of steel at one sixth of its weight these extraordinary properties make cnts
      potentially useful for many applications in electronics optics construction and others

      particular types of multiwall carbon nanotubes mwcnts have a long fibrous
      structure and a needlelike shape similar to asbestos there is a risk therefore that if
      released to the air and inhaled they may have similar effects as asbestos early proof 
      of principle studies though not perfect have led to some regulatory action and
      precautionary measures

      given the present uncertainty surrounding mwcnts the insurance industry needs to
      consider a number of possible preemptive risk mitigation steps eg raising clients
      awareness mapping their risk exposure analysing cnts whole lifecycle and
      developing appropriate underwriting measures currently the risks related to certain
      types of mwcnts are a moving target and need to be monitored closely major
      developments can be expected over the next decade

      carbon nanotubes were also the subject of a cro risk briefing published in 2009
