of the solarworld vision we confirm our claim to achieve                      and waste we use and save per unit produced furthermore
this goal strong competition and high cost pressure cannot                   we set an emissions target for new cars in our vehicle fleet
deter us from thinking and acting sustainably because
this is what distinguishes us from our competitors as a                      if we succeed in achieving the targets set before 2020 we

macroeconomic risks 
 risks
 1 weak economic development unstable economic conditions lower private consumption
     decreasing willingness to invest tighter financing terms and increased inflation risk
 2 falling domestic electricity prices delays in solar power becoming competitivereaching grid parity slowdown in tapping new markets
 probability
 1 medium overall the world economy improved in 2015 and is expected to continue its expansion in 2016 according to the kiel institute for
     the world economy however the levels of national debt in a number of european countries remain high which could threaten the stability
     of the euro as well as the economic trend in the euro zone geopolitical conflicts in eastern europe and the middle east could also have a
     negative impact on the economic and financial situation in general the weak economic development in the emerging countries might slow
     down the growth of the world economy too
 2 medium falling costs of primary sources of energy are hardly being passed on to electricity consumers with the result that declining oil
     prices have little impact on the domestic electricity price furthermore energy prices should rise in the medium term on the basis that
     energy demand will continue to grow
 effect strength time horizon
 1 medium shortterm to longterm a decline in the general wilingness to invest might have a medium effect on our group revenue and
     earnings largescale projects would be affected the most by a tougher financing environment since in the short term credit bottlenecks
     could occur for largescale investment projects and especially for project financing a weak economy in emerging countries such as china
     may reduce the price level of solar products because of exchange rate effects
 2 medium mediumterm domestic electricity prices have a medium impact on our business since end customers may choose between
     selfproduced solar power or power from a utility company ie the electricity generation costs of a solar power system are compared with
     domestic electricity prices
 countermeasures
  trade our internationalization helps us spread the risk of a decline in consumption among various regional markets reduce
    by offering a diversified range of products we appeal to various customer groups to spread the financing risk and compensate for shifts in
    demand reduce  future sales markets  p 083
  all segments due to ongoing cost reductions and efficiency enhancements along the entire value chain we are able to offer solar systems at
    competitive prices thus the levelized cost of electricity of solar plants undercuts domestic electricity prices in a number of markets already
    and continues to get closer elsewhere assume

political and regulatory risks 
 risks
 1 changes in laws promoting solar power slower market growth due to a reduction in or even abolition of financial incentives in individual
     countries
 2 discontinuation of countervailing duties in the us and in the eu unfair trade practices would no longer be monitored and sanctioned
     rapid price decline due to dumping
 probability
 1 low economic incentives for new solar technology installations are regularly reviewed by policymakers and in many cases reduced
     in important sales markets for the solarworld group such as the united states germany france the united kingdom and japan in
     solarworlds most important sales regions new legislations were passed by the end of 2015 so that there is a low probability of further
     changes in 2016  the future market 2016  p 081
 2 low on february 1 2015 new antidumping and countervailing duties came into force in the united states which complement the existing
     duties on solar products imported from china these determinations will be effective for the next five years the level of the us duties is
     revised every 18 months in the european union the eu commission also opened an investigation regarding an extension of the anti
     dumping and countervailing duties imposed in europe this procedure may take up to 15 months so that a decision is not to be expected
     before early 2017 until then existing antidumping and countervailing measures remain in force
 effect strength time horizon
 1 high shortterm to mediumterm a reduction of incentives for new installations of solar power technology may have a negative impact on
     the willingness of customers to invest such declines in demand may lower our revenue in individual regions and have a negative impact on
     our earnings as long as grid parity has not been achieved in individual markets solarworld will be exposed to this risk
 2 medium mediumterm to longterm massive price decline due to dumping could significantly diminish our sales volumes or make it
     impossible for us to sell our products at a costcovering price level this would negatively impact our revenue and result
 countermeasures
  trade we spread this risk across several markets by means of our international presence reduce  future sales markets  p 083
  all segments development and sales of solar power solutions that enable customers to reach a high degree of selfconsumption and
   that are thus profitable even without or with decreasing feedin tariffs reduce  enabling greater independence  p 041

risks arising from alternative solar power technologies 
 risks
 technological breakthrough or sharp cost reductions in alternative solar power technologies risk of substitution for crystalline technologies
 probability
 low due to continuing low prices for crystalline solar products few manufacturers of alternative solar power technologies have cost benefits
 versus crystalline manufacturers this particularly applies to the roofmounted systems market as alternative solar power technologies only
 have low module efficiency making optimum use of limited roof space more difficult
 effect strength time horizon
 medium longterm successful competitors might reduce our market share increase price competition and thus place stronger pressure on
 margins this might adversely affect our revenues and earnings
 countermeasures

risks from tougher competition 
 risks
 intensification of competitive pressure continuation of consolidation at all stages of the value chain in the solar industry increased competi
 tion from statesponsored manufacturers unfair pricing practices excess capacities dumping
 probability
 high due to rising capacities in the solar industry competitive pressure persists which could lead anew to a strong decrease of sales prices
 in spite of legal measures antidumping and countervailing duties and undertaking concerning minimum prices in the us and eu against
 violations of international trade law the danger of unfair competition still exists as some market players sell below production costs
 on a longterm basis to drive competitors out of the market a lot of competitors have a higher investment power thanks to state support
 some have announced that they will significantly expand their capacities mainly for high efficiency technologies such as perc therefore we
 presume the probability that competitive pressure will increase to be high
 effect strength time horizon
 high mediumterm to longterm loss of market share failing profitability and increased negative margin trends due to stronger international
 price competition may weigh down revenue and earnings if competitive pressure in the solar industry increased anew the implementation of
 measures to enhance business profitability would become much more difficult

    or poor quality
2 costs of purchasing other raw materials silver copper aluminum etc on the rise higher procurement costs
    strong speculative fluctuations  particularly for silver aluminum and copper inaccurate hedging
3 deterioration of procurement conditions suppliers could reduce their payment termscredit limits for solarworld or only deliver after
    advance payment
probability
1 low we maintain supplier agreements with a silicon supplier that secure our supply at competitive conditions in the medium term in
    addition procurement on the spot market at good condition is possible currently in the medium term our joint venture will make an
    additional contribution to our silicon supply
2 low the kiel institute for the world economy expects that raw material prices will remain low in 2016 because of the weak economy in
    emerging countries
3 medium since the operating turnaround has not been completed yet some suppliers could reduce their credit limits and payment terms for
    solarworld or only make deliveries subject to advance payments
effect strength time horizon
1 high shortterm to mediumterm silicon is the main raw material used to manufacture crystalline technology supply bottlenecks delayed
    deliveries or quality defects could halt production which would have a negative impact on revenue and earnings
2 medium shortterm higher prices for other raw materials might negatively impact earnings and margins
3 medium shortterm liquid funds would be temporarily tied up deliveries subject to advance payment could mean that the solarworld

corporate strategy risks 
 risks
 misjudgments concerning future developments bad strategic decisions with regard to investments disinvestments technology development
 location decisions acquisitions and joint ventures financing organizational structure and business model
 probability
 medium the solar power industry is subject to frequently changing economic political regulatory and technical influences to which the
 companies have to adapt flexibly and quickly in the meantime technical entry barriers are comparatively low so that the solar industry is a
 narrow market with a lot of competitors which often act in an unpredictable way in this environment it is hard to measure the impacts of
 longterm strategies and corresponding business models reliably
 effect strength time horizon
 high shortterm to longterm due to the fact that the solar industry is capitalintensive the economic consequences of possible wrong
 strategic decisions are to be measured as high lack of acceptance or profitability of new products might affect revenues and earnings of the
 company loss of market shares image and capital resulting from this might worsen the economic position of the group

default risks 
 risks
 insolvency of individual customers loss of receivables outstanding
 probability
 low our customers consist mainly of a large number of wholesalers and installers who essentially are not affected negatively by the high
 competitive pressure in the solar industry moreover they are benefitting from the dynamic growth of the solar market therefore we assess
 the general risk of loss of receivables outstanding to be low
 effect strength time horizon
 low shortterm the loss of receivables from individual customers would only have a small impact on our business as we have a very broad
 customer base and none of our customers accounts for more than 10 percent of our revenue
 countermeasures

sales and price risks 
 risks
 continuing or increasing price pressure and supply surplus lower demand for our products
 probability
 medium price pressure in the market may intensify as a result of competition and changes in the legal framework in core markets less
 favorable incentives and financing conditions for purchasing solar power systems could lead to drops in demand on the market antidumping
 measures could be relaxed or circumvented customers could decide to buy products from competitors overall demand for solar products
 is rising dynamically throughout the world which implies that the relationship between supply and demand might normalize however the
 devaluation of the yuan in early 2016 may have a negative effect on the international average selling prices for solar products because most
 solar manufacturers are located in china overall we consider that the probability of this risk occurring is medium
 effect strength time horizon
 high shortterm to longterm if less than the agreed volumes of our products are purchased or if prices drop this could mean that we are
 unable to sell our products at a costcovering price furthermore impairments on inventories may be necessary which would adversely affect
 earnings not only could a steep drop in demand diminish revenue it could also result in a lower utilization of our production and negatively
 impact unit costs as well as margins and affect the intrinsic value of the production facilities it could also increase our storage costs any
 unexpected shift in demand regionally or to another customer segment could negatively affect achievable sales revenues and margins and
 produce deviations from expected earnings

 risks
 shortage of highlyskilled technical and executive staff difficulties in filling key positions high attrition rate
 probability
 high the availability of highly qualified technical and executive staff in the labor market is declining while competition for talent is growing
 the consolidation that took place in the solar industry negatively affects the appeal of solar companies as employers
 effect strength time horizon
 medium mediumterm a high fluctuation can be an obstacle to the implementation of optimization measures a shortage of skilled technical
 staff can lead to a potential erosion of our technological edge and slowdown in corporate growth this may adversely affect revenue and

 impact on our operating cash flow and diminish our liquid funds too high inventories can tie up liquidity too
 2 medium since december 31 2015 additional covenants apply to solarworlds loans that have to be met at the end of each quarter based
 on the companys current business planning the management board expects to be able to meet these covenants for the full year 2016 in the
 first and second quarter of 2016 headroom for deviations is more limited than in the second half of the year increasing the risk of breaching

legal risks 
 risks
 1 litigation between a silicon supplier and our subsidiary solarworld industries sachsen gmbh solarworld industries sachsen gmbh is
     currently the defendant in court proceedings with the silicon supplier hemlock semiconductor corp which asserts claims resulting from the
     nonfulfillment of longterm silicon supply contracts
 2 infringement of loan agreements the contracts regulating the companys borrowed funds contain extensive obligations and conditions as
     well as partly imprecise legal terms that are open to interpretations individual creditors of borrowed funds have a different opinion with
     regard to the groups interpretations of some contract points
     ther pending litigation and proceedings individual court or administrative proceedings in which third parties claim rights against
 3 o
    solarworld especially regarding our us subsidiaries
 4 other legal risks there is a wide range of tax competition patent antitrust labor law trade mark and environmental regulations within the
     scope of our international business operations infringement of which may cause costs
 probability
 1 low according to external legal opinions there are antitrust concerns under european law regarding the effectiveness of the underlying
     supply contracts which could mean that the purchasing obligations of solarworld industries sachsen gmbh are null and void from
     solarworlds perspective the supplier is therefore not entitled to claim damages in addition solarworld industries sachsen gmbh has
     further substantial lines of defenses against the validity of the claims however the district court for the eastern district of michigan in
     which the case is unfolding at first instance ordered on october 28 2015 to deny a motion to allow illegality under european antitrust
     law as a line of defense in the proceedings the partial decision of the court is of technical nature and is no assessment that the underlying
     agreements do not violate eu antitrust law all other lines of defense remain allowed however the order lowers our chances to win the
     lawsuit in the first instance

        in case of a negative ruling in the first instance there will still be the possibility of appeal in the united states and the defense of illegality
        under eu antitrust law can be reconsidered at that stage in addition a potential us ruling has to comply with the essential principles of
        the german law in order to be recognized and enforced in germany thus a german court would have to reassess a potential ruling if it
        were to be enforced in germany at the latest at this stage the illegality of the underlying agreements due to infringement of eu antitrust
        law would become relevant again therefore even in case of a negative ruling in the us solarworld continues to assess the probability for
        hemlock to actually enforce any claims against solarworld as low
 2 low solarworld believes that its interpretations are in accordance with the contractual basis and all contractual obligations and conditions
     have been complied with therefore it has not infringed any loan agreements however one group of creditors has expressed doubts regarding
     the companys interpretations of specific contract points especially regarding the calculation of covenants as well as possible transactions
     requiring approval
 3 medium based on the respective states of proceedings currently it is to be expected that financial costs will be incurred as a result
 4 low solarworld is not currently aware of any further material risks from litigation patent infringement or other legal risks that might
     significantly impact the business situation of the company as a result of our global sales presence however risks could in principle arise in
     connection with legal disputes relating to trademark usage
 effect strength time horizon
 1 high mediumterm to longterm if us courts legally ruled that hemlock semiconductor corp is entitled to claim for damages against our
     subsidiary solarworld industries sachsen gmbh and if this decision could be enforced this would have a considerable negative impact on the
     companys liquid funds possibly even threatening the continued existence of the company as a going concern
     note 42 contingent liabilities  p 168
 2 high shortterm if this risk occurred creditors of borrowed funds would have an extraordinary right to terminate loans this would require
     renegotiation of the loan agreements or its terms and conditions since the amount of loans affected exceeds the companys liquid funds an
     exercise of the creditors extraordinary termination right would threaten the continued existence of the company as a going concern due to a
     then insufficient cash position
 3 medium shortterm a ruling sentencing to pay damage claims or an outofcourt settlement could have adverse impact on the earnings
     financial and asset position of solarworld in the consolidated financial statements as at december 31 2015 provisions in the amount of
     usdollar 3 million were made to account for these circumstances however it cannot be ruled out that depending on the further course and
     outcome of the proceedings higher financial charges might be imposed

     companys reputation and brand and cause losses of tangible and intangible corporate property

	since 2015 the calculations have been carried out using furtherdeveloped methods databases and conversion factors to ensure that the results
    remain comparable with those for 2014 these figures have also been adjusted retrospectively
	the emissions data which takes account of the corrected levels following the volkswagen emissions scandal is not currently available we therefore
    use the original data for our calculations




the starting up of crystallization results in a deterioration in               of our modules there the environmental target set for 2020
groupwide co2 emissions per watt peak previous scope3                       has already almost been achieved in 2015
emissions now fall within the scope2 range this can also
be seen from the cumulated energy demand for the lifecycle
