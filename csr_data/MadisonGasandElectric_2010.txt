    growing renewable energy
    mge continues to be an industry leader taking new steps with
    renewable energy we exceed our current renewable portfolio
    standard requirements and already surpass the 2015 require
    ment set by the state of wisconsin

    in 2009 mge delivered more than 375800 megawatthours
    of renewable energy to customers this includes energy pro
    duced from solar methane gas and wind

    solar
    mge works to develop solar installations in the community by

            installing our own systems mge owns operates
            maintains or helps maintain more than 20 photovol
            taic pv systems including 10 systems on area high
            schools
            using an innovative program to encourage customer
            participation

    and sell the energy back to mge due to customer demand we         renewable sources
    increased the amount of solar generation in the program
    more than three timesfrom 300 kilowatts to 1 megawatt mw
    in 2009 the solar energy is part of mges overall green pricing
    program

    pv systems are expensive to purchase and install clean power
    partners helps address that expense and make it more feasible
    for businesses and residents to invest in solar energy since the
    program began in 2008 customers have installed more than
    100 solar units

    as a result of these efforts mge recently was ranked 4 in the
    central us region for annual total solar watts per customer by
    the solar electric power association

    methane gas
    landfills produce methane gas which is a greenhouse gas that
    is 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide co2 methane
    would typically be burned off into the atmosphere but it can
    be captured and used as fuel since 2001 we have purchased         mge owns and operates solar systems to

    mge purchased 275 million kilowatthours which is enough

wind energy
mge currently owns two wind farms and purchases wind power                     mge wind capacity
from independent projects we have grown our wind capacity
from an 11mw wind farm that we built in 1999 to our present
wind capacity of 137 mw part of this wind energy is mandated                                  137 mw
by state law and goes into our overall electric mix for customers
the remaining wind energy is above and beyond that mandated
amount and supplies our green power tomorrow program

green power tomorrow
mge challenges customers to increase their commitment to
conservation with its green pricing program we expanded
green power tomorrow in 2008 and by the end of 2009 the
number of customers in the program increased 160

green power tomorrow gives customers the option to purchase
clean energy by paying a little extra on their monthly electric
bills in 2009 green power participants saved more than                           11 mw
172000 tons of co2 and other air emissions

green power tomorrow received the 2009 utility green power pro                    1999          2009
gram of the year award from the us department of energy and the
environmental protection agency it recognizes mge for expanding
its wind power program


  customers value renewable energy opportunities

  more than 200 business customers participate in green power
  tomorrow and are featured on mgecommarketplace they find
  value in green energy

      being green is what its all about we want to feel better
      about what we do and set an example for the industry using
      green energy is a key piece of the puzzleit costs a bit more
      but the positive impact it can have makes it worthwhile
      ole olson isthmus engineering  manufacturing cooperative

      the green power tomorrow program shows our dedication to our community and is a simple way for
      consumers to support renewable energy just by doing everyday shopping its a way for us to lead by
      example and to show that every bit of green power can make a difference tim metcalfe metcalfes market

      we are pleased to be part of mges green power tomorrow program protecting the earth is a value we want
      the children to grow up with and supporting renewable energy is a great way to help teach that lesson

vehicle idling policy
mge implemented a new vehicle idling policy that directs
employees to turn off company vehicles and equipment when
not in use this practice helps
    reduce air emissions idling vehicles release nitrogen
    oxides volatile organics and greenhouse gases
    burn less fuel national studies show diesel and
    gasolinepowered vehicles can use fuel at the rate of
    up to one gallon per hour when idling
     minimize wear and tear on engines

prairie restoration
mge participates in a prairie restoration effort with the city
of madison and wisconsin  southern railroad the project
includes establishing prairie plantings along the capital city      a team of mge employees developed the
trail and railroad tracks from south blair street to south          vehicle idling policy which is tailored to
                                                                    mges operations it limits idling to no

                                                                    more than five minutes per hour under

                                                                    most circumstances
then reseeding those areas a controlled prairie burn and
additional seeding took place this year

prairie restoration increases plant diversity which attracts
native beneficial insects and other wildlife increased plant
diversity provides more nutrients to the soil than monoculture
plantings such as turf grass

in addition prairie grasses have deeper root systems which
aid in water infiltration and retention they also cut down on
surface water runoff and erosion which can be a problem in
urban areas pollutants that run off into prairie plantings are
removed before water enters groundwater or lakes and streams
prairie grasses also eliminate or reduce reliance on mowing
which decreases fossil fuel use and associated air pollution

     enhancing operations
     mge continues to green up its operations with environmentally
     friendly improvements to its facilities and transportation fleet

     facility improvements
     a major energy efficiencysustainability project that began in 2009
     is yielding significant results mge has been upgrading lighting
     and equipmentranging from its offices to its fleet garage

     improvements at mges general office facility already have
     saved 50000 kilowatthours of electricity this includes upgrad
     ing the building automation and lighting systems lighting
     upgrades included retrofitting numerous lights and controls
     removing unneeded units and installing occupancy sensors

     projects at other company buildings have cut energy use by
     up to 26 these efforts include lighting upgrades and occu
     pancy sensor installations additional projects are under way         mge uses 100 renewable energy for its

     hybrid utility trucks mge added two hybrid lineandpole trucks
     to its fleet this year typical bucket trucks require power from an
     idling engine to operate an aerial lift with mges new trucks a
     hybrid component operates the aerial lift bucket a vehicle that
     can operate its bucket mechanism without idling wastes no fuel
     and emits no pollutants

     mge is testing the feasibility of these vehicles for daily use in
     the field studies suggest commercial hybrid vehicles could
     improve fuel economy by 20 in addition to reducing green
     house gas emissions and smogforming pollutants

     electric facilities vehicle mges facilities department uses a
     small but rugged electric vehicle that has a halfton hauling
     capacity and can travel 30 to 40 miles between charges
