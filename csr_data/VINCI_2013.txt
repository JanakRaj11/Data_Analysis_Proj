                                                     strategy and outlook

combining growth
and resilience
the key to vincis strategy is the threeway
fit between its concessions business and its
contracting business the latter comprising
energy roads and construction in terms of
 operating cycles long in concessions and
short to medium term in contracting
 financial considerations concessions are
capital intensive and generate recurring
revenues whereas contracting requires
relatively little capital but is structurally cash
positive
 mutually reinforcing expertise programme
organisation and financing and project
management during construction and
operation in concessions and the capacity to
design build and maintain complex
structures in contracting
    this strategic model has served vinci well
since its inception underpinning its
expansion in times of economic growth and
providing resilience in a cyclical downturn
    vincis managerial culture combines
decentralisation and autonomy for its
operating subsidiaries with empowerment
for its managers and a networked approach
to operations these underlying principles
encourage individuals and groups to
perform to their best while making vinci
companies exceptionally responsive to
market conditions
    in todays uncertain economic climate
vincis first priority is to consolidate the         01
fundamentals underpinning its strategic
model its deployment across a broad array of
business activities and a growing number of
markets and regions is making it sturdier
than ever moreover the mediumterm
visibility afforded by the contracting
businesss order book allows these business
lines to adjust swiftly to cyclical shifts
in turn this responsiveness allows the group
to anticipate market developments

into the groups managerial reflexes

control of overheads and a ceaseless quest

     vinci park and buzzcar have joined forces to promote
     sustainable car use the innovative community platform
     buzzcar launched initially in lille and tourcoing and
     currently being extended to other large cities in france
     brings car owners and drivers together around a simple
     secure carrental service between private individuals
     you advise committees set up to promote innovation and tech
     nologies in a number of big cities around the globe on the issue
     of transport what do you think will be the main characteristics
     of the mobility of the future
     it will be multimodal most people in the rich countries walk out of their
     homes and immediately climb into a car however they are increasingly
     tending to live in urban areas where the car is not always the most effective
      or the fastest  way of getting around conversely it is definitely the most
     expensive running a car costs around 6000 a year and this cost is con
     stantly rising in future we will be able to choose our mode of transport
     depending on the nature of the trip walking cycling metro bus train and
     from time to time the car which we will pay for only when we use it in
     addition the size and characteristics of the vehicle will depend on the
     purpose of the trip a one or sixseater a van or scooter

     over 10 years ago you founded zipcar a pioneering car
     sharing service company in the united states what is the
     connection between it and the buzzcar service in france
     with zipcar carsharing is organised around rental of vehicles belonging to a
     fleet when we created this service customers often asked us why cant
     i have the convenience of a car near my home in my neighbourhood in my
     city it was an economic problem we couldnt guarantee a large enough
     return on investment per vehicle to be able to offer this service everywhere
     with buzzcar individual car owners rent out their own car so were capitalis
     ing on the excess capacity of cars belonging to other people a private car is
     unused 95 of the time on average if a neighbour rents it once a month its
     a straightforward profit for the owner carsharing can be organised every
     where in the city or elsewhere as for choosing france to introduce this
     solution it reflects the fact that france is ahead of the usa as far as
     multimodal transport is concerned

     you have joined forces with vinci park to develop buzzcar why
     did you make this choice
     vinci park car parks are everywhere  and theyre full of cars just sitting
     there so it was logical to think of vinci park in connection with a carrental
     plan i also liked the fact that vinci park had already begun thinking about
     developing services based on the new mobility solutions that are starting to
     emerge very few big companies in the automobile sector share my forward
     looking vision of transport and lastly i must admit that i was very impressed
     by the quality of customer reception and service in their car parks

     how would you sum up efforts to improve the safety of
     french nuclear facilities in the wake of fukushima and the
     aging of the power plants
     most of our nuclear power plants are approaching the 30year mark an
     age at which a number of components must be renovated or replaced
     even when they have undergone regular maintenance this is what is we
     call a major refit clearly it would not be prudent to invest in such a large
     operation if it is only to extend the lifespan of the fleet for 10 years so we
     will be aiming for 20 to 30 years we have therefore identified  and this
     was done before fukushima  the safety improvements needed at power
     plants when they reach the age of about 40 including the addition of a
     third set of electrical circuits and an additional water supply system
     these changes will bring us close to a number of safety objectives
     specific to thirdgeneration reactors
     in light of the lessons learned from fukushima and the recommendations
     of the french nuclear safety authority these changes will have to be
     brought forward and scheduled by 2018 in parallel with the major refit
     operations to be carried out on a substantial part of the facilities during
     the 20122025 period we are preparing for this work we cannot do it
     alone of course we need the support of a solid industrial fabric and have
     presented a number of projections to all our partners including the vinci
     group

     against that backdrop how are edfs requirements
     expected to change
     edfs technical requirements will remain unchanged the real challenge
     will be to cope with the retirement of a substantial portion of the
     workforce that built the power plants we will have to cope with the
     generational transition at a time of intensive work edf and its partners
     will have an equal need to renew skills and we will all have to work
     together intelligently to meet this challenge from that point of view
     vinci energies is an important partner though its name is less familiar in
     the power plants than the names of such companies as cegelec tunzini
     and kellal vinci energies has the capacity to set up and coordinate
     responsive handson teams and to provide the strong support they will
     need if they are to expand at a time when activity is sharply increasing as
     it will be shortly

     what role do you think a group like vinci can play in build
     ing newgeneration power plants and decommissioning the
     oldest facilities
     the set of core competencies in maintenance operations and upgrades
     that vinci is developing for the major refit are the same as the ones that
     will be needed for new construction and decommissioning going forward
     the partners that are currently working with us day to day will be called
     on in future thirdgeneration reactors may constitute a technological
     leap and introduce new safety requirements but to build them what is
     needed above all is an industrial fabric that has managed to take new
     skills on board

     the london borough of hounslow awarded a consortium
     comprising vinci concessions and ringway eurovias uk
     subsidiary the upgrade repair and maintenance of its
     highways network for a period of 25 years the consortium
     will invest 125 million in the project


     what is the aim of this contract what is special about it
     our streets are generally in poor condition as weve made other investments
     over the last 20 to 30 years our purpose is to make the streets of hounslow fit
     for the 21st century its a quite complex contract and a longterm investment
     based on a private finance initiative pfi our partner vinci concessions and
     ringway will be borrowing 125 million with the majority invested in the first
     five years of the contract this investment puts the borough in a very strong
     position to be able to improve almost all of the streets in hounslow for the
     benefit of our 250000 residents during this core investment period vinci
     concessions and ringway will be upgrading the entire street infrastructure
     roads footpaths streetlights signs trees and so on beyond the initial period
     vinci concessions and ringway will then be maintaining everything for
     another 20 years up to the required standards

     how can the london borough of hounslow council measure
     these standards
     under the contract there are about 300 indicators on which the performance of
     vinci concessions and ringway is judged during 25 years they concern the whole
     range of services such as the condition of the highways and pavements condition
     of the street lighting which has to be brought up to standard the removal of
     graffiti the cutting of the grass verges along the streets and so on during the first
     five years there are a number of milestones that vinci concessions and ringway
     will have to achieve and we are confident that they will meet these standards
     following an exhaustive process to agree the contract

     what criteria influenced your decision in favour of vinci
     concessions and ringway
     we went through a very rigorous procurement exercise choosing vinci
     concessions and ringway as our partner for several reasons firstly the quality of
     the bid they made in particular they bring their knowhow and experience they
     also bring innovation in terms of use of materials that will greatly improve the
     appearance of our streets they have also been involved with this local authority
     for a long time as they have been working on a contract with hounslow for over
     20 years the council very much liked the quality and the ideas they brought to
     the project although they are a multinational company we appreciated their
     understanding both of the kind of service we provide our local communities and
     of what the people want out of a local highways service

     the millennium challenge corporation a us government
     agency funds poverty reduction programmes in low and
     middleincome countries engaged in a process of sustai
     nable economic development in 2006 mcc signed a
     307 million compact with benin some of the funds went
     towards financing the rehabilitation of the port of cotonou
     a project in which a consortium of vinci companies took
     part

     what sets the mcc model apart what for example are the
     main criteria used in the selection process
     mcc encourages candidate countries to carry out reforms to strengthen
     governance economic freedom and investment in human capital it uses a
     selection process based on performance as measured by some 20 indicators
     and identifies priorities and projects to be carried out by the recipient
     countries themselves which are responsible for implementation eligible
     countries must continue the reform process which is assessed annually and
     maintain or improve their overall performance as measured by the mccde
     fined indicators

     what criteria did the benin millennium challenge account
     apply in the selection of the vinci consortium to carry out
     the port of cotonou extension project
     the tender documents included environmental employment and occupatio
     nal health and safety clauses the bid submitted by sogeasatom and its
     partners judged technically sound with the best financial conditions met
     these requirements the work was carried out without a single serious
     accident the environmental clauses were also complied with for example
     for the extension of the sand trap about 375000 tonnes of rock were safely
     transported in compliance with local regulations over a distance of 150 km
     this involved about 12000 truck round trips and 20 trainloads since the
     structure was handed over six and a half months ahead of schedule
     mcabenin asked the vinci consortium to carry out other works in the port
     of cotonou zoning rail line car park lighting etc

     benin is eligible for a second mcc programme for which you
     are currently developing the content under what conditions
     will this new compact be signed what kinds of companies
     do you think best suited to support you in implementing this
     second contract
     the award will depend on the closeout of the first programme the conti
     nued success of the projects already completed and the way in which the
     eligibility criteria are met to implement the second programme companies
     should have a profile corresponding to the projects selected between now
     and the end of 2013 obviously their expertise reliability professionalism
     and experience will be major factors in the selection process

2            information on trends
21           outcome in 2012
              when publishing its quarterly results in october 2012 vinci set its targets as follows
              the good activity during the third quarter of 2012 combined with recent external growth transactions should lead to an approximate 4
              increase in the groups fullyear 2012 top line
              in terms of operating and net incomes despite the margin pressure being felt in some sectors and countries vinci was targeting levels close
              to those reached in 2011 before taking into account the new tax and social charges being considered in france
              ongoing discussions surrounding the proposed 2013 french finance law le projet de loi de finances 2013 imply that these new charges could
              negatively impact vlncls 2012 net income which could be down by 3 to 4 compared to its 2011 level

              vinci exceeded the above targets particularly following adjustments made to parts of the draft 2013 budget applicable in 2012

               unaudited figures

              on the date of publication of this document there have been no material changes in the groups financial and commercial situation since
              31 december 2012 other than those described in note b1 of this report



3            the groups markets seasonality of business
              most of the groups activities but particularly roadworks civil engineering and some concessions record lower business volumes in the first
              half of the year than in the second this is due mainly to less favourable weather conditions in 2012 the difference in revenue between the
              two halves was about 13

              the seasonality of the groups business is also reflected in the net use of cash in the first half which is attributable to the lower level of receipts
              during this period and the pattern of operating cash flows the majority of which is generated in the second half of the year group income
              and expenses in respect of ordinary activities that are of a seasonal cyclical or occasional nature are accounted for using the same accounting
              methods as those adopted for the fullyear financial statements income and expenses invoiced on an annual basis eg patent and licence
              fees are accounted for on a pro rata basis using an estimate for the full year

c      risk factors
        numerous internal and external risk factors may threaten the groups objectives as vinci operates in a complex and changing legislative
        regulatory geopolitical economic and financial environment
        however in accordance with the groups subsidiarity principle vincis decentralised organisation aims to assess and handle risks at the most
        appropriate level of responsibility subsidiary business line holding company depending on their criticality

        the general guidelines in conjunction with the resultant risk management and internal control systems of the group enable the reporting of
        information to the centre on the main risks and their treatment under this process the major group entities prepared a risk mapping in 2009
        and have updated it periodically this identified the main risk sources and the more significant events that could hinder the achievement of
        the groups objectives the consequences of these events are evaluated according to their potential financial human or reputational impact
        and the associated probability of occurrence preventive measures to reduce the probability of occurrence of such events and their impact
        have been implemented

        provisions are taken for likely risks including in particular possible losses on completion of construction projects as specified in notes 20 21
        and 23 to the consolidated financial statements

        unfavourable economic developments may lead to a decline in publicsector orders and privatesector investment and limit access to financ
        ing subsequently putting pressure on business volumes prices and the groups financial situation the adaptation of the groups products
        services and activities to changes in the economic climate constitutes the major challenge visàvis the operational financial legal environ
        mental and technological risks presented below



1      operational risks
11     commitments
        commitments connected to bidding or to the acquisition or disposal of businesses constitute the main risk factor faced by vinci companies
        in their various business activities concessions energy roads construction property
        risk identification and assessment are taken into account in cost estimates right from the bidding stage of each project budgets are then
        prepared and updated during the contract execution phase

111   bidding
        the group has set up a selective bidding policy which involves the application of longstanding control procedures for tenders before com
        mitments are taken projects presenting specific risks in particular those that exceed the thresholds stated in the general guidelines are
        reviewed by business line risk committees the vinci risk committee reviews the largest projects

        in the contracting business vinci energies eurovia vinci construction group companies through the work of their expertise teams seek
        to avoid project performance risks at an early stage through the terms and conditions of submissions and in particular the associated techni
        cal legal and financial commitments

        the groups diversity in geographical locations and customers  with some 41 of revenue coming from publicsector clients in the contracting
        business  also contributes to risk distribution at vinci construction france approximately 40 of revenue is generated by contracts that
        are individually worth less than 5 million the groups policy is to opt for high technical valueadded projects allowing its knowhow to be
        leveraged in countries where the environment is known and manageable furthermore these major projects are often carried out in joint
        ventures with other companies which limits the groups risk exposure

        new publicprivate partnership ppp and concession projects are systematically submitted to vincis risk committee for examination and
        approval in addition in order to limit commitments and the amount of risk capital invested by the group in special purpose vehicles these
        projects are generally developed in partnership with other companies and are substantially financed by debt generally with no or limited
        recourse against vinci

112   property commitments
        the groups property development activities are mainly carried out through its specialised subsidiary vinci immobilier this companys
        activities are concentrated in the greater paris area and frances main conurbations in 2012 these operations accounted for less than 2 of
        the groups revenue vinci immobiliers most physical commitments undergo systematic prior examination by the vinci risk committee
        and are subsequently subject to detailed reporting and regular followup by vinci immobilier some vinci subsidiaries may also participate
        in property development transactions as part of their construction activities most of which are in france these projects are systematically
        submitted to the vinci risk committee for prior examination and approval the groups policy is to undertake new projects only if the risks
        related to the property and construction are under control and if the presale rate is sufficiently high

113   acquisitions and disposals
        to limit the risks associated with the integration of newly acquired companies and to be able to apply the groups management principles in
        them vincis policy is to take a majority interest in acquisitions most proposed acquisitions and disposals are submitted to the vinci risk
        committee for approval the largest projects are also submitted to the board of directors following examination by the strategy and investment
        committee see paragraph 342 of the section entitled corporate governance contained in the report of the chairman of the board of
        directors on corporate governance and internal control procedures page 183

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                                 121




12           performance of contracts
121         general risks
              in all of its business lines vincis subsidiaries are exposed to risks that can affect satisfactory performance these relate to the following
              fields

              human resources management
              vincis success resides in the quality of its managerial model and its ability to attract train and motivate its employees group companies are
              exposed to events capable of affecting this resource employee departures difficulties connected with recruitment and training in key job
              functions management supervisory and specialist trades employees health and safety personnel costs and industrial action

              vinci considers the health and safety of its personnel and third parties involved with or affected by its operations to be a major priority it has
              therefore set up a health and safety policy which includes in addition to accident prevention measures actions relating to occupational ill
              nesses and pandemics

              vinci has set up a workforce planning system to handle the risks related to the availability andor suitability of technical administrative or
              financial staff at management white and bluecollar worker level this system is intended to anticipate future workloads and the resources
              needed

              detailed information on vincis social responsibility approach is given in the report of the board of directors  e social and environmental
              information on page 138

              cost increases
              vinci is potentially exposed to cost increases particularly in the prices of some commodities and materials examples include oil products
              steel and cement these issues are analysed for each core business in section 122 below commodities risk is also covered in section 23

              subcontractors joint contractors and suppliers
              the quality of work done by other companies working with vinci and sometimes their default may affect the satisfactory performance of
              projects given the diverse nature of vincis business activities and its decentralised organisation which reflects the essentially local character
              of its markets the group considers that it has little dependence on any given subcontractor joint contractor or supplier

              vinci companies usually guard against this type of risk by selecting partners carefully monitoring progress and taking any corrective measures
              needed during the project life

              security context and social political or economic unrest country risk
              given the large number of countries where the group operates some activities may occasionally be affected by industrial action various
              forms of political unrest riots terrorism armed conflict embargoes seizure of equipment etc as well as malevolent acts such as vandalism
              and theft on construction sites or criminal acts such as kidnapping

              vincis safetysecurity department makes information available to business lines to ensure the best possible preparation for work and travel
              and makes recommendations to ensure the protection of people and goods it can also be called on to conduct site audits andor implement
              regularly updated security plans moreover it intervenes within the framework of crisis management in particular for staff evacuation

              in addition to the aforementioned events malevolent acts may include cyber attacks and fraud attempts the groups finance department
              in conjunction with the safetysecurity department has set down the instructions to follow in such cases

              the economic situation in europe andor a slowdown in emerging economies growth could lead to a worsening of conditions in markets
              where vinci operates
              across its contracting business lines vinci generates over 57 of total revenue in france 85 in europe and more than 3 in north america
              in 2012 concessions generated 94 of revenue in france essentially vinci autoroutes 97 in europe and hence only 3 outside of europe

              or current operations see report of the chairman of the board of directors on corporate governance and internal control procedures page 188
              the various property operations conducted by vinci immobilier or vinci construction subsidiaries are handled mainly in france

              financial risk is analysed in paragraph 23

              natural events
              like any other company vinci may be affected by natural events eg earthquakes floods cyclones windstorms lightning etc which can
              interrupt operations or trigger the collapse or accidental destruction of group infrastructure assets under construction or in use such events
              may result in an interruption to business for the relevant entity and could also entail a substantial hike in the costs involved in maintaining or
              repairing facilities part of these expenses may be borne by insurance policies

              as for crisis management the actions to be undertaken and training provided entail alert procedures the triggering of crisis measures and
              the management of and exit from crises this central organisation is cascaded in the groups subsidiaries which have also set up their own
              crisis management and communication arrangements

122   risks specific to vincis business lines
        the vinci companies within each of the groups business lines are exposed to events the prevention control and daily management of which
        lie at the heart of their business

        concessions and publicprivate partnerships ppp
        some risks may remain with the granting authority in particular in relation to making land available however default by the authority cannot
        be ruled out risks connected with design and construction are generally transferred by the special purpose vehicles spvs holding the ppp
        or concession contract to the contractors in charge of construction financing risks however remain the responsibility of the spvs and their
        shareholders see section 24

        regarding concessions operation the main risks relate to changes in traffic levels or infrastructure usage and customerusers acceptance
        of tolling and toll charges whenever toll receipts account for virtually all the revenue traffic levels on motorway concessions are correlated to
        economic activity especially heavy goods vehicle traffic they may also be affected by fuel prices whether for heavy or light vehicles

        risks connected with changes in the legal and regulatory environment during the lifetime of contracts must be assessed on the basis of the
        contractual framework governing their terms this framework may or may not provide for compensation mechanisms applying in the event
        of changes in the legislative regulatory or tax framework or in the event of the contracts early termination

        concession companies toll increases in particular for motorway tolls are generally linked to inflation these companies are therefore exposed
        to a contraction in the inflation rate

        the groups reputation may be tarnished in the event of default in the quality of services provided maintenance of the road network vehicle
        recovery exceptional events management required performance levels

        a centralised system involving public order authorities has been established in vinci autoroutes to combat toll fraud

        for motorway infrastructure the cost of renewing surface courses the wear of which is related to traffic intensity is covered by heavy
        maintenance provisions as specified in note 213 to the consolidated financial statements page 244

        the main financial legal and regulatory risks are described in paragraphs 2 and 3 dealing respectively with financial and legal risks below

        contracting vinci energies eurovia vinci construction
        the relationship between the groups businesses and their clients may be deteriorated by unilateral decisions taken by the latter early contract
        termination or by their default late payments or even insolvency as such measures to manage contracts cash flow and components of
        working capital needs are set up and closely monitored

        obtaining official authorisations in particular planning permission environmental permits and acceptance certificates prior to commissioning
        may represent unknowns that are managed on a casebycase basis by clearly planning the various steps preceding the construction and
        acceptance of the structure

        the timetable andor construction cost can differ from bid estimates as both depend on a wide range of parameters some of which are dif
        ficult to anticipate such as
        ˇˇ weather conditions see natural events above
        ˇˇ changes in the cost of labour subcontracting materials commodities and energy see above
        risks relating to changes in costs are handled in different ways
        ˇˇ the use of revision clauses and the short duration of most contracts mitigate but do not eliminate unit cost inflation risk
        ˇˇ although vinci bears the risk relating to its own personnel costs directly the risk of hikes in outsourcing costs may be transferred to sub
        contractors and suppliers by means of fixedprice agreements with them

        commodity price exposure varies according to business activities oil prices mainly affect eurovia which uses bitumen to build roads fuel oil
        for industrial facilities and petroldiesel for its equipment fleet this risk is dealt with under market risks in section 23 it is worth noting that
        eurovia sources 37 of its aggregates from group quarries

        a lack of qualified personnel or inadequate staffing levels may lead to lowerthanexpected yields or design or construction errors leading to
        technical noncompliance quality shortfalls of the works and even accidents affecting individuals company partner employees or thirdparty
        individuals the works or other goods these damages associated with possible repairs to remedy these problems may give rise to additional
        costs and delays in completion the subsidiarys reputation may also be affected however this risk is reduced by the groups arrangements
        for recruiting and training operational staff see 121

        for large projects the technical complexity of the design and construction of unique infrastructure assets site constraints presence of
        underground utilities maintenance of traffic during works actions of local residents or other third parties and geological conditions may also
        represent significant threats

        some of the groups activities may also be affected by the environmental and technological risks described in paragraph 4

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                                 123




              property
              the groups property development activities are exposed to numerous administrative technical commercial and fiscal uncertainties that may
              result in delays or even the abandonment of some projects budget overruns and incertitude regarding programme selling prices



2            financial risks
21           counterparty risk and credit risk
              the group is exposed to counterparty risk stemming from contracts and financial instruments contracted with its financial partners should
              the debtor refuse to honour all or part of its commitment or be unable to do so counterparty risk may result in either a loss of value or a loss
              of liquidity the group is exposed to loss of value in its cash investments the acquisition of negotiable debt securities marketable securities
              financial receivables derivative instruments and guarantees or sureties received it is exposed to a loss of liquidity on the amounts of its unused
              confirmed credit facilities

              vinci is also exposed to credit risk in the event that a customer fails as described in section 122

              the group has also implemented procedures to manage and limit counterparty and credit risk as specified in note 235 to the consolidated
              financial statements page 256


22           liquidity risk
              group liquidity must be evaluated via its cash and confirmed unused credit lines

              the groups exposure to liquidity risk relates to its obligations to repay its existing debt disclosed in note 2221 to the consolidated financial
              statements page 248 to the financing of its future needs associated in particular with concession companies investment programmes see
              note 9 to the consolidated financial statements page 224 and with the groups general needs details of these obligations and the groups
              resources to meet them cash flow surpluses unused confirmed credit lines financial ratings etc are given in note 22 to the consolidated
              financial statements on page 245

              the group diversifies its funding sources by using the bond markets banks and supranational banking organisations such as the european
              investment bank eib details of these sources are specified in note 22 to the consolidated financial statements page 245 net cash is man
              aged in accordance with the provisions specified in note 2222 to the consolidated financial statements page 249 backed by reporting which
              specifies the yield of various assets and monitors the level of associated risks

              some financing agreements include prepayment clauses in the event of noncompliance with financial ratios and covenants these are
              described in note 2225 to the consolidated financial statements page 250 the thresholds imposed on these ratios were being complied
              with at 31 december 2012


23           market risks interest rate currency commodity and equity risks
              because of its level of net borrowings vinci is exposed to interest rate variations mainly in the eurozone relating to its floatingrate debt and
              to changes in credit spreads applied by lenders vinci is also exposed to currency risk stemming from its activities outside france however
              these risks are relatively limited because about 26 of revenue is generated outside the eurozone management of interest rate and foreign
              exchange risks is explained in notes 231 and 233 to the consolidated financial statements pages 251 and 254

              as stated in notes 122 and 234 to the consolidated financial statements a large share of the groups revenue is generated under shortterm
              contracts or contracts containing priceindexing clauses unprocessed raw materials form a relatively small proportion of cost structures as
              a general rule the risk on commodity price increases is fairly limited

              in the case of largescale contracts with nonrevisable prices commodity risks are assessed on a casebycase basis and managed whenever
              possible using suitable methods such as
              ˇˇ firm price agreements with suppliers for a given time period
              ˇˇ cashandcarry deals with supplies bought or paid for by the client at the beginning of the work project
              ˇˇ more marginally hedging derivatives based on commodity indexes particularly where the supplier uses a price review mechanism based
              on an index that can be hedged in financial markets etc

              equity risk relates to shares held by vinci adp assets to cover retirement benefit obligations and treasury shares this risk is described in
              note 232 to the consolidated financial statements page 254 and point 3 in note c3 treasury shares to the parent company financial state
              ments page 283


24	impact of publicprivate partnerships ppps and concession contracts on the groups
     financial situation
              following review by the risk committee of the business line concerned these projects are submitted to the vinci risk committee for exami
              nation and approval projects are generally carried out through special purpose vehicles spvs dedicated solely to the project these spvs are
              financed by loans made directly to them with little or no recourse against their shareholders backed by the future revenues or receivables
              while minimising the capital outlay the latter varies according to the nature of the risks involved eg traffic volumes and country the amount
              of project financing and the share of financing assured by the concessiongranting authority floatingrate debt raised by spvs is generally
              covered by fixedrate hedges for a very large proportion in accordance with the commitments made to lenders

124                                           report of the board of directors




3    legal risks
31   legal and regulatory compliance
      given the diversity of their activities and geographical locations the groups companies operate within specific legal and regulatory environ
      ments that vary depending on the place where the service is provided and on the sector involved

      in particular they must comply with rules on
      ˇˇ the terms of agreement and performance of public and privatesector contracts and orders
      ˇˇ laws governing construction activities and the applicable technical rules governing the delivery of services supplies and works and
      ˇˇ environmental commercial labour competition finance and securities laws


      with respect to concession operations the group is dependent on public authorities that may as is the case in france have the right to
      unilaterally alter the terms and conditions of public service ppp and concession contracts during their execution phase or even terminate the
      contract itself subject to compensation

      group companies operations could result in them being held civilly or criminally liable in france and other countries and in them bearing the
      financial or administrative consequences similarly group executives and employees may also be held criminally liable

      a large share of the risks of noncompliance is therefore likely to lie firstly with executives andor company officers and with employees to
      whom responsibility has been delegated

      business lines regularly hold awarenessraising and training sessions based on the groups code of ethics and conduct in order to limit these
      risks and in particular to prevent conflicts of interest and anticompetitive conduct the groups commitments are described in the social
      responsibility chapter page 159

      the financial risks relating to the potential invoking of group companies civil liability are covered by insurance policies described under para
      graph 5 insurance cover against risks see below

      the report of the chairman of the board of directors on corporate governance and internal control procedures includes a paragraph on
      compliance with laws and regulations in force page 179


32   contractual relationships
      all the groups business activity is based on contracts mostly subject to the laws of the countries where the project is carried out engaging
      the responsibility of the contracting parties
      disputes may arise during the performance of said contracts
      the groups policy is to reduce its exposure by negotiating in the proposal phase clauses in order to
      ˇˇ pass onto the client the extra costs andor delays stemming from changes in the clients requests
      ˇˇ allow project shutdown in case of nonpayment
      ˇˇ exclude indirect damages
      ˇˇ exclude or limit responsibility related to existing pollution
      ˇˇ limit its contractual responsibility for the total project to a reasonable percentage of the contracts price
      ˇˇ cap delay and performance penalties to an acceptable percentage of the contract price
      ˇˇ stipulate contractual provisions allowing for adjustments price time schedule to account for legal fiscal or regulatory changes
      ˇˇ obtain protection via a force majeure clause against political risk clients unilateral decision or for early contract termination
      ˇˇ obtain an international arbitration clause for contracts outside france


      detailed information on the principal disputes and arbitrations in which the group is involved can be found in section h of the notes to the
      consolidated financial statements page 265 these known disputes are examined on the date of approval of the financial statements and
      following the review by legal advisers the provisions deemed necessary are as the case may be constituted to cover the estimated risks



4    environmental and technological risks
      environmental risks are those that have an impact on the natural environment they may be directly linked to
      ˇˇ the occurrence of technological accidents
      ˇˇ the usage handling or transport of hazardous substances
      ˇˇ the emission or release into the air or water of toxic and hazardous substances waste or co 
                                                                                                     2
      technological risk which stems from human activity entails accidents occurring in industrial or nuclear installations


41   environmentally related economic and regulatory context
      the sources of environmentally related risks and opportunities are essentially concentrated in two fields
      ˇˇ the competitive market with opportunities generated by growth in client demand for renewable energy generation or for products that
      consume less energy low energy buildings
      ˇˇ legal and regulatory compliance resulting from international or national changes in environmental protection regulations which are often
      made stricter in particular to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or conserve biodiversity

      vinci 2012 annual report                                report of the board of directors                                                               125




              only one vinci facility is concerned by frances national greenhouse gas quota plan pnaq ii cifcs plant part of eurovia at fos sur mer
              near marseille an approved auditor verifies the regulatory quota compliance of emissions by no later than 15 february each year the co2
              emitted by the cifc facility totalled 171314 tonnes in 2012 due to a significant increase in production as in 2011 no co2 sales were reported
              in 2012 as with other environmental indicators these figures are calculated over the period from 1 october of year y1 to 30 september of
              year y see note on the methods used in social and environmental reporting page 166


42           environmental risks
              some eurovia businesses may face exposure to these risks which remain limited
              binder plants the use or manufacture of products that are potentially hazardous to the environment is subject to continuous monitoring and
              internal inspections by eurovias quality health safety and environment managers
              production and application of bituminous mixes the setting up of an environmental regulation intelligence group for bituminous mix plants
              enables the plant operators to take the action needed to ensure permanent compliance with regulations regular or unannounced external
              inspections analyse products and measure the quantities in stock to ensure that the plants comply with regulations performance techniques
              for applying bituminous mixes on worksites are regularly monitored in close conjunction with the relevant health and safety bodies
              quarries the sources of pollution identified include noise vibration and dust emissions external audits of quarries are made annually by
              approved organisations dust emissions are inspected in accordance with standards by an external body and a report is submitted annually
              to the regional departments for industry research and the environment drire

              because these risks are limited no special system has been set up to monitor the costs and investments associated with their prevention
              however all identified risks are analysed on a casebycase basis and provisions are made where necessary at 31 december 2012 provisions
              related to eurovia where the main risks in this area lie amounted to 226 million including 113 million in france corresponding provisions
              identified in vincis other subsidiaries stood at around 1 million

              as a general rule vincis companies are potentially exposed to the consequences of accidental pollution in particular spillage of hazardous
              materials on its roads network and construction sites this type of event which is fortunately rare can disrupt the particular site or operations
              and necessitate the deployment of crisis arrangements see section 121 paragraphs security and social political or economic context country
              risk and natural events


43           technological risks
              the groups companies have no facilities that present significant health or safety risks for neighbouring populations and the environment as
              defined under clause iv of article l5158 of the french environmental code seveso high threshold

              they can however be indirectly exposed to such risks in the following cases
              ˇˇ some of the groups activities may be carried out occasionally or permanently near facilities classified for environmental protection
              ˇˇ some activities carried out by vinci energies and vinci construction freyssinet vinci construction france soletanche bachy cfe vinci
              construction grands projets entrepose contracting etc take place inside classified facilities in particular nuclear power plants or nuclear
              waste treatment facilities those responsible for such facilities are subject to obligations and must take the necessary measures especially
              as regards evacuating people



5            insurance cover against risks
51           general policy
              vincis general insurance policy places a strong emphasis on prevention and risk protection given the groups decentralised organisation
              this policy is defined at several levels of responsibility

              vincis executive management lays down the general guidelines and in particular the standards applicable to all subsidiaries

              within this framework and after rigorously identifying and analysing the risks relating to their activities the managers of the business lines
              or major subsidiaries define the optimum tradeoff between the level and extent of the guarantees likely to meet the range of insurable risks
              and a cost comprising premiums and uninsured losses allowing business units to remain competitive with a view to preventing accidents
              and optimising costs uninsured losses are defined on an individual subsidiary basis

              selfinsurance budgets have been set up for civil liability motor vehicle insurance and damage insurance at eurovia vinci construction france
              and vinci energies

              in addition to subsidiaries specific cover vinci has also taken out cover on behalf of all its subsidiaries in particular regarding
              ˇˇ supplementary civil liability cover in addition to the first levels of cover arranged by subsidiaries
              ˇˇ civil liability protection for company officers
              ˇˇ liability for environmental damage


              vinci has its own brokerage firm vinci assurances in charge of consolidating insurance policies and harmonising cover within the group
              vinci assurances acts as a broker for most of the french subsidiaries and as an intermediary bears no financial risk as an insurer

126                                           report of the board of directors




52   loss prevention and claims record
      loss prevention arrangements are systematically adopted on construction sites and operating sites this policy which gives a major role to
      training forms part of vinci companies approach in the areas of quality assurance and prevention of workplace accidents

      the groups claims record in the area of civil liability is characterised on the basis of available statistics and data and without prejudging any
      actual responsibility by a low number of incidents involving more than 1 million by a few mediumsized incidents ranging from 100000
      to 1 million and by a relatively irreducible number of small incidents some several thousand of less than 100000 each which to a great
      extent are borne directly by subsidiaries as uninsured losses or under selfinsurance cover


53   insurance in the construction roads and energy business lines
      civil liability
      subsidiaries are exposed to their responsibility for bodily physical or immaterial damage caused to third parties including clients or employers

      the civil liability cover taken out by the group comprises a first line that combines the cover in place at subsidiary level intended to cover
      usual incidents and a set of complementary lines taken out for the common benefit by vinci

      in addition to this basic cover specific insurance is taken out as a result of legal or contractual requirements or management decisions par
      ticularly in areas such as
      ˇˇ 10year liability in france
      ˇˇ motor insurance


      property insurance
      contractors all risks car insurance is generally taken out in respect of major construction sites in particular this covers physical damage
      arising from accidents or natural events up to the value of the project as a maximum

      office buildings and fixed production facilities are covered for a contractual rebuilding value either value as new or an estimate of the maximum
      insurable loss site plant and equipment is covered on a casebycase basis and if financially worthwhile depending on value type and age

      road vehicles which are mostly pooled within fleets by subsidiary are not generally covered on a comprehensive basis


54   insurance in concessions and services business lines
      property insurance
      concession operation involves a potential exposure of the group to damage to assets under concession whether accidental or not that could
      result in an obligation to rebuild bearing the related costs as well as to financial consequences due to the interruption of operations and
      obligations to providers of finance relating to debt servicing as a general rule bridges tunnels and car parks are insured from their entry into
      service for their cost of reconstruction in the event of accidental destruction this is not however the case for motorways and rail lines where
      complete destruction is not envisaged

      civil liability
      assets operated under concession contracts by vinci subsidiaries in france or abroad are also covered by specific civil liability insurance
      arrangements which are coordinated with the complementary cover at group level to date no claim has been settled under these further
      lines of insurance in the concessions and services business lines these arrangements are specifically designed to meet local legal require
      ments and those laid down in concession agreements concession operations in which vinci is a minority shareholder do not generally benefit
      from the groups complementary civil liability cover taken out on behalf of all entities

      business interruption insurance
      business interruption insurance is intended to allow concession operators to restore an income stream interrupted or reduced by an accidental
      event affecting the normal operation of an asset thus enabling the operator to meet any financial commitments towards lenders and cover
      ordinary operating overheads during the reconstruction period

      for bridges tunnels and car parks losses from interruption to business are generally covered subject to various levels of uninsured loss losses
      may be expressed as an amount or as a number of days of interruption long motorways and rail lines which have little exposure to this risk
      are not systematically insured against such losses since a longterm or complete stoppage of operations is not taken into consideration
      uninsured amounts are determined on a casebycase basis to ensure that the concessions earnings are not materially affected by an accidental
      interruption in traffic

424           definitive granting of options at 9 july 2012 under the plan set up by the board of directors on 9 july 2010
                under the plan set up on 9 july 2010 the definitive granting of options is subject to the performance criteria determined by the shareholders
                general meeting namely that the board of directors will note at the end of a period of two years starting on 9 july 2010 any changes in the
                vinci share price and will determine the proportion of options to be definitively granted having regard to the shares performance compared
                with that of an index initially comprising 13 european companies from the construction and infrastructure concessions sector the board
                reserves the right to make any weightings reflecting in particular the market capitalisation of companies and to exclude from the list certain
                companies that during the reference period may have been the subject of exceptional transactions or delisting or that may have experienced
                atypical share price changes and to replace them if applicable with an index such as the euro stoxx index the number of options finally granted
                will depend on the percentage change in the performance of the vinci share against the index 100 of the options will be granted if this rate
                is higher than 5 and 0 if it is lower than 5 if the rate is between these two limits of 5 and 5 the proportion will be determined by
                linear interpolation
                at its meeting of 19 june 2012 the board of directors gave full powers to the chairman and chief executive officer to take note of any change
                in the performance index and thereby determine the proportion of options to be granted in accordance with the provisions of the plan
                on 9 july 2012 the chairman and chief executive officer noted that the vinci share had outperformed the index by 99 and therefore
                decided that all of the share subscription options that had been originally granted to the beneficiaries would be deemed to be definitively
                granted to them at this same date 4074560 options granted to 1661 beneficiaries it is to be understood that these options will only be
                definitively granted to their beneficiaries and may only be exercised by them from 9 july 2013 at the determined exercise price of 3670
                provided the beneficiaries meet the conditions to be considered as active employees laid down by the board in its meeting of 9 july 2010

              vincis business model is based on a complementary set of short and longterm business activities performed through a decentralised
              organisation vincis employees are vital to the success of its business model its operating methods therefore prioritise people over systems
              and are based on the view that sustained business success requires an ambitious approach to human resources

              as part of its forwardlooking management approach to jobs and skills since 2010 the group has applied employee development plans
              involving an annual appraisal for each group employee along with the requirement for entities to carry out a collegial workforce review and
              implement individual development plans covering areas such as job mobility and training

              as a major player in sectors that are highly fragmented and extremely competitive vinci works hard to set an example as a result vinci is

1223     reasons for departure

              the contracting business lines energy roads and construction execute their projects at temporary worksites and over a relatively short
              period they traditionally employ a large number of people whose contracts expire once the project is completed or who seek employment
              with another local company to avoid having to move in the concessions business and particularly in the motorways business line seasonal
              variations in activity also explain the relatively large proportion of expired contracts

              economic and social solidarity through job mobility and redeployment plans which are facilitated by the groups extensive presence similarly

        unions in the group and the right of employees to belong to a union achieving a constant balance between union involvement and close links
        with professional activities facilitating communication and meetings between trade union representatives and employee representative
        bodies ensuring that employee and trade union representatives are properly informed and trained by involving them in the groups major
        initiatives eg in the areas of health safety sustainable development gender equality and employing people with disabilities and working
        to foster communication and collective bargaining worldwide as laid down in the groups new manifesto dialogue between management
        and labour is of capital importance to the discussion of and implementation of its commitments

        employee representative bodies strengthen dialogue between management and labour by working locally with the various organisations that
        oversee occupational hygiene health safety and working conditions

        representative bodies france for example has a group works council comprising representatives from over 50 entities it meets at least
        twice a year and receives information about the groups business and financial situation employment trends and forecasts and health and
        safety actions at group and company levels it is kept informed of the economic and business outlook for the coming year and has access to
        the groups consolidated financial statements and the associated statutory auditors reports it is also informed prior to any decision of any
        significant projects that may affect the groups consolidation scope or its legal or financial structure and of their potential impact on employ
        ment in certain business lines bodies have also been established for each business activity vinci energies for example has created two
        extra employee representative bodies in order to ensure the continuity of dialogue between management and labour

        the european works council takes up discussions within these various local or national organisations at the european level the councils
        mandate renewed in 2010 under an agreement unanimously approved by all unions is composed of representatives from 17 countries in
        which vinci operates austria belgium the czech republic france germany greece hungary luxembourg the netherlands poland portugal

        employee representatives of the groups subsidiaries in the european economic area and switzerland are properly informed and consulted

153   trade union freedoms

        trade union freedoms since 89 of the groups business is in europe the european works council is the prime guarantor of freedom of
        association and the right to organise

183      measures to promote the employment and social integration of disabled people
           the groups strategy has two main strands the redeployment of staff no longer able to perform their current roles and the hiring of disabled
           people there is a further strand in france ie increasing the use of companies and nonprofit organisations that specifically employ people
           with disabilities

           in meeting vincis commitments the various business lines adopt strategies appropriate to their organisations the commitment of vinci
           subsidiaries to redeploy staff who become unable to perform their current roles resulted in the creation of trajeoh in 2008 trajeoh is a non
           profit entity that operates across numerous vinci companies its tasks are to keep these staff in employment and to support group companies
           with disability issues trajeoh was initially set up in the rhônealps region before moving into the greater paris region in 2010 to southeast
           france in 2011 and to normandy in 2012 the entity is financed by vincis local subsidiaries and is also supported by the groups business
           lines in 2012 trajeohs regional entities carried out 173 initial assessments and provided support to 142 vinci employees

214      preventing environmental incidents
           each group entity prepares and updates environmental incident prevention plans that address its specific environmental risks the most
           significant projects undergo a preliminary analysis of environmental risks which serves to determine the equipment and procedures required
           to prevent or mitigate any such risks specific documents and equipment are provided to help prepare for and respond to emergency situa
           tions at vinci construction france for example engineering and design departments construction managers and skilled site workers receive
           environmental risk prevention training tailored to the specific features of their activities the training covers both regulations and the sharing
           of best practices

           in 2012 vinci or its subcontractors were involved in six major environmental incidents eight in 2011 a major incident is defined as one that
           creates extensive pollution requiring cleanup by external specialists and has consequences stretching beyond the entitys responsibility
           three of the incidents resulted in water pollution two in soil pollution and one in the spillage of hazardous materials on a road in the united
           kingdom they were all handled in accordance with applicable regulations

215      environmental certification
           vinci encourages its companies to obtain iso 14001 or similar environmental certification to confirm and improve the effectiveness of their
           environmental management system companies in the contracting business lines continued their efforts in this area in 2012 change  includ
           ing in the integration of new companies and the development of new business activities for example  is analysed over several years significant
           progress was also made towards iso 14001 certification of operational activities particularly at vinci autoroutes which has had all its
           motorways certified as part of its ecomotorway programme and at vinci facilities as part of its green facilities offering

        fulfilled the information request the groups water strategy is based on its environmental policy to include water consumption and pollution
        prevention in risk analyses to measure and reduce water consumption resulting from its business activities and products and to protect water
        environments and ecosystems vinci has created an international hydraulic engineering activity pivot club to identify expertise and design
        new specific offerings

        group companies monitor water resources particularly carefully subsidiaries have adopted a number of specific initiatives to reduce water
        consumption programmes to repair leaking pipes are also being deployed on the entire vinci autoroutes network of all the vinci motorways
        in service 72 have been equipped with water protection systems involving either natural protection or structures that address potential
        problems the policy for protecting water resources was strengthened by the adoption of the green motorway package in 2010

        vinci plc monitors monthly water consumption on each project with the aim of reducing the volume used vinci construction has introduced
        a wastewater recycling policy in france some 60 concrete mixer washing stations have already been installed on worksites leading to large
        reductions in water consumption

        tools developed through the partnership with the chair in ecodesign enable the water footprint of specific neighbourhoods to be assessed
        in detail with particular emphasis given to soil permeability rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment some subsidiaries are creating
        specific processes for treating water pollution entrepose contracting has designed notil a net used to tow up to 10 tonnes of hydrocarbons

           vinci is gradually increasing the accuracy of its reporting on water consumption despite the diversity of its activities the increase in the
           concessions business water consumption is due to the expansion of the scope covered the 22 fall in water consumption at eurovia and the
           37 fall at vinci construction are due to the efforts made to decrease consumption the extent of these reductions is also due to the wide
           variety of the types of project carried out in the contracting business from one year to the next

           measuring water consumption remains very complex by way of an example earthworks activities use water mainly for hosing down work
           areas to reduce the amount of dust produced during works in africa water is often pumped from generators installed near villages simply to
           provide the communities with water the water itself undergoes no transformation whatsoever it either evaporates or runs back to the water
           table without being polluted water consumption is measured based on the fuel consumption of generators many businesses use water in
           this way responding to the cdp water disclosure questionnaire is thus a sign of the maturity of vinci companies

222      raw materials
           in the contracting business raw materials purchasing is decentralised with purchases monitored on a projectbyproject basis and not con
           solidated at group level efforts focus on purchasing recycled materials of equivalent performance recycling waste see paragraph 228 and
           sourcing local products there is also a focus on designing products that use fewer raw materials the groups ecodesign approach is used
           by vinci construction france for developing housing offices student accommodation and other projects in housing the habitat colonne
           procedure used to build about 500 homes in 2012 reduces raw materials consumption by 20

           in the concessions business consumption of the main raw materials is monitored and consolidated in 2012 1571018 tonnes of coating
           were used and 34902 tonnes þ of deicing salt were purchased 48386 tonnes þ in 2011

           the woodrelated businesses of vinci construction france under the brand arbonis generated revenue of 65 million in 2012 up 62 on
           2010

           in 2012 to gain a better understanding of the environmental impact of raw materials vinci collaborated with professional groups to prepare
           life cycle inventories lci of its materials the group also played an active role in discussions at the french governments environmental
           conference through the partnership with the chair in ecodesign postdoctoral research was used to apply european environmental data
           on the steel and wood used in construction to the construction practices in france based on the diogen database of civil engineering impact
           data as a member of the ecosd network that promotes expertise in ecodesign vinci has begun an initiative to compile a french environ
           mental database devoted to the construction sector vinci also participates in interindustry working groups such as the infrastructure
           committee of frances energy environment and transport observatory oeet and the gt41 working group of the french underground tunnel
           association aftes soletanche bachy is contributing to gt41 efforts to develop a life cycle assessmentbased methodology for assessing
           and comparing underground structure building methods estimating the impact of materials used making design and construction adjust

223      energy consumption
           in 2012 the group continued to focus on the actual performance of its activities and offers the measurement of energy consumption result
           ing from vincis activities worksite equipment vehicles infrastructure assets under concession etc was audited at group level by the
           statutory auditors who expressed a limited level of assurance in the figures

           in france the 2012 thermal regulations form a major part of the grenelle environment legislation and seek to encourage lowenergy buildings
           the regulations came into force in 2011 for some projects commercial buildings and housing in urban renewal areas to meet the new
           requirements while maintaining costs vinci is developing new systems in both the commercial and housing sectors drawing on vinci
           constructions expertise to minimise energy losses through the building shell and vinci energies to install innovative equipment such as all
           air heating vinci is playing a part in preparing the future 2020 thermal regulations which will consider the building sustainability as a whole
           and not merely in terms of energy current work is focused on building use and the calculation of overall multicriteria performance with its
           oxygen ecocommitment vinci construction france guarantees the energy performance of both the new and refurbished buildings it delivers
           and provides ways for occupants to optimise their energy use in 2012 18 oxygen projects were under development

           vinci facilities vinci energies is using its expertise in areas such as energy diagnostics and audits monitoring and optimisation work to
           develop diago energy efficiency contract solutions for its clients these may involve various levels of service from adjusting an energy supplier
           contract to performing major energyrelated renovation work in all cases clients are guaranteed a certain level of energy savings vinci
           facilities also uses its expertise to improve its own energy performance monitoring and managing its energy consumption and raising staff
           awareness about saving energy in 2012 energy performance was a major topic discussed in lectures given through the chair in ecodesign
           including during the seminar on 2 and 3 october on smart grids and energy performance guarantee for refurbished buildings

           in concessions atmospheric emissions were monitored at a sample of 272 vinci park vinci airports and vinci autoroutes car parks this
           revealed that most emissions are generated by users cars aircraft etc

227      noise pollution
           all vinci projects are subject to a preliminary noise study to limit the noise generated by urban construction sites motorway traffic and so
           forth soletanche freyssinet subsidiary soldata specialises in noise management in 2012 it deployed earis its software that analyses noise
           and vibration levels in real time and simulates them for construction projects and industrial activities vinci companies systematically offer
           technical solutions during the construction phase including changing a motorway route erecting noise barriers and embankments and using
           special lownoise road surfacing materials such as eurovias viaphone

           noise levels on motorways in france are measured regularly to enable vincis motorway concession companies to identify and reduce noise
           black spots homes may then be protected using noise insulation in their facades or noise barriers or embankments planted with shrubs or
           trees as part of the green motorway package vinci autoroutes has committed to providing noise protection to 1000 homes identified as
           noise black spots between 2010 and 2012 in 2012 662 homes þ were protected making a total of 1141 since 2010 studies and administra
           tive work were conducted in 2010 with most of the noiseprevention work carried out in 2011 and 2012

228      waste management and recycling
           vincis general policy is based on a circular economy model and focuses on three aims producing less waste at the source waste sorting and
           traceability and recovering waste to use as a resource this policy is closely associated with the ecodesign strategy used in vincis products
           and services waste management is important to both contracting entities  which deal mainly with construction site waste  and concessions
           entities which have to dispose of their customers waste car parks motorways etc

           the groups contracting companies implement waste management plans at their worksites in accordance with local requirements in the uk
           vinci companies have joined the national effort to halve the quantity of landfilled waste between 2005 and 2012 in 2012 vinci plc produced
           1251146 tonnes þ of waste of which over 98 þ was recycled reused or recovered a significant improvement on 2011 up 80þ vinci
           energies business units also monitor their waste closely including paper waste which totalled 1057 tonnes in 2011 in 2012 these business
           units produced 172078 tonnes of inert waste 13501 tonnes of nonhazardous waste and 672 tonnes of hazardous waste

           recycling has been a priority at eurovia for some 20 years and there is a veritable boom in the development of innovative products and pro
           cesses that use smaller amounts of natural resources and energy eurovia now has 130 facilities that recycle most of the waste produced by
           its worksites in 2012 eurovia set itself the target of exceeding 20 of recycled mix aggregate in its total amount of mix the percentage is
           being checked by the statutory auditors and has increased by 125 over 2011 making eurovia europes market leader in this field

23     combating climate change
        greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced in order to combat climate disruption in 2007 vinci initiated a proactive programme on this
        subject to anticipate monitor and comply with legislation in the most advanced countries the impact of current carbon emissions regulations
        on vincis activities is mainly indirect vinci has only one facility that is subject to the european emissions trading schemes national allocation
        plan see page 124 and must comply with the carbon reduction commitment in the united kingdom vinci autoroutes has undertaken a
        study of how carbon reduction measures affect its activities new regulations are opening up opportunities for vinci whose companies now
        offer their customers climatefriendly solutions that enable them to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions vinci committed to green
        growth in 2012 with a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 by 2020 this target covers the groups likeforlike co2 emissions
        and uses 2009 as its base year the first year when coverage exceeded 90 the group is also taking initiatives to reduce its clients energy
        consumption

231   greenhouse gas emissions
        the methodology used to determine the greenhouse gas emissions of vincis businesses is based on the groups environmental reporting
        data and measures iso 14064 scope 1 and 2 emissions scope 1 includes direct emissions from the use of fossil fuels fixed sites worksites
        and company vehicles as well as nonenergy emissions mainly from decarbonising limestone at eurovias lime plant scope 2 includes indirect
        emissions produced to make energy mainly electricity purchased and used at fixed sites and for projects overall vincis co2 emissions in
        2012 amounted to 24 million tonnes in 2012 32 vinci subsidiaries applied article 75 of the grenelle ii environment law which requires
        companies to perform greenhouse gas audits and define action plans to reduce them the groups emissions are determined using regulatory
        coefficients from the carbon database of ademe frances environment and energy management agency the coefficients were applied to
        data from previous years and recalculated for a pro forma comparison

              greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its business iso scope 1 2 and 3

              other levers for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are mainly to be found in how structures are used by clients and endusers operation

              vinci structures is part of an ecodesign approach that takes into account the construction operation and endoflife phases to compare
              and select the most appropriate technologies during the design phase the approach uses life cycle assessment lca tools which as well as
              co2 emissions measure indicators such as water consumption depletion of natural resources and impacts on human health these tools allow
              the group to ensure that co2 reductions do not result in other impacts at any point in the life cycle of its structures lca tools are developed
              within the framework of the chair in ecodesign and are used in numerous subsidiaries at vinci construction france and soletanche bachy
              ecodesign studies were carried out on 229 projects in 2012 eurovia also carries out lca on its new materials the co2ncerned methodol

              to optimise the carbon footprint of rail infrastructure

              vinci is an active member of national and international working groups within its industry association bilan carbone and encord that are
              defining standards for quantifying scope 3 emissions under this approach success depends on relationships with endcustomers which is
              why vinci autoroutes encourages motorists to drive less aggressively and to use the ecocomparison tool on its website to calculate the
              amount of co2 they could avoid emitting vinci construction shows building occupants how they can consume less energy through its oxygen

              between 2011 and 2012 the co2 emissions of vinci autoroutes companies rose 17 to around 37000 tonnes with the inclusion of the a86
              duplex in the environmental reporting scope emissions by motorway customers fell 23 due to a decrease in heavy vehicle traffic and the
              deployment of 30 kmh electronic toll lanes these nostop lanes have lowered co2 emissions by 41980 tonnes since 2011

              investors have responded positively to the measurement of greenhouse gas emissions and actions taken to reduce them in 2012 for the sixth
              year running vinci confirmed its leadership position in france regarding climate strategy by obtaining the carbon disclosure projects highest
              rating 80100 level c among its peers in the construction and public works category the carbon disclosure project which is conducted on
              behalf of 655 investors assesses how the worlds 500 largest companies by market capitalisation are responding to climate change


232         adapting to climate change
              vinci has adopted frances plan for adjusting to climate change and takes a forwardlooking approach to the issue the group plans in advance
              for any necessary changes to cities and buildings particularly in ecodesign projects in which studies span the structures whole life cycle
              similarly vinci companies have taken into account the scientific data predicting a 50 cm rise in sea levels by 2050 although they cannot take
              action regarding political strategy on receding coastlines they are developing expertise in technical improvements notably to strengthen
              barriers

              vinci plays a central role in making new and existing structures more resistant to extreme weather events ensuring longterm durability and
              providing innovative construction solutions it carries out extensive research both internally and through its partnership with the chair in the
              ecodesign of building complexes and infrastructure in response to the scarce funding available to public clients and the uncertainty about
              new financing partnership models vinci concessions supports the economics chair of publicprivate partnerships to develop knowledge in

241         vincis approach to biodiversity
              vinci strengthened its biodiversity strategy substantially in 2012 turning its biodiversity working group into a biodiversity task force the
              15strong team combines the groups ecology experts with the environment managers from its different activities and is primarily responsible
              for monitoring the regulatory environment developing scientific expertise analysing risks promoting initiatives and sharing best practices
              the unit also encourages organisations engineering and design departments and companies to discuss their approaches and tools these
              insightful exchanges are held under the banner of the working together programme

        the group drew on the expertise of the biodiversity task force in its response to the call for recognition from the ministry of ecology sustainable
        development and energy by joining the stratégie nationale pour la biodiversité snb national biodiversity strategy vincis proactive com
        mitment to promoting biodiversity was officially recognised in late 2012 the snbs recognition acts as a guarantee of the quality and consist
        ency of its 20122015 biodiversity programme which entails groupwide initiatives designed to
        ˇˇ pool and build knowledge on biodiversity
        ˇˇ share best practices
        ˇˇ train and raise the awareness of all staff members about biodiversity
        ˇˇ develop new solutions to better integrate biodiversity issues in all aspects of daytoday work


        eurovia also received snb recognition for its proactive commitment which includes a threeyear partnership with the natural heritage depart
        ment of mnhn frances national museum of natural history the mnhn will guide eurovia in the implementation and supervision of its
        snb project evaluation and monitoring of the general action plan assessment and audits of specific sites definition of biodiversity indicators
        training and awareness in exchange eurovia will provide its partner with sites for study in order to develop its knowledge on biodiversity
        inventory comparative analyses of changing environments monitoring of the performance of structures and ecological redevelopment etc

242   measures taken to promote biodiversity
        several group companies operating on long cycles and directly impacting natural environments  notably those involved in the concession
        construction of transport infrastructure motorways airports earthworks and quarries  have been looking at the issue of biodiversity for
        many years measures to avoid and reduce impacts on natural environments and to offset residual effects have been developed and applied
        in partnership with the stakeholders most affected depending on the project location species and ecosystem

        motorway concession operators are primarily concerned with the fragmentation of natural habitats essentially focusing their efforts on the
        transparency of infrastructure the reversibility of barriers and the restoration of ecological connectivity this includes creating environmental
        engineering structures reprofiling ponds making improvements to hydraulic structures restoring and enhancing sites of ecological interest
        redeveloping slopes sustainable roadside grass mowing and so on one of the emblematic accomplishments in 2012 was the construction
        of two bat bridges on the a89 worksite in partnership with the rhônealpes federation of organisations for the protection of nature frapna
        these structures allow bats to use echolocation to navigate over the motorway without the risk of collision other initiatives have been taken
        such as combating invasive species reducing the use of plant protection products and raising public awareness at rest areas

        along with the initiatives led by vinci autoroutes companies 120 measures have been taken in application of the biodiversity guidelines in
        the green motorway package once the points of conflict between natural ecological connectivity and motorway infrastructure had been
        identified the programme enabled a number of improvements to be made
        ˇˇ construction of environmentfriendly crossings for large animals underpasses for smaller wildlife escape areas for wild boar and ramps for
        deer and similar species
        ˇˇ biodiversity management plans implemented at sites of ecological interest near motorways
        ˇˇ creation of protective and communitybased orchards and olive groves etc


        the main issue faced by eurovia is restoring sites throughout the life cycle of its quarries notably in order to conserve and provide a favourable
        environment for new plant and animal species the company defines and monitors its measures with the help of local environmental organisa
        tions in france some eurovia sites have signed formal partnership agreements with these organisations and 72 of its quarries have joined
        the unicem environment charter

        in our construction activities and particularly during the earthworks phases protecting biodiversity at worksites is a highly relevant issue for
        example in 2012 special biodiversity signs were put up at 127 vinci construction terrassement worksites at the south europe atlantic
        highspeed rail line worksite 650 signs and 1750 pictograms are being installed emphasis is also placed on ecological engineering focusing
        on inhouse training and the sharing of best practices

        lastly conservation and improvement efforts are being made to protect and enhance natural assets along the entire south europe atlantic

              vincis social responsibility policy takes the form of various actions and programmes the groups impact on the areas where it operates its
              relations with stakeholders and sponsorship as regards sponsorship vincis companies focus on three main areas employment and social
              integration through work environment and research and culture and heritage assets in accordance with the groups decentralised manage
              ment model vinci does not consolidate either its reporting on sponsorship actions or the total budget allocated a lowrange estimate suggest
              a total amount of about 10 million in 2012

311         contribution to employment local skills development and professional integration
              employment and skills development
              vincis contracting activities the energy construction and roads business lines are highly labour intensive and thus have a substantial direct and
              indirect impact on regional employment see  12 employment the groups general policy is to use local resources whenever possible internationally
              and particularly in emerging economies vinci works to promote the development of local skills for both production and managerial staff

              in africa for example sogeasatom has undertaken a longterm commitment to the professional development of african managers enabling
              them to move into senior positions with this aim in view the company is supporting the development of local training structures and continues
              to strengthen its partnerships with the ecole polytechnique de dakar in senegal the institut supérieur de technologies dafrique centrale
              istac in cameroon and the institut international dingénierie de leau et de lenvironnement 2ie in burkina faso in 2012 sogeasatom
              confirmed the hiring of 11 recent graduates selected by the company as beneficiaries of special support measures throughout their studies
              it has lent similar assistance to a total of 19 students since the start of the 201213 academic year under this initiative some 50 young people

      launch of the project 94196 training hours have been delivered with local trainees accounting for 69 of session participants

      in france favouring local employment whenever possible and local skills development are key aspects of the groups policies for the south europe
      atlantic highspeed rail line between tours and bordeaux sea hsl the construction joint venture cosea has entered into a partnership with
      stakeholders in the poitou charentes region the french state regional authorities staterun job centres chambers of commerce and trade asso
      ciations a charter has been signed by all these parties formally recognising the projects commitment to local employment sustainable employability
      secure career paths and the reinforcement of local knowhow between the launch of the project and yearend 2012 close to 1000 people had
      been hired locally twothirds of whom were people excluded from the labour market ie among those targeted by professional integration meas
      ures the recruiters also focused on opening up these business activities to women who made up 10 of the machine operators trained in 2012
      to serve local hires nine training structures have been established along the route of the future rail line four specialising in civil engineering and
      five in earthworks with the aim of gaining a lasting foothold in the region which is necessary to ensure the longterm viability of this initiative

      professional integration
      since its creation vinci and its subsidiaries have worked to develop a number of initiatives to fight social exclusion and help the longterm
      unemployed and other disadvantaged people find jobs in 2012 xavier huillard chairman and ceo of vinci signed the pacte pour linsertion
      et lemploi launched by the comité national des entreprises dinsertion cnei thereby reaffirming the groups formal commitments in this
      area the aim of this initiative is to encourage all stakeholders to support the development of companies established specifically to promote
      social integration taking as its goals a threefold increase in the number of people served by social integration structures and bring populations
      back into the workforce over the long term

      the development of the vie social integration entity continued in 2012 launched in 2011 at the initiative of the groups executive management
      this new subsidiary provides innovative and effective solutions to group companies that want to address the workforcerelated demands
      stipulated in the social integration clauses of their contracts unprecedented in france this structure aims to support longterm social inte
      gration by providing assistance to group companies on a daytoday basis another role is to establish professional relations with socially
      responsible entities appointed by public authorities as their preferred contacts regarding social integration and advising local government
      authorities about new services that meet business needs in addition to serving group companies vie adopts a cohesive approach to getting
      socially excluded individuals squarely on the path to career development organised around social integration through work access to training
      and consideration of social issues faced by these populations all the while helping them find permanent jobs
      the vie structure is targeting controlled growth with a gradual rampup of facilities throughout france in 2012 vies offices in the paris region
      and northern france gained a firm footing while a new office was created in the southwestern part of the country for companies located
      outside these three regions vie offers its assistance on an ad hoc basis in 2012 the first full year of operation for the entity group companies
      enlisted vies services for the administration and coordination of social integration in relation to 87 projects corresponding to 1350000 hours
      of integration employment and involving more than 1200 subcontractors in all 710 people benefited from social integration measures in
      2012 including 12 women and 28 workers with disabilities corresponding to 343000 hours of integration employment

      vie also assists group companies with voluntary integration measures involving clauses added to supply contracts signed with service providers
      along these lines in 2012 escota became the first vinci company to include an integration clause in one of its ongoing maintenance contracts
      requiring at least 5 of labour hours for brushwood clearing and tree felling to be performed by longterm unemployed individuals

      vies integration coordinators participated in some 200 meetings with social and solidarity economy stakeholders and government officials
      in order to cooperate more effectively and improve the linkages between the various integration measures implemented throughout france

      relations with educational institutions
      vinci companies have consistently recruited new staff for a number of years even under challenging economic conditions and maintain
      longterm partnerships with educational institutions and in the education field the general policy is to enable all group companies to rely on
      vincis strong employer brand for their recruitment needs whether in terms of volume or quality a large number of partnerships are forged
      locally by group companies with apprenticeship centres schools universities and other institutions of higher learning they involve the alloca
      tion of the apprenticeship tax supplemented by the strong involvement of employees in educational initiatives apart from the usual short and
      mediumterm recruitment campaigns specific efforts targeting young people are also pursued well in advance of recruitment designed to
      introduce them to the groups professions and help them discover career opportunities

      in france vinci is an active partner of the capital filles programme bringing together six corporations and three government departments
      whose aim is to assist young women from lowincome backgrounds with their career plans in 2012 65 women employed by the group
      volunteered their time to visit secondary schools in disadvantaged urban areas across france to speak about technical occupations within
      vinci companies and mentor young female students the group also takes part in ma caméra chez les pros an introduction to vinci profes
      sions geared towards middle school students in addition vinci actively supports second chance schools in france serving educationally
      disadvantaged populations tending to be excluded from the labour market

      the initial fiveyear cycle of the first chair in ecodesign of building complexes and infrastructure sponsored by vinci in conjunction with
      three prestigious paristech institutions minesparistech agroparistech and the ecole des ponts paristech draws to a close at the end of 2013
      the partnership which has amounted to 600000 a year will be renewed with further research publications classes and seminars as well
      as practical realworld applications planned for the next cycle which will run from 2013 until 2017

      fabrique de la cité another recipient of vincis support is a think tank dealing with urban issues bringing together scientists people from
      the corporate world and publicsector decisionmakers it develops partnerships with schools and universities examples include the amur
      urban development and programme management masters degree offered by ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées enpc france and
      the masters degree in regional and urban development strategies offered by sciences poparis it also has a partnership with institut
      durbanisme de grenoble iug

   vinci 2012 annual report                              report of the board of directors                                                                  161




312      contribution to regional development and impact on local populations
           by designing financing building and operating bridges tunnels roads and other infrastructure over the long term all vinci companies are
           leading players in regional development whether in rural or urban areas as the groups activities cannot be relocated they give shape to the
           space where they are pursued endowing it with greater coherence and fostering both economic and social development through their strong
           local roots group companies generate significant economic benefits playing an important part in the life of surrounding communities as
           much through construction as through concession activities whether in the form of revenue local tax contributions or support for local non
           profits organisations and associations

           the groups cité solidaire programme for example in collaboration with group companies supports very small nonprofit organisations
           working on community projects in underprivileged neighbourhoods this programme invites proposals focusing on disadvantaged urban
           areas supports small neighbourhood associations that act locally and promotes commitments by group companies at local level to sponsor
           projects and offer communities the benefit of their employees expertise following two pilot projects in 2010 the effectiveness of this approach
           was confirmed in 2011 in three french cities in 2012 the programme was extended to four new cities in france grenoble le havre rennes
           and champigny sur marne

           the groups concession companies are gradually putting in place means of assessing the economic activity and social impacts generated by
           the operation of major engineering structures

           as an example of this type of initiative the group sponsored two studies analysing the socioeconomic impact of the rionantirion bridge in
           greece carried out by researchers at the university of patras the first study covered the investment and construction period 19972004 and
           the other covered the operation of this facility between 2004 and 2006 these two studies found that there was a 3 increase in the number
           of jobs an initial 25 increase in traffic followed by a 13 increase a 30 jump in property prices in the northern region during the first period
           and a 10 rise in the number of companies setting up operations in the region during the second period the second study also concluded
           that the bridge has had a positive impact on accessibility in the adjoining regions and has helped reduce economic disparities while also limit
           ing social exclusion in the areas to the north of the bridge and furthering the development of transeuropean transport
           in another example lisea the concession company for the future toursbordeaux highspeed rail line sea hsl established an economic
           think tank in september 2012 the role of this scientific body over the next 15 years is to measure analyse and publish reports on the impact
           of the future highspeed line on employment local economies and the development of regions along its route


32	relations with civil society stakeholders nonprofit organisations
     local residents users and consumers
321      conditions for dialogue with stakeholders
           by their very nature the activities of vinci companies interact with communities and their residents during both the construction and opera
           tion phases although public authorities are responsible for decisions on transport and energy infrastructure as well as facilities to improve
           the living environment including where they are to be located vinci companies increasingly serve as a liaison with local communities residents
           living in proximity to the structures they build nonprofit organisations and users in general the companies perceive consultation and dialogue
           with a projects stakeholders as a means to create value to provide a clear framework for this approach vinci is developing a specific meth
           odology and associated guidance tools the need for this type of framework has become apparent since although vincis contracting business
           requires consultation processes to guarantee the best result for all stakeholders during the works and project phases public survey safety of
           nearby residents and the wider local community worksite hours and schedules etc its concessions business involves these same processes
           over extended periods sometimes as long as several decades

           furthermore it is important to distinguish between countries that already have a consultation framework  whether the one in place is sat
           isfactory or in need of revision  from those that want to set one in place given this range of working environments vinci has adopted the
           simple reflex tool to fully involve partners in every aspect of a project including its management the tool has been tested using operational
           examples and is based in particular on vinci autoroutes experience the first phase of this methodology involves mapping project stakehold
           ers with three goals in mind identifying their actual felt and expressed needs with reference to solid material evidence building structured
           and measurable solutions to address these needs and directly involving stakeholders in project management

           for example in france the design and construction of the last section of the a89 motorway between balbigny and la tour de salvagny placed
           a priority on dialogue and consultation with stakeholders  including administrative authorities elected officials local residents farmers
           environmental protection hiking associations and angling and wildlife federations  throughout the entire project an environment committee
           was formed bringing together local environmental protection associations and engineers from asf vinci autoroutes which met regularly
           this experience sharing resulted in the drafting of an environmental charter including a complete set of measures more than 2000 employees
           ie the full complement of staff working on the project participated in sessions covering the importance of protecting the environment including
           practical guidelines offered by nature conservation associations as well as angling and wildlife federations

           the project for the future toursbordeaux sea hsl project in france is another example of vincis efforts in this area more than 100 public
           meetings were held in 2012 which allowed the expectations of the various stakeholders to be identified and taken into account in the form
           of design adjustments three working groups were established bringing together local nonprofit organisations and farmers residents
           chambers of commerce other trade associations and regional authorities through their participation in these working groups all stakeholders
           contributed to the development of the method for implementing the offset measures giving rise to a charter approved by everyone in 2012
           since it went live in november 2011 the projects website has logged more than 90000 unique visitors with an average of 1000 each day
           through this interface more than 1000 people have subscribed to liseas newsletter

           vinci airports is taking part in the hearings of the agricultural scientific and general public debate commissions set up at the end of 2012 by
           the french government to examine the future grand ouest airport project for western france the agricultural commission is tasked with
           identifying locally the means of minimising the projects impact on agricultural land and helping develop effective tools to combat rural space

        only 537 hectares will be developed to bring the airport into service of which 147 hectares will have artificial surfaces runways terminals
        tarmac etc over half of the land under concession will be conserved for use in its natural state and for agricultural purposes

        in canada djl eurovias quebecbased subsidiary has invested about 90000 to create a buffer zone around the mont saint bruno national
        park thus conserving biodiversity in an urban setting in order to recover the woodland balance in montreals greater metropolitan area

        in russia for the design and construction of the moscowst petersburg motorway vinci concessions has put in place an innovative tool to
        mediate conflicts with local residents relating to the environment following a period of heated discussions about the projects impact on
        khimki forest which had raised concerns among environmental nonprofit organisations vinci concessions enlisted the services of a medi
        ating body the nonprofit organisation pur projet which specialises in resolving issues relating to reforestation pur project engaged in dialogue
        with all stakeholders through a broad process of discussion and consultation with local residents environmental nonprofits administrative
        authorities and municipalities this mediation resulted in the joint development of a programme to conserve and improve the ecosystem of
        the forest in the path of the motorway these actions were then incorporated in the environmental and social action plan established by nwcc
        the consortium in charge of the project validated by the concession grantor and the russian authorities and financed by nwcc and its
        shareholders which include vinci concessions the first concrete actions on the ground have been launched in response to the concerns
        expressed by the local community and nonprofits educational programmes in schools studies to expand knowledge about areas of passage
        used by wild animals restoration of the sacred spring water source etc

322   actions and sponsorship to combat exclusion and reinforce relations with social integration organisations
        vinci encourages group companies and their employees to take part in the fight against social exclusion many companies are spearheading actions
        at local level in the regions where they operate most of these actions relate to the fight against social exclusion both on behalf of employees lacking
        job security and in support of communities where businesses are located vinci set up a corporate foundation in 2002 called the fondation vinci
        pour la cité which funds sustainable projects that promote ties across social groups and help people excluded from the labour market to find work

        national reach of assistance provided by its foundations in the context of an initiative launched in 2007 following the creation of structures
        similar to the fondation vinci in the czech republic 2008 germany 2010 and greece 2011 two new foundations were set up in 2012

        the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving set up in february 2011 aims to raise awareness among drivers about road safety
        promotes research on the risk of inattentiveness which is responsible for a large number of fatal motorway accidents and works to change
        driver behaviour through joint efforts with its partners and the various stakeholders including institutions professional bodies and nonprofit
        organisations this foundation gives vinci autoroutes a way of improving its understanding of the causes behind the accidents seen on todays

        has three thrusts first it backs initiatives by civil society organisations and supports innovative scientific research into certain areas of danger
        ous driving that have not been sufficiently explored or that are incorrectly identified by road users second it carries out public information
        campaigns with the aim of raising awareness of roadrelated risks and promoting responsible driving third it develops knowledge relating to
        the specific driving habits of different motorway user groups to help them take greater responsibility for their own safety on a daytoday basis

        in 2012 the budget allocated to the activities of the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving was 2 million the major study

324	relations and sponsorship actions in support of nonprofit organisations working to protect the environment
       and cultural heritage
           as part of its goal to drive performance over the long term in all its areas of activity vinci selects partnerships with nonprofit organisations
           working to protect nature as well as those active in the cultural realm environmental protection associations vary widely in their composition
           governance financing and expectations the groups actions are therefore carried out at local level and reflect where the companies are
           operating the specific characteristics of projects and the type of business being performed

           by way of example entrepose contracting vinci construction which is working on a pipeline construction project in papua new guinea
           has provided financial backing to the naturalist expedition programme la planète revisitée our planet revisited jointly organised by the
           natural history museum in paris and the nongovernmental organisation pronatura international in partnership with the institut de recherche
           pour le développement the aim of these expeditions is to fill gaps in knowledge of species worldwide for this third major expedition some
           200 researchers representing 21 different countries but also students and volunteers set out for papua new guinea considered as one of
           the worlds most significant biodiversity hotspots neglected species were treated as priority survey targets marine and land invertebrates
           plants fungi and algae the teams also measured the human impact on ecosystems and changes expected due to climate change

           eurovia adheres to the french governments national strategy to promote biodiversity to this end the business line has entered into a partner
           ship with the french natural history museum which will lend its scientific expertise and assist eurovia in its ongoing efforts to improve its
           biodiversity management as part of its activities lisea the concession company for the future toursbordeaux highspeed rail line has set
           up its biodiversity foundation with a budget of 5 million over the next five years involving the participation of representatives from frances

           companies have a duty to contribute to cultural production without neglecting the historical and regional context in which it is pursued
           across the group many companies are partners or sponsors of nonprofit organisations protecting built assets cultural institutions and events
           at local level vinci companies volunteer their assistance and technical expertise in connection with a large number of projects aimed at
           restoring cultural heritage treasures these companies are locally recognised for their voluntary actions and take part in heritage conservation
           efforts in line with longstanding traditions and predilections vinci is continuing its major cultural sponsorship actions by supporting local
           cultural initiatives across france notably in the cities of lyon nantes and nancy with the aim of continuing to preserve and raise the profile

           at group level as a leading sponsor of archaeological heritage studies vinci is an active member of the group of industry players involved in
           landuse planning brought together by the institut national de recherches archéologiques préventive inrap frances rescue archaeology
           institute and takes part in discussions to focus greater attention on and recognise the achievements of archaeological discoveries in the
           course of work on projects in 2011 vinci airports renewed the partnership initiated in 2004 in the form of a fiveyear agreement to continue
           its financing of a major archaeological dig at the site of siem reap airport in cambodia in close proximity to the famed angkor temple complex
           these digs are conducted by inrap in partnership with apsara the cambodian government agency for the protection and management of
           angkor and the siem ream region in this region archaeologists have tended to focus on the temples frequented by the elite in the heyday of
           the khmer empire but this project aims to shed light instead on the way of life of the artisans having built the temples in 2012 archaeological
           excavations near the airports runways yielded interesting discoveries about the regions inhabitants during the period they also provided an
           ideal opportunity to train cambodian archaeologists assisted by 85 vinci employees at the site vinci airports is also a longstanding partner
           and shareholder of artisans dangkor an organisation created to perpetuate and encourage the development of khmer traditional crafts while

325	partnerships and sponsorship actions to expand access to essential services and support social entrepreneurs
           around the world wherever they operate group companies support solidarity and development initiatives these actions are targeted tailored
           to address local challenges and thus vary depending on the region and its socioeconomic circumstances

           initiatives pursued by subsidiaries also relate to the nature of the work carried out in each region which may or may not involve their presence
           over the long term and may relate to largescale projects completed in short time frames or recurring work etc as initiatives differ widely
           this information is not consolidated at group level the examples below illustrate just a few of the actions conducted locally by subsidiaries

           in africa initiatives sogeasatom pour lafrique issa supports projects in two main fields  assistance provided to social entrepreneurs and

        manifesto commitment number 1 design and build together

331   general policy
        in 2012 purchases represented about 60 of the groups revenue remaining stable compared with the previous year and comprised of 943
        billion for materials and 1485 billion for external services including subcontracting and the cost of temporary staff during the year vinci
        reaffirmed its commitment to building balanced and sustainable relationships with its suppliers and subcontractors the group moved forward
        with efforts to measure and take into account workforcerelated social and environmental factors in the overall value chain
        these efforts are overseen by the purchasing coordination unit at group level a relatively small structure that was reinforced in 2012 with
        the arrival of new experts specialising in specific purchasing categories this unit works with the purchasing departments of business lines
        and subsidiaries and reports to a member of vincis executive committee this approach is implemented at local level by purchasing networks
        in particular through decentralised purchasing clubs in france and the various countries where vinci operates

        in september 2012 a national convention bringing together the members of all group purchasing networks was held in chantilly in the greater
        paris area to clarify vincis purchasing strategy in relation to three areas an optimised supplier selection process strategic partnerships and
        sustainable development this triennial event provided an opportunity to enhance internal communication share best practices and promote
        a proactive approach for the integration of workforcerelated environmental and social criteria
        a supplier charter explicitly describing overall performance commitments has been developed in order to communicate vincis expectations to its
        partners and reaffirm the need for compliance with the 10 principles of the uns global compact this document is currently being distributed to
        all group suppliers complementing its own internal procedures vinci has signed the charte des relations interentreprises developed by a special
        task force made up of french government representatives and members of the compagnie des dirigeants et acheteurs de france cdaf the french
        industrial buyers association as a further demonstration of its commitment to good conduct in clientsupplier relations some 305 french companies
        have signed this charter since it was launched by the cdaf in february 2010 with the aim of promoting fair practices and improving relations
        between major clients and smes within the group vinci constructions purchasing department has obtained iso 9001 certification

        in addition to the framework agreements signed by business lines and subsidiaries with their suppliers over 800 national european and global
        crossbusiness framework agreements were signed in 2012 to meet the multiple procurement requirements of group companies

        in 2012 the sustainable development and purchasing committee opened up several discussion groups this forum helps foster longterm
        balanced relationships with the groups suppliers and subcontractors and ensures that workforcerelated social and environmental issues
        are factored into the value chain its approach is to simplify and adjust internal communication to make it more operationally appropriate to
        define and implement tools and methods and to share and disseminate best practices

        a new training programme to raise buyers awareness of key sustainable development issues is currently under development designed to assist
        these staff members in their daytoday activities by providing the tools and responses necessary to promote more responsible practices

332   managing relations with suppliers
        in 2012 the groups purchasing policy led to an increasing emphasis on sustainable development criteria both when selecting products and
        suppliers and when drafting framework agreements and specifications for the group and its business lines these criteria take into account
        the environmental impact of products and services the workforcerelated arrangements for producing or providing them and the social
        commitments made by suppliers a review of feedback received clearly indicates that these efforts add value

        environmental performance in its purchasing agreements vinci increasingly favours products that are more environment friendly in 2012
        several tenders included questionnaires aimed specifically at differentiating suppliers in relation to these concerns

        for example in the vehicle category manufacturers and longterm rental companies emphasis was placed on emission levels the percentage
        of recycled materials and endoflife procedures the group has also adopted initiatives regarding zeroemission vehicles and infrastructure
        development vinci is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of its vehicle fleet group companies have tested electric vehicles under
        realworld conditions and vinci park is taking part in renaultnissans seine aval véhicules electriques save initiative to promote the use
        of electric vehicles over an 18month period this project will test the manufacturers electric vehicles in urban and suburban environments
        supported by a pilot network of 300 charging stations

        vinci autoroutes has implemented environmental clauses for all of its referenced suppliers as well as a shared assessment template used by
        asf cofiroute and escota first used at vinci construction for purchases of fitting and finishing services all group suppliers are now assessed
        on the basis of iso environmental criteria this approach has been extended to all purchasing categories with a view to continuous improve
        ment and enhanced coordination

        workforcerelated performance this strategy also involves paying greater attention to workforcerelated and social issues when selecting
        suppliers safety concerns are a priority across the entire group in 2012 meetings were arranged with all temporary employment agencies
        to monitor their progress in implementing recommended measures and to reinforce dialogue with the suppliers involved this referencing

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the board of directors                                                                 165




              procedure resulted in significant improvements in the area of safety measures observed by temporary workers in assessing the workforce
              related performance of purchasing this is the primary differentiating factor

              with regard to personal protective equipment emphasis was placed on working conditions throughout the supply chain vinci construction
              has introduced fines for failing to comply with safety clauses in addition a safety culture charter has been developed jointly by all stakehold
              ers including suppliers as well as joint contractors and subcontractors furthermore a national strategy has been put in place for the monitoring
              of purchases of finished goods involving the validation of selected suppliers by regional committees and the negotiation of groupwide
              framework contracts allowing for greater involvement of vincis commercial partners

              social responsibility performance across the group and through its various projects vinci develops partnershipbased approaches with its
              suppliers and favours relationships at local level with small and mediumsized enterprises smes the group increasingly prefers suppliers
              with strong roots in their regions in its selection and bidding processes its policy also involves expanding purchases from companies and
              nonprofit organisations that work towards social integration for the longterm unemployed and people with disabilities a number of new
              initiatives focusing on the development of partnerships with sheltered workshops were launched in 2012 by the groups business lines a
              banner year for this category of actions

              in france vinci has signed a national framework agreement with association des paralysés de france for the collection and recycling of waste
              electrical and electronic equipment and with ateliers sans frontières for the collection and refurbishment of discarded computer equipment
              for resale at preferential prices to other nonprofit organisations in 2012 nearly 545 tonnes of equipment were recycled revenue generated
              with sheltered workshops remained stable for the collection of weee

              in connection with the project for the construction of the new toursbordeaux highspeed rail line a special unit has been set up to manage
              the 450 million in strategic purchases affecting multiple group entities for the four business lines involved in the project the aim of the
              preparatory phase was to put in place a procurement logistics system that would be viable over the long term assist suppliers with workforce
              related and social requirements contribute to the social integration aspect of the project and ensure the participation of local economic actors
              volumes have been allocated in accordance with supplier capacities

              the groups civic engagement also takes the form of combating social exclusion and building bridges with people who suffer employment
              difficulties to further these actions a national consultation process was launched in summer 2012 to list temporary employment agencies
              in france that operate in the field of social integration through work with social integration clauses being increasingly included in contracts
              vinci wants to anticipate its clients requirements and is therefore taking a proactive approach and supporting organisations that it works
              with to help them expand

333         managing relations with subcontractors
              subcontractors are generally selected from among small and mediumsized enterprises located near group projects or worksites thereby
              contributing to local economic development these partners are increasingly involved in project planning and preparation workforcerelated
              and environmental clauses are gradually being added to their contracts the general policy is to strengthen relationships over the long term
              subcontractors and joint contractors have long demonstrated their commitment to the groups safety policy

              a best practices charter is nearing finalisation with a view to dissemination to all subcontractors and joint contractors in the first half of 2013
              the charter addresses the following topics compliance with regulations in force ethical behaviour improvement of health and safety criteria
              balanced business relations fairness and objectivity in relations with partners use of local enterprises governance and social responsibility

              vinci construction france has introduced specific clauses relating to environmental protection waste management and the impact of its
              projects visual aids have been developed to raise awareness among all personnel concerned these posters are available in french portuguese
              and arabic the three most common working languages at the entitys worksites in france as a further example vinci construction grands
              projets trains all of its subcontractors in waste management related risks and their potential impact through the alive on site programme
              some 2800 people have been trained in safety procedures emergency drills and the verification of qualifications are critical to the success
              of projects thanks to the use of the insight system the companys accident frequency rate has been reduced by a factor of three since 2010
              it monitors some 20 indicators to further improve practices at its worksites including greater awareness of the environmental regulations
              affecting vinci fourfifths of the revenue of vinci construction grands projets is derived from work with subcontractors

334         outlook
              in 2012 vincis purchasing coordination unit adopted sustainable development as a strategic priority over the next three years the unit aims
              to ensure the comprehensive integration of workforcerelated social and environmental criteria by all group companies coupled with the
              development of a coordination and monitoring tool incorporating key indicators to assess progress in this area the group is currently examin

341         prevention of corruption
              vincis code of ethics and conduct contains all the rules of conduct that apply to all group companies and employees in 2012 the group
              continued its efforts to disseminate and explain the code to managers who then made similar efforts within their own organisations the
              group actively monitors this procedure and an intranet tool enables executive management and the internal audit team to check that it is
              being deployed reports are submitted to the executive committee on a regular basis allowing remedial action to be taken quickly if required
              regular training sessions are organised to promote understanding of group principles and values at 31 december 2012 of the 6499 people
              identified as particularly exposed 95 had acknowledged receiving the code the aim is to reach 100

              the appointment of an ethics officer as part of vincis whistleblowing arrangements was widely communicated within the group any employee
              can contact the ethics officer in accordance with rules set out in the code which include a guarantee of confidentiality the commitment to

        the year in each case the issues were investigated thoroughly in compliance with the aforementioned principles in 2012 the ethics officer
        dealt with all queries received resulting in various types of measure

342   user health and safety
        road risks affect all vinci employees who drive any of the groups 30000 company vehicles or 10000 site machines as well as the 600 mil
        lion users of motorways roads car parks and other infrastructure operated by vinci worldwide under concession contracts campaigns are
        organised to raise awareness and training is provided for those employees most exposed to road risk one of the working groups created as
        part of the groups safe together initiative has been tasked with promoting the sharing of best practices in this field

        in october 2012 vinci autoroutes staged a truck village event on the a7 motorway for hgv drivers the event was an opportunity to discuss
        road safety with professional drivers and describe a new range of services to them medical screening information on risks related to drowsi
        ness and addictions small covered athletic fields and free charging stations for it devices

        as an example of its reinforced efforts in this area in 2011 vinci autoroutes set up a corporate foundation to promote responsible driving
        and raise awareness of the dangers of poor road safety the vinci autoroutes foundation for responsible driving see 323 in partnership
        with the nonprofit organisation 40 millions dautomobilistes the foundation distributed 100000 breathalysers at 12 service areas on french
        motorways in may 2012 over ascension weekend the purpose of this accident prevention campaign was to encourage drivers to test them
        selves in order to know their alcohol consumption limits and thus help keep roads and motorways safe


35     human rights
        vinci has been a signatory to the un global compact since 2003 it is thus committed to supporting and promoting respect for human rights
        within its sphere of influence and to ensuring that group companies are not complicit in human rights abuses in practical terms the group
        acts on this commitment by including clauses relating to human rights in its framework agreements with suppliers and subcontractors the
        external audit of qdvc vinci construction grands projets performed in 2011 by an independent consultancy vigeo group identified areas
        for improvement in relation to protecting and promoting human rights internationally and provided an opportunity to test advance the groups
        sustainable development selfassessment questionnaire

        as a result of these actions the groups procedures for the identification of human rights risks were refined in 2012 with respect to employees
        and subcontractors working on vinci sites as well as the groups suppliers the key human rights issues are preserving the wellbeing of group
        employees and all those who work on vinci sites protecting the fundamental rights of migrant workers the right to a decent salary avoidance
        of discrimination freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining and the prohibition of child labour and forced labour

        the fundamental rights of populations likely to be affected by the groups activities include in particular risks associated with the use of
        security services property rights in the event of expropriation and the rights of indigenous peoples

        the operational application of vincis human rights policy is carried out by its subsidiaries using advance the groups selfassessment tool
        to identify their risks precisely based on their activities and the countries where they operate the groups delegation for sustainable
        development and its purchasing coordination unit lend their expertise as necessary the latter disseminates framework agreements and has
        drafted a charter setting out the global performance commitments of vinci suppliers explicitly stating the groups policies with regard to
        human rights and working conditions

42           scope
              the reporting scope is intended to be representative of all vincis business activities
              ˇˇ social reporting has covered all group entities by worldwide revenue since 2002
              ˇˇ in 2012 environmental reporting covered 95 of group entities by worldwide revenue


              since 2011 the consolidation rules used for these scopes are the same as the financial consolidation rules except for the following entities
              which are still consolidated proportionally

43           indicator selection
              indicators are selected on the basis of the social and environmental impact of the groups activities and the risks associated with those
              activities

              there are three levels of core social indicators
              ˇˇ those specified in articles r225104 and r225105 of the french commercial code
              ˇˇ those included in the social report as required by french law and
              ˇˇ specific indicators reflecting vincis human resources policy


              the complementary nature of these three levels of indicators makes it possible to measure the results of the groups human resources policy
              and social commitments

              the core environmental indicators are made up of five types
              ˇˇ resource consumption energyco        and water
                                                      2
              ˇˇ waste management and recycling
              ˇˇ certifications and special projects
              ˇˇ environmental awareness and training
              ˇˇ environmental incidents and provisions for environmental risks


              each business line continues to use its own additional indicators which are based on its specific environmental challenges


44           methodological explanations and limitations
              the methodologies used for some social and environmental indicators may be subject to limitations due to
              ˇˇ differences between french and international definitions which vinci is working to harmonise
              ˇˇ differences in labour and social laws in some countries
              ˇˇ the fact that some estimates may not be representative or that some external data required for calculations may not be available particularly
              data required for environmental indicators at vinci construction where a statistical approach is being deployed for this purpose
              ˇˇ changes in indicator definitions that could affect their comparability
              ˇˇ changes in business scope from one year to the next
              ˇˇ the difficulty of collecting data from a subcontractor or joint venture with external partners
              ˇˇ the procedures for collecting and entering this information

              amounts and associated average prices for the 2012 environmental reporting reference period continued efforts are being made to report
              consumption levels directly

              due to the restructuring at the end of september 2012 that impacted some entities recently integrated into vinci energies france these
              entities did not report actual environmental data for the third quarter of 2012 but provided estimates based on the previous nine months

              have automatic sprinklertype fire extinguishing systems water consumption is calculated from the total purchase cost of water divided by
              its average price in france for other car parks water consumption corresponds to the volume of water purchased

              total energy consumption is expressed in mwh higher calorific value hcv the conversion factors used are 00104 mwhlitre 12027 mwh

      for vinci construction france consumption of water electricity and heating oil on worksites mobile sites is estimated using a statistical
      method coefficients reflecting the relationship between environmental indicators and revenues are calculated on the basis of a representative
      sample of worksites these coefficients were then used to extrapolate results to all worksites by applying them to consolidated revenue for
      the period from 1 october 2011 to 30 september 2012

      the figures in the annual report are based on data known at the end of the financial year they may however be adjusted the following year
      if a significant anomaly is observed and provided that the adjustment is substantiated in detail none of the figures published in the 2011
      annual report were adjusted in 2012

             toplevel representation visàvis third parties so as to clarify it and make the group more responsive the board believes that the groups
             solid performance over the last two years in a tough economic environment has confirmed the soundness of its decision

      outstanding level of information about the group and how it operates and also enjoys specific powers that are specified in the boards internal
      rules and restated in the report of the vicechairman and senior director on page 194 of this report these factors ensure the systems
      efficiency mr de silguy cannot be considered an independent director as defined by the afepmedef code because he held the position of
      chairman of the board between 2006 and 2010 nevertheless the board considers that his exceptional knowledge of the group by virtue of
      his previous position the information from which he will continue to benefit as specified in the internal rules and his availability constitute
      sufficient reason to assign the position to him mr de silguy reports on his activity to the remuneration committee in the form of a detailed
      written report

      is governed by a services agreement approved by shareholders at the shareholders general meeting of 6 may 2010 the board of directors
      is careful to ensure that this contract does not give rise to a conflict of interest or weaken the role of senior director that has been separately
      assigned to mr de silguy to this end his remuneration is a fixed nonadjustable sum and the agreements execution is reviewed every year

3    the board of directors

        the term of office of directors is four years the directors terms of office expire at different times such that approximately onequarter of
        the board is renewed every year

        the companys articles of association provide that no one may be appointed or reappointed as a director after reaching the age of 75 and
        that no more than onethird of the directors in office at the close of the financial year for which shareholders are asked to approve the financial
        statements may be over 70

        at its meeting of 5 february 2013 the board also made an assessment of the current directors independence as required by the afepmedef
        code and in accordance with the criteria of that code

        for the purpose of evaluating the independence of vincis directors the board decided to exclude the codes 12year seniority criterion for
        the reasons explained in paragraph a1 above

        although certain vinci board members may be customers or suppliers of companies having business relationships with the group the board
        has determined that given the business of the group and because business relationships between the companies in the group and their
        industrial partners are highly dispersed there is no significant flow of business requiring special surveillance and that might give rise to conflicts
        of interest concerning relationships with its partner banks the board examined the individual situation of the director who has had respon
        sibilities in the banking sector and concluded that no conflict of interest has been identified over the last five years and that he has full
        independence of judgement

        after receiving the report of the appointments and corporate governance committee the board examined the situation of each board member
        and reached the following conclusions

        directors who cannot be considered independent
        ˇˇ xavier huillard chairman and chief executive officer
        ˇˇ yvesthibault de silguy vicechairman and senior director this evaluation is based on the fact that mr de silguy was chairman of the board
        of directors from 2006 to 2010 and that he holds a services contract with the company the board has noted however that the execution and
        payment terms of this contract and the fact that mr de silguy is currently drawing a pension ensure that he has considerable independence
        of judgement
        ˇˇ elisabeth boyer director representing employee shareholders this evaluation was based on the fact that ms boyer is an employee of
        cofiroute a subsidiary of vinci the board nevertheless noted that ms boyer is a member of an employee representative body giving her
        protection that could enable her to be considered an independent director under the european commission recommendation 2005162
        ec of 5 february 2005
        ˇˇ jeanpierre lamoure this evaluation was based on the fact that mr lamoure was an employee of soletanche freyssinet a wholly owned
        subsidiary of vinci the board of directors has noted however that mr lamoure no longer performs any operational functions within the
        vinci group

        directors who can be considered independent
        the board of directors believes that the following members of the board are independent it believes that even if some of them do not meet
        certain criteria set out by the afepmedef code the judgement of these individuals is completely independent ensuring that they can carry
        out their remit in a fully independent manner
        ˇˇ robert castaigne the board has taken into account the fact that until may 2008 mr castaigne was chief financial officer and member of
        the executive committee of the total group with which the vinci group has normal business relationships involving fuel purchase contracts
        or construction projects for example the board believes that these factors do not alter mr castaignes independence of judgement
        ˇˇ françois david mr david is chairman of coface the board believes however that the normal commercial relationships that might exist
        between the coface group and the vinci group eg insurance policies for contracts entered into by vinci subsidiaries abroad do not alter
        mr davids independence of judgement
        ˇˇ patrick faure the board noted that mr faure has been a director of vinci since 1993 ie more than 12 years and that he sits on the board
        of cofiroute a company controlled by vinci the board believes however that mr faures directorship at cofiroute does not alter his inde
        pendence of judgement on the contrary the board believes this constitutes an advantage inasmuch as mr faure has useful experience in
        motorway concessions from which the other members of the board can benefit
        ˇˇ dominique ferrero the board considers that mr ferrero no longer has an operational role within the natixis group the board took into
        consideration mr ferreros statements according to which his functions did not give rise to any conflict of interest in 2012
        ˇˇ jeanbernard lévy the board considers that the normal business relationships that exist between the thales group of which mr lévy
        became the chairman and ceo on 20 december 2012 and certain vinci group companies do not alter mr lévys independence of judgement
        ˇˇ michael pragnell held management responsibilities within syngenta ag until 2007 this company has no business relationship with the
        vinci group
        ˇˇ henri saint olive mr saint olive is chairman of banque saint olive which might enter into transactions with the company or its subsidiaries
        or into private transactions with executives thereof the board believes however that such transactions do not alter mr saint olives independ
        ence of judgement
        ˇˇ pascale sourisse ms sourisse has management responsibilities within the thales group the board believes however that the normal
        business relationships that may exist between the thales group and certain companies in the vinci group do not alter ms sourisses inde
        pendence of judgement
        ˇˇ qatari diar real estate investment company the board noted that the qatari diar group held less than 6 of the share capital and voting
        rights of vinci acquired when the cegelec group was sold to vinci in addition the board noted that vinci construction grands projets a
        wholly owned subsidiary of vinci and qatari diar are partners in the qatarilaw company qatari diar vinci construction qdvc this company
        51owned by qatari diar is involved in developing construction activities in qatar and elsewhere in the middle east abdul hamid janahi
        has been the permanent representative of qatari diar on the board of vinci since 29 november 2012 the board believes however that the
        information presented above does not affect mr hamid janahis independence of judgement as a member of the board of vinci

182                                             report of the chairman




        as a result of this evaluation the board of directors considers that nine of its 13 members ie more than half qualify as independent

        the board has also examined the situations of ms yannick assouad and ms graziella gavezotti whose appointments to the board will be
        proposed to shareholders at their general meeting on 16 april 2013 and considers that they meet all the criteria qualifying them as
        independent

        in view of the expiry of the terms of mr david and mr faure and if the two aforementioned candidates are appointed as directors by the
        shareholders general meeting nine directors out of 13 can be considered at that point as independent


32     personal situation of company officers

        ˇˇ there are no family links between any of vincis company officers

b    internal control and risk management procedures
1    introduction
11   definitions and reference framework
      in july 2010 the french stock market regulator the autorité des marchés financiers amf published the findings of the working group formed
      under its aegis this document is entitled risk management and internal control systems reference framework
      the vinci group uses this document as its reference framework

      the risk management and internal control systems participate in a complementary manner in keeping control over the groups business
      risk is the possibility that an event might take place with consequences that would adversely affect the objectives of the group and in
      particular those related to its financial condition and reputation

      the risk management system aims to identify and analyse the principal risks that the groups subsidiaries encounter internal control
      encompasses all the controls to best handle these risks
      risk management is therefore a set of resources conduct procedures and initiatives that correspond to the characteristics of the vinci
      groups businesses and maintain risk at an acceptable level
      vincis risk management system is a management tool to be used by each company in the group to help
      ˇˇ create and preserve value assets and the companys reputation
      ˇˇ secure the companys decisionmaking procedures and other processes so as to increase the likelihood of achieving objectives
      ˇˇ ensure that initiatives are in line with the companys values
      ˇˇ foster a shared view of the principal risks among employees of the company


      the internal control system aims more particularly to ensure
      ˇˇ that the instructions and guidelines set by the executive management are implemented
      ˇˇ that laws and regulations are complied with
      ˇˇ that the internal processes function correctly notably those contributing to the safeguarding of its assets
      ˇˇ that financial reporting is reliable


      the internal control system is a set of resources procedures conduct and initiatives that correspond to the characteristics of the vinci groups
      businesses and which
      ˇˇ helps the businesses run smoothly and contributes to effective operations and efficient use of resources
      ˇˇ must enable significant risks to be taken into account in an appropriate manner whether they are operational financial or legal


      nevertheless like any set of controls however well designed and implemented the internal control system may be it cannot provide an
      absolute guarantee that the group will achieve its objectives


12   scope of risk management and internal control
      in addition to managing a system specific to vinci holding the group also ensures that there are risk management and internal control
      systems in place at each of its component businesses these systems apply to fully consolidated entities a list of which can be found in
      chapter j of the notes to the consolidated financial statements page 268

      for the specific case of the listed belgian company cfe in which vinci has a 4684 capital stake and its subsidiaries the provisions in force
      are adapted to the specific features of belgian law which attributes responsibility for risk management and internal control to the board of
      directors of companies listed on the stock exchange


2    environment and organisation
21   principles of action and conduct
      the businesses in which vinci operates require the personnel involved to be geographically close to customers in order to ensure the prompt
      delivery of solutions that are suited to their needs to enable the manager of each business unit  around 3500 in total in the group  to take
      the required operational decisions rapidly a decentralised organisation has been implemented in each business concessions and contracting
      business line and division as well as in vinci immobilier
      consequently the group has implemented appropriate delegation of authority and responsibility to operational and functional staff at all
      levels the delegation of authority to these staff is carried out in compliance with the general guidelines see paragraph 42 and the principles
      of action and conduct to which vinci is strongly committed
      ˇˇ strict compliance with the rules common to the whole group in respect of commitments risktaking see paragraph 43 acceptance of
      contracts see paragraphs 44 and 45 and reporting of financial accounting and management information see paragraph 42 these com
      mon rules which are deliberately restricted in number given the broad spectrum of the groups activities must be strictly applied by the
      staff concerned and their teams
      ˇˇ transparency and loyalty of managers towards their line management superiors and towards the functional departments of the business
      lines and the holding company in particular managers are required to inform their superiors of any significant difficulties encountered in the
      performance of their duties eg with respect to carrying out work on sites relations with customers government departments suppliers and
      financial partners internal relations personnel management safety etc an integral part of operational managers duties is to take decisions
      alone on matters falling within their area of competence within the framework of the general guidelines they have received and accepted

      vinci 2012 annual report                               report of the chairman                                                                            189




              nevertheless any significant difficulties encountered must be handled with the assistance as necessary of their line management superiors
              or the functional departments of the business lines and the vinci holding company
              ˇˇ compliance with the laws and regulations in force in the countries where the group operates
              ˇˇ adherence to the code of ethics and conduct
              ˇˇ responsibility of operational executive managers to communicate the groups principles governing action and conduct to their staff by
              appropriate means and to set a good example this responsibility cannot be delegated
              ˇˇ health and safety of individuals employees external service providers subcontractors etc
              ˇˇ a culture of financial performance

              ments operational financial or in relation to compliance with laws and regulations

              the group applies the policies set by the executive committee these policies aim to comply with the legal requirements and to ensure that
              risks are monitored in a more formalised systematic and uniform manner this plan involves operational managers but without complicating
              operating methods risk monitoring is an integral part of the existing procedures related to commitments and periodic monitoring of
              operations

              a riskmapping process encompassing all the groups activities was created in 2009 and is updated periodically as follows in accordance
              with the amfs recommendations
              ˇˇ anticipation of the main identifiable risks either internal or external that represent obstacles to the achievement of the companys objectives

5	actions undertaken to strengthen risk management and internal control
51   tasks carried out prior to 2012
      in 2003 vinci initiated an action plan intended to enhance the quality of the groups risk management and internal control systems without
      calling into question the principles and features of its decentralised management organisation these actions included in particular

      assessment of internal control
      annual selfassessment surveys to measure the quality of internal control in accordance with the requirements of the french financial security
      act covered an everincreasing number of group entities rising from 193 in 2005 to 370 in 2011

      information systems
      surveys to assess the operation of information systems were carried out in 2006 2008 13 entities in metropolitan france building a repre
      sentative sample and 2009 33 subsidiaries based outside metropolitan france

      in 2011 a working group assisted by an external consultancy prepared a report on the adequacy of the information systems used by vincis
      different business lines with respect to the groups objectives the report is based on the results of a survey of vincis component entities

      the code of ethics and conduct previously disseminated via the corporate hierarchy was made available to all employees on the group intranet
      on 1 february 2011

      in 2011 in line with its objectives vinci implemented its fast close procedure aimed at closing and publishing its financial statements at
      the beginning of february representing a onemonth gain on its previous publication schedule


52   tasks carried out in 2012
      the annual selfassessment survey of internal control quality in the vinci group was carried out on 472 legal entities in 2012 including 110
      outside france representing 84 of the groups consolidated business the questionnaire contained 58 questions apart from the recurrent
      topics related to the internal control system and to financial and accounting information the annual topic in 2012 related to purchasing and
      subcontracting the survey was conducted using specialised software that also enables entities to manage their action plans the report
      prepared by the holding companys audit department was presented to vincis executive committee and then to the audit committee in
      december as in 2011 a specific questionnaire was sent to the chairman and chief executive officer covering matters related to his
      functions
      with regard to information systems vincis executive committee considered that a more effective flow of communication within the group
      was essential to achieving current and future objectives and therefore initiated developments that were carried out in 2012 in the following
      areas
      ˇˇ interoperability of group networks
      ˇˇ redesign of vincis intranet and launch of version 20 based on a collaborative approach


      the fast close procedure was applied to the halfyear financial statements published at the end of july

      each group component prepared a report summarising the specific actions carried out in 2012 the reports which in particular give an account
      of the audits and reviews carried out did not reveal any significant problems
      in addition vincis audit department carried out audits in each of the following business lines vinci concessions eurovia vinci energies
      and vinci construction
      these audits did not reveal any problems that might have a significant impact on the business or financial statements of the group


53   work to be done in 2013 and beyond
      vinci aims to continue improving the organisation of internal control within the group while maintaining a streamlined chain of command
      both at the holding company and business line levels
      in addition to the annual internal control selfassessment survey a selfassessment campaign on information systems was started in early
      2013

      the interoperability programme for messaging networks launched in 2012 is also under way

      the accounting policies used at 31 december 2012 are the same as those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements at
      31 december 2011 except for the standards and interpretations adopted by the european union applicable as from 1 january 2012 see
      note a11 new standards and interpretations applicable from 1 january 2012

      the amended version of ias 19 employee benefits must be applied to accounting periods starting on or after 1 january 2013 it features
      several changes in the way that postemployment benefits are recognised including the following
      ˇˇ all postemployment benefits granted to group employees must be recognised in the consolidated balance sheet the corridor method
      and the ability to amortise past service cost against income over the average vesting period will no longer be possible see note a3271
      provisions for retirement benefit obligations
      ˇˇ calculating the expected return on pension plan assets will now involve the discount rate used for calculating obligations with respect to
      defined benefit plans
      ˇˇ the impacts of plan amendments must be recognised in income
      ˇˇ impacts of remeasurements must be recognised in other comprehensive income actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obliga
      tions plan asset outperformanceunderperformance ie the difference between the effective return on plan assets and the return calculated
      using the discount rate applied to the actuarial liability and changes in the asset ceiling effect

      the new arrangements resulting from the revised version of ias 19 will be applied retrospectively by the group the main impacts on the
      groups consolidated balance sheets at 1 january 2012 and 31 december 2012 are estimated as follows and correspond to the recognition
      of actuarial gains and losses and past service costs that were previously not recognised

              companies in which the group holds whether directly or indirectly the majority of voting rights enabling control to be exercised are fully
              consolidated companies that are less than 50 owned but in which vinci exercises de facto control  ie has the power to govern the financial
              and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities  are consolidated using this same method this relates mainly
              to cfe a belgian construction group quoted on the brussels stock market of which vinci owns 4684 and over which it has de facto control
              in view in particular of the widely held nature of that companys shareholder register

              jointly controlled operations and assets are recognised on the basis of the groups share of the assets liabilities income and expenses this
              relates mainly to construction operations carried out in partnership in the form of consortia or joint ventures in the contracting business and
              at vinci immobilier

              companies over which the group exercises significant influence and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method

              when determining its level of control over an entity vinci also analyses any instruments held by the group or by third parties which if exer
              cised could cause the group to obtain or lose control of the entity concerned

              vincis consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of all companies with revenue of more than 2 million and of
              companies whose revenue is below this figure but whose impact on the groups financial statements is material

              the main changes in the period relate to the acquisition of the carmacks group in alberta canada six companies and napc in india one
              company by eurovia in the first half of 2012 and of ga gruppe in germany 14 companies plus a newly created holding company by

              gefyra which holds the concession for the rionantirion bridge in greece and was fully consolidated until 1 october 2012 has since that
              date been accounted for under the equity method after a change in the groups ability to exert sole control over the company
              the increase in the number of consolidated companies is mainly the result of changes to vinci energies operational organisation during the
              year this led to the creation of 41 companies and the combination of eight others within vinci energies france other acquisitions during the
              period mainly concerned vinci concessions four companies vinci energies 17 companies vinci construction 11 companies and eurovia

              the financial statements of foreign companies of which the functional currency is different from that used in preparing the groups consoli
              dated financial statements are translated at the closing rate for balance sheet items and at the average rate for the period for income statement
              items any resulting translation differences are recognised under translation differences in consolidated reserves goodwill relating to foreign
              entities is considered as comprising part of the assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore translated at the exchange rate in force at the

      business combinations completed between 1 january 2004 and 31 december 2009 were recognised applying the provisions of the previous
      version of ifrs 3
      business combinations completed from 1 january 2010 onwards have been recognised in accordance with ifrs 3 revised this standard has
      been applied prospectively it has therefore not affected business combinations made before 1 january 2010
      in application of this revised standard the group recognises the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value at the dates when
      control was acquired the cost of a business combination is the fair value at the date of exchange of the assets given liabilities assumed and
      or equity instruments issued by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree contingent price adjustments are measured at fair value
      at each balance sheet date after 12 months have elapsed from the acquisition date any subsequent changes to this fair value are recognised
      in profit or loss
      expenses that are directly attributable to the acquisition such as professional fees for due diligence and other related fees are expensed as
      they are incurred
      noncontrolling interests in the acquiree are measured either at their share of the acquirees net identifiable assets or at their fair value this
      option is applied on a casebycase basis for each acquisition
      the cost of acquisition is allocated by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at their fair value at that date except
      for assets or asset groups classified as held for sale under ifrs 5 which are recognised at their fair value less costs to sell the positive differ
      ence between the cost of acquisition and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired constitute goodwill where applicable
      the cost of acquisition can include the fair value of noncontrolling interests if the full goodwill method has been selected
      the group has 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the accounting for business combinations
      in the case of a business combination achieved in stages previously acquired shareholdings in the acquiree are measured at fair value at the
      date of acquisition of control any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss



26   transactions between shareholders acquisitions and disposals of noncontrolling
      interests after acquisition of control
      in accordance with ias 27 revised acquisitions or disposals of noncontrolling interests with no impact on control are considered as transac
      tions with the groups shareholders under this approach the difference between the consideration paid to increase the percentage share
      holding in an alreadycontrolled entity and the supplementary share of equity thus acquired is recorded under consolidated equity similarly
      a decrease in the groups percentage interest in an entity that continues to be controlled is booked in the accounts as a transaction between
      shareholders with no impact on profit or loss



27   discontinued operations halted or sold operations and assets classified as held for sale
      discontinued operations
      whenever discontinued operations halted or sold or operations classified as held for sale are
      ˇˇ a business line or a geographical area of business that is material for the group and that forms part of a single disposal plan or
      ˇˇ a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale
      they are shown on a separate line of the consolidated income statement at the balance sheet date
      assets connected with discontinued operations if held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their estimated selling
      price less costs to sell income statement and cash flow items relating to these discontinued operations are shown on a separate line for all
      the periods presented

      assets classified as held for sale
      noncurrent assets of which the sale has been decided during the period are shown on a separate line of the balance sheet whenever the sale
      is expected to be completed within 12 months such assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their estimated selling
      price less costs to sell
      contrary to discontinued operations income statement and cash flow items relating to assets classified as held for sale are not shown on a
      separate line



3    measurement rules and methods
31   use of estimates
      the preparation of financial statements under ifrss requires estimates to be used and assumptions to be made that affect the amounts shown
      in those financial statements
      these estimates assume the operation is a going concern and are made on the basis of the information available at the time estimates may
      be revised if the circumstances on which they were based alter or if new information becomes available actual results may be different from
      these estimates

      the consequence of the economic and financial crisis in europe in particular financial market volatility access to finance and economic growth
      makes it difficult to assess the outlook for business in the medium term the consolidated financial statements for the period have therefore
      been prepared with reference to the immediate environment in particular as regards the estimates given below

      vinci 2012 annual report                              consolidated financial statements                                                               205




311         measurement of construction contract profit or loss using the stage of completion method
              the group uses the stage of completion method to recognise revenue and profit or loss on construction contracts applying the general
              revenue recognition rules on the basis of the stage of completion
              the stage of completion and the revenue to recognise are determined on the basis of a large number of estimates based on monitoring of the
              work performed and using the benefit of experience to take account of unforeseen circumstances in consequence adjustments may be made
              to initial estimates throughout the contract and may materially affect future results

312         values used in impairment tests
              the assumptions and estimates made to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill intangible assets and property plant and equipment
              relate in particular to the assessment of market prospects needed to estimate the cash flows and the discount rates adopted any change in
              these assumptions could have a material effect on the recoverable amount the main assumptions used by the group are described in note e13
              impairment tests on goodwill and other nonfinancial assets

313         measurement of sharebased payment expenses under ifrs 2
              the group recognises a sharebased payment expense relating to the granting to its employees of share options offers to subscribe to or
              purchase shares performance share plans and shares under the group savings plans this expense is measured on the basis of actuarial
              calculations using estimated behavioural assumptions based on observation of past behaviour
              the main actuarial assumptions expected volatility expected return on the share etc adopted by the group are described for each plan in
              note e19 sharebased payments

314         measurement of retirement benefit obligations
              the group is involved in defined contribution and defined benefit retirement plans its obligations in connection with these defined benefit
              plans are measured actuarially based on assumptions such as the discount rate the return on the investments dedicated to these plans future
              increases in wages and salaries employee turnover mortality rates and the rate of increase of health expenses
              most of these assumptions are updated annually details of the assumptions used and how they are determined are given in note e201
              provisions for retirement benefit obligations the group considers that the actuarial assumptions used are appropriate and justified in the
              current conditions obligations may however change if assumptions change

315         measurement of provisions
              the factors that materially influence the amount of provisions relate to
              ˇˇ the estimates made on a statistical basis from expenses incurred in previous years for aftersalesservice provisions
              ˇˇ the forecasts of expenditures on major maintenance over several years used as a basis for the provisions for obligations to maintain the
              condition of infrastructure under concession these forecasts are estimated taking account of indexation clauses included in construction
              and civil engineering contracts mainly the tp01 tp02 and tp09 indices
              ˇˇ the estimates of forecast profit or loss on construction contracts which serve as a basis for the determination of losses on completion see
              note a34 construction contracts
              ˇˇ the discount rates used to determine the present value of these provisions


316         measurement of financial instruments at fair value
              fair value is determined on the basis of the following three models or levels
              ˇˇ level 1  quoted prices on an active market whenever quoted prices on an active market are available these are used in priority to determine
              fair value marketable securities and some listed bond issues are measured in this way
              ˇˇ level 2  internal model using internal measurement techniques with observable factors these techniques are based on usual mathemati
              cal computation methods which incorporate observable market data forward prices yield curves etc the calculation of the fair value of
              most derivative financial instruments swaps caps floors etc traded on markets is made on the basis of models commonly used by market
              participants to price such financial instruments
              every quarter the internally calculated values of derivative instruments are checked for consistency with the values sent to vinci by the
              counterparties
              ˇˇ level 3  internal model using nonobservable factors this model applies in vinci only for holdings of unlisted shares which in the absence
              of an active market are measured at their cost of acquisition plus transaction costs


32           revenue
              consolidated revenue of the contracting business vinci energies eurovia and vinci construction is recognised in accordance with ias 11
              construction contracts it includes the total of the work goods and services generated by the consolidated subsidiaries pursuing their main
              activity and the revenue for construction work on infrastructure under concession the method for recognising revenue under construction
              contracts is explained in note a34 construction contracts below
              consolidated revenue of the concessions business is recognised in accordance with ias 18 revenue and ias 11 the method for recognising
              revenue in respect of concession contracts is explained in note a35 concession contracts below it comprises
              ˇˇ tolls for the use of motorway infrastructure operated under concession revenue booked by car parks and airport service concessions and
              ancillary income such as fees for the use of commercial installations rental of telecommunications infrastructure and advertising space and
              ˇˇ revenue in respect of the construction of new concession infrastructure recognised on a stage of completion basis in accordance with ias 11
              in the property sector revenue arising on lots sold is recognised as the property development proceeds in accordance with ifric 15
              agreements for the construction of real estate

206                                              consolidated financial statements




33     revenue from ancillary activities
        revenue from ancillary activities mainly comprises rental income sales of equipment materials and merchandise study work and fees other
        than those generated by concession operators


34     construction contracts
        the group recognises construction contract income and expenses using the stage of completion method defined by ias 11 for the
        vinci construction business line the stage of completion is usually determined on a physical basis for the other business lines eurovia and
        vinci energies it is determined on the basis of the percentage of total costs incurred to date
        if the estimate of the final outcome of a contract indicates a loss a provision is made for the loss on completion regardless of the stage of
        completion based on the best estimates of income including if need be any rights to additional revenue or claims if these are probable and
        can be reliably estimated provisions for losses on completion are shown under liabilities
        part payments received under construction contracts before the corresponding work has been carried out are recognised under liabilities
        under advances and payments on account received


35     concession contracts
        under the terms of ifric 12 service concession arrangements a concession operator has a twofold activity
        ˇˇ a construction activity in respect of its obligations to design build and finance a new asset that it makes available to the grantor revenue
        is recognised on a stage of completion basis in accordance with ias 11
        ˇˇ an operating and maintenance activity in respect of concession assets revenue is recognised in accordance with ias 18


        in return for its activities the operator receives remuneration from either
        ˇˇ users the intangible asset model applies the operator has a right to receive tolls or other payments from users in consideration for the
        financing and construction of the infrastructure the intangible asset model also applies whenever the concession grantor remunerates the
        concession operator based on the extent of use of the infrastructure by users but with no guarantees as to the amounts that will be paid to
        the operator under a simple pass through or shadow toll agreement
        under this model the right to receive toll payments or other remuneration is recognised in the concession operators balance sheet under
        concession intangible assets this right corresponds to the fair value of the asset under concession plus the borrowing costs capitalised
        during the construction phase it is amortised over the term of the arrangement in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the assets
        economic benefits are consumed by the entity starting from the entry into service of the asset
        this treatment applies to most of the infrastructure concessions in particular the motorway networks in france certain bridges and most of
        the parking facilities managed under concession by vinci park
        ˇˇ the grantor the financial asset model applies the operator has an unconditional contractual right to receive payments from the conces
        sion grantor irrespective of the amount of use made of the infrastructure
        under this model the operator recognises a financial asset attracting interest in its balance sheet in consideration for the services it provides
        design construction etc such financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet under loans and receivables in an amount correspond
        ing to the fair value of the infrastructure on first recognition and subsequently at amortised cost the receivable is settled by means of the
        grantors payments received the financial income calculated on the basis of the effective interest rate equivalent to the projects internal
        rate of return is recognised under operating income

        in the case of bifurcated models the operator is remunerated partly by users and partly by the grantor the part of the investment that is
        covered by an unconditional right to receive payments from the grantor in the form of grants or rental is recognised as a financial receivable
        up to the amount guaranteed the unguaranteed balance of which the amount is dependent on the extent of use of the infrastructure is
        recognised under concession intangible assets


36     sharebased payments
        the measurement and recognition methods for share subscription and purchase plans the plans depargne groupe group savings plans and
        performance share plans are defined by ifrs 2 sharebased payment the granting of share options performance shares and offers to
        subscribe to group savings plans in france and abroad represent a benefit granted to their beneficiaries and therefore constitute supplementary
        remuneration borne by vinci because such transactions do not give rise to monetary transactions the benefits granted in this way are rec
        ognised as expenses in the period in which the rights are acquired with a corresponding increase in equity benefits are measured on the
        basis of the fair value at the grant date of the equity instruments granted
        benefits granted under share option plans performance share plans and group savings plans are implemented as decided by vincis board
        of directors after approval by the shareholders general meeting and are not in general systematically renewed as their measurement is
        not directly linked to the business lines operations vinci has considered it appropriate not to include the corresponding expense in the
        operating income from ordinary activities which is an indicator of business lines performance but to report it on a separate line labelled
        sharebased payment expense ifrs 2 in operating income

361   share subscription or purchase option plans
        options to subscribe to or purchase shares have been granted to group employees and senior executives for some of these plans definitive
        vesting of share subscription or purchase option plans is conditional on performance conditions stock market performance or financial criteria
        being met the fair value of options is determined at grant date using the monte carlo valuation model taking account of the impact of the
        market performance condition if applicable the monte carlo model allows a larger number of scenarios to be modelled by including in
        particular the valuation of assumptions about beneficiaries behaviour on the basis of historical observations

362   performance share plans
        performance shares subject to vesting conditions have been granted to group employees and senior executives as these are plans under
        which the final vesting of the shares may be dependent on the realisation of financial criteria the fair value of the shares has been estimated
        at grant date taking account of the likelihood of the financial criteria being met as recommended by ifrs 2

      vinci 2012 annual report                              consolidated financial statements                                                                 207




              the number of performance shares measured at fair value in the calculation of the ifrs 2 expense is adjusted at each balance sheet date for
              the impact of the change in the likelihood of the financial criteria being met

363         group savings plans
              in france vinci issues new shares reserved for its employees three times a year with a subscription price that includes a discount against the
              average stock market price of the vinci share during the last 20 business days preceding the authorisation by the board of directors this
              discount is considered as a benefit granted to the employees its fair value is determined using the monte carlo valuation model at the date
              on which the subscription price is announced to the employees as certain restrictions apply to the sale or transfer of shares acquired by
              employees under these plans the fair value of the benefit to the employee takes account of the fact that the shares acquired cannot be freely
              disposed of for five years other than in certain specific circumstances
              the group recognises the benefits granted in this way to its employees as an expense over the vesting period with a corresponding increase
              in consolidated equity
              outside france in accordance with authorisations given to the board of directors by the shareholders general meeting vinci has set up
              group savings plans for the employees of certain foreign subsidiaries in 14 countries these plans have different characteristics from those
              for employees in france partly to ensure that the plans value is consistent across all countries despite varying tax and regulatory arrange
              ments details of the plans are set out in the relevant note to the financial statements


37           cost of net financial debt
              the cost of net financial debt includes
              ˇˇ the cost of gross financial debt which includes the interest expense calculated at the effective interest rate and gains and losses on interest
              rate derivatives allocated to gross financial debt whether designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not and
              ˇˇ the line item financial income from cash management investments which comprises the return on investments of cash and cash equiva
              lents investments of cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value through profit or loss


38           other financial income and expense
              other financial income and expense comprises mainly foreign exchange gains and losses the effects of discounting to present value dividends
              received from unconsolidated entities capitalised borrowing costs and changes in the value of derivatives not allocated to managing interest
              rate or exchange rate risk
              borrowing costs borne during construction relate to concession assets and are mainly included in the cost of those assets they are determined
              as follows
              ˇˇ to the extent that funds are borrowed specifically for the purpose of constructing an asset the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation
              on that asset are the actual borrowing costs incurred during the period less any investment income arising from the temporary investment
              of those borrowings
              ˇˇ when borrowing is not intended to finance a specific project the interest eligible for capitalisation on an asset is determined by applying a
              capitalisation rate to the expenditure on that asset this capitalisation rate is equal to the weighted average of the costs of borrowing funds
              for construction work other than those specifically intended for the construction of given assets
              this does not relate to the construction of infrastructure under concession accounted for using the financial asset model see note a3202
              loans and receivables at amortised cost


39           income tax
              income tax is computed in accordance with the tax legislation in force in the countries where the income is taxable
              in accordance with ias 12 deferred tax is recognised on the temporary differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of assets
              and liabilities it is calculated using the latest tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the accounts closing date which are applied
              according to the schedule for reversing temporary differences the effects of a change in the tax rate from one period to another are recognised
              in the income statement in the period in which the change occurs
              deferred tax relating to items recognised directly under equity in particular sharebased payment expenses under ifrs 2 is also recognised
              under equity
              whenever subsidiaries have distributable reserves a deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of the probable distributions that will be
              made in the foreseeable future moreover shareholdings in companies accounted for under the equity method give rise to recognition of a
              deferred tax liability in respect of all the differences between the carrying amount and the tax base of the shares
              net deferred tax is determined on the basis of the tax position of each entity or group of entities included in the tax group under consideration
              and is shown under assets or liabilities for its net amount per taxable entity deferred tax is reviewed at each balance sheet date to take account
              in particular of the impact of changes in tax law and the prospect of recovery deferred tax assets are only recognised if their recovery is
              probable
              deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted


310          earnings per share
              basic earnings per share is the net income for the period after noncontrolling interests divided by the weighted average number of shares
              outstanding during the period less treasury shares
              in calculating diluted earnings per share the average number of shares outstanding is adjusted for the dilutive effect of equity instruments
              issued by the company in particular share subscription or purchase options and performance shares


311          concession intangible assets
              concession intangible assets correspond to the concession operators right to operate the asset under concession in consideration for the
              investment expenditures incurred for the design and construction of the asset this operators right corresponds to the fair value of the con
              struction of the asset under concession plus the borrowing costs capitalised during the construction phase it is amortised over the term of
              the contract in a manner that reflects the pattern in which the contracts economic benefits are consumed by the entity starting from the

208                                                 consolidated financial statements




       date when the right to operate starts to be used for concessions that have recently entered into service the amortisation is calculated using
       the progressive straightline or diminishing balance method on the basis of the forecast traffic levels included in the business plan in the
       particular case of the motorway operating companies asf cofiroute and escota the straightline method is used


312   goodwill
       goodwill is the excess of the cost of a business combination over the groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets
       liabilities and contingent liabilities at the dates of acquisition recognised on first consolidation
       goodwill in fully consolidated subsidiaries is recognised under goodwill in consolidated assets goodwill relating to companies accounted for
       under the equity method is included in the line item investments in companies accounted for under the equity method
       goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired whenever
       goodwill is impaired the difference between its carrying amount and its recoverable amount is charged to operating income in the period
       and is not reversible
       negative goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss in the year of acquisition

       following adoption of ifrs 3 revised an option is available to measure noncontrolling interests on the acquisition date either at fair value
       the full goodwill method or for the portion of the net assets acquired that they represent the partial goodwill method the choice can be
       made for each business combination


313   other intangible assets
       other intangible assets mainly comprise operating rights brands quarrying rights of finite duration and computer software other purchased
       intangible assets are measured at cost less any amortisation or cumulative impairment losses quarrying rights are amortised as materials
       are extracted volumes extracted during the period are compared with the estimated total volume to be extracted from the quarry over its
       useful life in order to reflect the decline in value due to depletion other intangible assets are amortised on a straightline basis over their
       useful life


314   grants related to assets
       grants related to assets are presented in the balance sheet as a reduction of the amount of the asset for which they were received


315   property plant and equipment
       items of property plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition or production cost less cumulative depreciation and any impairment
       losses they are not revalued they also include concession operating assets that are not controlled by the grantor but that are necessary for
       operation of the concession such as buildings intended for use in the operation equipment for toll collection signage data transmission and
       videosurveillance and vehicles and equipment

       depreciation is generally calculated on a straightline basis over the period of use of the asset accelerated depreciation may however be
       used when it appears more appropriate to the conditions under which the asset is used for certain complex assets comprising several com
       ponents in particular buildings and constructions each component of the asset is depreciated over its own period of use in the particular
       case of quarries they are depreciated as materials are extracted volumes extracted during the period are compared with the estimated total
       volume to be extracted from the quarry over its useful life in order to reflect the consumption of the economic benefits

       the main periods of use of the various categories of items of property plant and equipment are as follows

       constructions
        structure                                                                                                                   between 20 and 50 years
        general technical installations                                                                                              between 5 and 20 years

318       impairment of nonfinancial noncurrent assets
           under certain circumstances impairment tests must be performed on intangible assets and property plant and equipment for intangible
           assets with an indefinite useful life goodwill and construction work in progress a test is performed at least annually and whenever there is
           an indication of a loss of value for other fixed assets a test is performed only when there is an indication of a loss of value in accordance with
           ias 36 the criteria adopted to assess indications that an asset might be impaired are either external eg a material change in market condi
           tions or internal eg a material reduction in revenue without distinction
           assets to be tested for impairment are grouped within cashgenerating units that correspond to homogeneous groups of assets that generate
           identifiable cash inflows from their use whenever the recoverable value of a cashgenerating unit is less than its carrying amount an impair
           ment loss is recognised in operating income the recoverable amount of a cashgenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell
           and its value in use value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cashgenerating unit
           the discount rate is determined for each cashgenerating unit taking account of its geographical location and the risk profile of its
           business


319       investments in companies accounted for under the equity method
           equityaccounted investments are initially recognised at cost of acquisition including any goodwill arising their carrying amount is then
           increased or decreased to recognise the groups share of the entitys profits or losses after the date of acquisition whenever losses are greater
           than the value of the groups net investment in the equityaccounted entity these losses are not recognised unless the group has entered
           into a commitment to recapitalise the entity or provide it with funding the share of the negative net equity of companies accounted for under
           the equity method arising from decreases in the fair value of financial hedging instruments is presented under provisions for financial risks
           if there is an indication that an investment may be impaired its recoverable value is tested as described in note a318 impairment of non
           financial noncurrent assets impairment losses shown by these impairment tests are recognised as a deduction from the carrying amount
           of the corresponding investments
           in order to present business lines operational performance in the best way possible the income or loss of companies accounted for under
           the equity method is reported on a specific line between the operating income from ordinary activities and operating income lines

           ably the securities continue to be measured at their original cost ie their cost of acquisition plus transaction costs
           changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity
           whenever there is an objective indication that such an asset is impaired the corresponding loss is recognised in profit or loss and may not be
           reversed
           ˇˇ for securities quoted on an active market a longlasting or material decline in fair value below their cost is an objective indication of their
           impairment the factors considered by the group in assessing the longlasting or material nature of a decline in fair value are generally the
           following
            the impairment is longlasting whenever the closing stock market price has been lower than the cost of the security for more than 18 months
            the impairment is material whenever at the balance sheet date there has been a 30 fall in the current market price compared with the
           cost of the financial asset
           ˇˇ for unlisted securities the factors considered are the decrease in value of the share of equity held and the absence of prospects for gen
           erating profits

           grantor
           when first recognised these loans and receivables are recognised at their fair value less the directly attributable transaction costs at each
           balance sheet date these assets are measured at their amortised cost using the effective interest method in the particular case of receivables
           coming under the scope of ifric 12 the effective interest rate used corresponds to the projects internal rate of return
           if there is an objective indication of impairment of these loans and receivables an impairment loss is recognised at the balance sheet date
           the impairment loss which corresponds to the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount ie the present value
           of the expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate is recognised in profit or loss this loss may be reversed if the
           recoverable value increases subsequently and if this favourable change can objectively be linked to an event arising after recognition of the
           impairment loss

         ing is applicable in particular if the conditions provided for in ias 39 are satisfied
         ˇˇ at the time of setting up the hedge there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship
         ˇˇ the effectiveness of the hedging relationship must be demonstrated from the outset and at each balance sheet date prospectively and
         retrospectively
         the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of which the maturity is greater than one year is reported in the balance
         sheet under other noncurrent financial assets or other loans and borrowings noncurrent the fair value of other derivative instruments

         changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognised in profit or loss for the period the change in value of the hedged item
         attributable to the hedged risk is recognised symmetrically in profit or loss for the period and adjusted to the carrying amount of the hedged
         item except for the ineffective portion of the hedge these two revaluations offset each other within the same line items in the income
         statement

         cash flow hedge
         a cash flow hedge allows exposure to variability in future cash flows associated with an existing asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
         transaction to be hedged
         changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in equity for the effective portion and in profit or loss for the
         period for the ineffective portion cumulative gains or losses in equity are taken to profit or loss under the same line item as the hedged item
          ie under operating income and expenses for cash flows from operations and under financial income and expense otherwise  when the
         hedged cash flow affects profit or loss
         if the hedging relationship is interrupted because it is no longer considered effective the cumulative gains or losses in respect of the derivative
         instrument are retained in equity and recognised symmetrically with the cash flow hedged if the future cash flow is no longer expected the
         gains and losses previously recognised in equity are taken to profit or loss

         hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity
         a hedge of a net investment denominated in a foreign currency hedges the exchange rate risk relating to the net investment in a consolidated
         foreign subsidiary in a similar way as for cash flow hedges the effective portion of the changes in the value of the derivative instrument is
         recorded in equity under currency translation reserves and the portion considered as ineffective is recognised in profit or loss the change in
         the value of the hedging instrument recognised in translation differences is reversed through profit or loss when the foreign entity in which
         the initial investment was made is disposed of

         derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments
         derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments are reported in the balance sheet at fair value and changes

              details of results of hedging derivatives are shown in the table below


             the cost of net financial debt amounted to 6377 million in 2012 compared with 6466 million in 2011 a decrease of 89 million due mainly
             to a 130 million reduction in the cost of longterm financial debt arising from
             ˇˇ a fall of around 174 million in average debt outstanding due to differences between the amounts of debt repayment and refinancing
             transactions see note e221 detail of longterm financial debt
             ˇˇ an improvement in the average interest rate due to the impact of lower shortterm rates on the cost of debt at floating and capped floating
             rates
             ˇˇ the rates applied to new bond issues in 2011 and 2012 which were lower overall than the average rate of debts redeemed during the period
             interest received on net cash decreased as the increase of around 100 million in the average amount of net cash did not offset the impact
             of lower interest rates in 2012

             other financial income includes borrowing costs included in the cost of noncurrent assets under construction in an amount of 713 million
             in 2012 including 701 million for the asf group compared with 609 million in 2011 including 594 million for the asf group

             other financial expense includes the effects of discounting assets and liabilities at more than one year to present value for 913 million in
             2012 compared with 473 million in 2011
             the effect of discounting to present value relates mainly to provisions for retirement benefit obligations for 427 million in 2012 414 million

8            earnings per share
              basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period less the weighted
              average number of treasury shares

              diluted earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares that would have been outstanding had all
              potentially dilutive instruments in particular share subscription or purchase options and performance shares been converted into shares
              earnings are also adjusted as necessary for changes in income and expenses resulting from the conversion into shares of all potentially dilutive
              instruments

              the dilution resulting from the exercise of share subscription and purchase options and from performance shares is determined using the
              method defined in ias 33 in accordance with this standard plans of which the stock market price is greater than the average price during the
              period are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation

13       impairment tests on goodwill and other nonfinancial assets
          in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets goodwill and other nonfinancial assets were tested for impairment at 31 december 2012

          cashgenerating units cgus are identified in line with operational reporting and their recoverable amounts are based on a value in use
          calculation the value in use of each cgu is determined by discounting the forecasted operating cash flows before tax operating income plus
          depreciation and amortisation plus noncurrent provisions less operating investments less change in operating wcr at the rates below

          in the case of concessions forecast cash flows are determined across the length of contracts by applying a variable discount rate determined
          for each period depending on the debt to equity ratio of the entity in question

          for the other cgus forecast cash flows are generally determined on the basis of the latest threeyear forecasts available for periods beyond
          the threeyear period cash flows are extrapolated until the fifth year generally using a growth rate based on managements assessment of
          the outlook for the entity under consideration
          beyond the fifth year the terminal value is determined by capitalising cash flows to infinity

       whenever events such as late completion or disputes about the execution of a contract make it likely that a liability covered by a guarantee
       will materialise a provision is taken in respect of that liability

       in general under the rules in force any risk of loss in connection with performance of a commitment given by vinci or its subsidiaries would
       result in a provision being recognised in the groups financial statements vinci therefore considers that the offbalance sheet commitments
       above are unlikely to have a material impact on group assets

       vinci also grants aftersales service warranties covering several years in its normal course of business these warranties when set up lead
       to provisions estimated on a statistical basis having regard to past experience or on an individual basis in the case of any major problems
       identified these commitments are therefore not included in the above table

       moreover in connection with the construction of the future south europe atlantic highspeed rail line between tours and bordeaux the group
       has in particular provided a joint and several guarantee and an independent first demand guarantee in favour of lisea under which the group
       guarantees contract performance by the design and construction joint venture gie cosea

193      group savings plans
          vincis board of directors defines the conditions for subscribing to the group savings plans in accordance with the authorisations granted to
          it by the shareholders general meeting

          in france vinci issues new shares reserved for employees three times a year at a subscription price that includes a discount against the average
          stock market price over 20 trading days this discount was 10 up to the plan for the third fourmonth period of 2012 and was reduced to 5
          in the plan for the first fourmonth period of 2013 subscribers benefit from an employer contribution with an annual maximum of 3500 per
          person this maximum figure has been reduced to 2500 from the plan for the first fourmonth period of 2013 the benefits granted in this
          way to group employees are recognised in profit or loss and are valued in accordance with ifrs 2 on the basis of the following assumptions
          ˇˇ length of subscription period four months
          ˇˇ length of period during which funds are frozen five years


          the estimated number of shares subscribed to at the end of the subscription period is calculated based on a linear regression method applied
          to historical observations of the plans between 2002 and 2012 taking account of the cost of restrictions on the availability of units in the
          savings fund

          the opportunity cost of the frozen shares subscribed to is estimated from the point of view of a third party holding a diversified portfolio and
          prepared to acquire the frozen shares in return for a discount which should correspond to the return demanded by a purchaser on own funds
          allocated to hedge against market risk over the period in which the shares are frozen five years the market risk is assessed on an annual
          basis applying a valueatrisk approach

          in 2012 in accordance with authorisations given to the board of directors by the shareholders general meeting and pursuant to a decision
          taken by the chairman and chief executive officer on 5 march 2012 vinci initiated savings plans for the employees of certain foreign sub
          sidiaries known as castor international the plans cover 14 countries belgium canada the czech republic germany morocco netherlands
          poland portugal romania slovakia spain switzerland the uk and the usa
          these plans aim to reconcile variations in tax regimes and regulations between countries so that their value for employees is consistent their
          main characteristics are as follows
          ˇˇ purchases of vinci shares at no discount through reserved capital increases or purchases in the market
          ˇˇ subscription period four weeks ended 13 april 2012 nine successive periods between march and november 2012 in the uk
          ˇˇ employer contribution consisting of bonus shares with delivery deferred for three years where possible or with immediate delivery but a
          threeyear vesting period
          ˇˇ no lockup period beyond the threeyear vesting period for bonus shares
          the employer contribution paid in shares represents the benefit granted by the group to foreign employees who have subscribed to the plans
          this benefit is recognised as an expense over the vesting period in this case three years

231       interest rate risk
           interest rate risk is managed within the group making a distinction between the concessions business the contracting business and holding
           companies as their respective financial profiles are not the same

           for concession operating subsidiaries interest rate risk is managed with two timescales the long term aiming to ensure and maintain the
           concessions economic equilibrium and the short term with an objective of optimising the average cost of debt depending on the situation
           in financial markets
           over the long term the objective is to change over time the breakdown between fixed and floating rate debt depending on the debt level
           measured by the ratio of net debt to cash flows from operations before tax and financing costs with a greater proportion at fixed rate when
           the level of debt is high
           as regards contracting activities and holding companies they have a structural net cash surplus because the contracting subsidiaries cash
           surpluses of which the management is mainly centralised under the cash pooling system are higher than the holding companies debt for
           these activities the objective is to ensure that the risks connected with financial assets and financial liabilities are well matched

           to hedge its interest rate risk the group uses derivative financial instruments in the form of options or swaps of which the start may be
           deferred these derivatives may be designated as hedges for accounting purposes or not in accordance with the ifrss

2311   sensitivity to interest rate risk
         vinci is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates given
         ˇˇ the cash flows connected with net floating rate debt
         ˇˇ fixed rate financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet at fair value through profit or loss
         ˇˇ derivative financial instruments that are not designated as hedges these mainly comprise net call option positions of which the maximum
         loss over the life of the transaction is equal to the premium paid

         on the other hand fluctuations in the value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity and have no effect
         on profit or loss

         the analysis below has been prepared assuming that the amount of the financial debt and derivatives at 31 december 2012 remains constant
         over one year the consequence of a variation in interest rates of 25 basis points at the balance sheet date would be an increase or decrease
         of equity and pretax income for the amounts shown below for the purpose of this analysis the other variables are assumed to remain
         constant

           generally the groups activities in foreign countries are financed by loans in the local currency
           debts in foreign currency of subsidiaries of which the operating currency is the euro mainly vinci and asf have been hedged at their time
           of issue and do not generate any exposure to exchange rate risk


2333     nature of the groups risk exposure
           74 of vincis business is in the eurozone the groups exposure to currency risk is therefore limited transactions outside the eurozone are
           generally made in the local currency for permanent establishments and to a great extent in euros and dollars in the case of major export
           projects

           vinci may find itself exposed to currency risk whenever in isolated cases the parent company provides finance to certain foreign subsidiaries
           and on cash flows intended to be paid to the parent company this exposure is generally covered by cross currency swaps or forward exchange
           transactions

           vincis foreign currency risk management policy consists of hedging the transactional risk connected with subsidiaries ordinary
           operations
           however vinci does not systematically hedge the currency risk connected with its foreign investments resulting in translation exposure

           there remains a residual exposure on some assets that have not been designated as hedges a 10 appreciation of foreign currencies against

234   commodity risks
       most of the groups revenue arises either from contracts that include price revision clauses or under shortterm contracts the risks associ
       ated with an increase in commodity prices are therefore generally limited
       for major contracts with no price revision clauses the commodity risks are analysed on a casebycase basis and managed in particular by
       negotiating firm price agreements with suppliers andor through cashandcarry deals andor hedging derivatives based on commodity
       indexes
       for its small contracts in france of which the average length is less than three months and which do not include price revision clauses eurovia
       has set up a policy to manage bitumen price risks by putting in place shortmaturity hedging derivatives swaps of less than three months on
       average

       vinci is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by its customers and to counterparty risk in respect of its investments of cash credit
       balances at banks negotiable debt securities term deposits marketable securities etc subscription to derivatives commitments received
       sureties and guarantees received unused authorised credit facilities and financial receivables

       the group has set up procedures to manage and limit credit risk and counterparty risk

       trade receivables
       approximately 35 of consolidated revenue is generated with public sector or quasipublic sector customers moreover vinci considers that
       the concentration of credit risk connected with trade receivables is limited because of the large number of customers and the fact that they
       are widely scattered across france and other countries no customer accounts for more than 10 of vincis revenue in foreign countries and
       in developing countries the risk of nonpayment is generally covered by appropriate insurance policies coface documentary credit etc
       trade receivables are broken down in note e212 breakdown of trade receivables

       financial instruments cash investments and derivatives

       group has also set up a system of counterparty limits to manage its counterparty risk maximum risk amounts by counterparty are defined
       taking account of their credit ratings as published by standard  poors and moodys the limits are regularly monitored and updated on the
       basis of a consolidated quarterly reporting system
       the group finance department also distributes instructions to the subsidiaries laying down the authorised limits by counterparty the list of

       part of vincis business in the construction and roads business lines is conducted through unincorporated joint venture partnerships seps
       in line with industry practice in partnerships partners are legally jointly and severally liable for that entitys debts to nongroup companies
       without limit in this context the group may set up crossed counter guarantees with its partners

       whenever the group is aware of a particular risk relating to a joint venture partnerships activity a provision is taken in the consolidated financial
       statements

          the amount shown under offbalance sheet commitments in respect of joint and several guarantees is the groups share of the liabilities of
          the partnerships in question less equity and financial debt loans or current account advances due to partners

          divide the proceedings in order to deal with the defendants strikeout applications first and with the substantive issues second ordering
          the parties to attend a case management hearing this application by the regional authority was further to a judgment by the paris appeal
          court on 27 february 2007 against various natural persons finding them guilty of operating a cartel as well as to the decision on 9 may 2007

on the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 december 2012
             to the shareholders

             in accordance with our appointment as statutory auditors by your shareholders general meeting we hereby report to you for the year ended
             31 december 2012 on
             ˇˇ the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of vinci sa
             ˇˇ the justification of our assessments and
             ˇˇ the specific verification required by law
             the consolidated financial statements have been approved by the board of directors our role is to express an opinion on these financial
             statements based on our audit



1           opinion on the consolidated financial statements
             we conducted our audit in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france those standards require that we plan and perform
             the audit in such a way as to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement an audit
             consists of examining by sampling or other selection methods evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
             statements an audit also consists of assessing the accounting principles used significant estimates made and the overall presentation of the
             financial statements we believe that the information that we have collected provides a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion
             in our opinion the consolidated financial statements for the period give a true and fair view of the financial position the assets and liabilities
             and the results of the group formed by the persons and entities included in the consolidation in accordance with the international financial
             reporting standards as endorsed by the european union



2           justification of our assessments
             as required by article l8239 of the french commercial code relating to the justification of our assessments we inform you of the
             following
             ˇˇ as stated in note a31 the vinci group uses estimates prepared on the basis of information available at the time of preparing its conso
             lidated financial statements in a context of economic and financial crisis in europe where the mediumterm outlook for business is difficult
             to assess due to the impacts on financial market volatility access to financing and economic growth these estimates relate in particular to
              construction contracts the vinci group recognises income from its longterm contracts using the percentage of completion method on
             the basis of the best available estimates of the final outcome of contracts as stated in note a34 we have assessed the assumptions used
             by the company in making these estimates and reviewed the calculations made
              impairment tests on nonfinancial assets the vinci group performs impairment tests at least annually on goodwill and also assesses
             whether there is any indication that longterm assets may be impaired in accordance with the methodology described in notes a318 and
             e13 to the consolidated financial statements we have examined how these impairment tests are performed and the cash flow forecasts and
             assumptions used
             these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and have therefore contributed
             to the formation of our opinion given in the first part of this report



3           specific verification
             we have also verified in accordance with the professional standards applicable in france and as required by law the information concerning
             the group presented in the report of the board of directors
             we have no comments to make as to its fair presentation and its conformity with the consolidated financial statements


                                                                          parisla défense and neuilly sur seine 7 february 2013
