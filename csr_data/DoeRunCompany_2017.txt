message from the ceo
   sustainability2016doeruncom messagefromtheceo

for much of 2016 doe run continued to face challenges from depressed metal prices regulatory capital spending
requirements and other regulatory uncertainty in order to adjust to these conditions we had to make a number of
tough choices those included the difficult decisions to curtail production and to reduce our workforce at several
locations early in the year

despite this period of uncertainty doe run continued progress on process and equipment improvements as well as
a program of cost reductions so that we could be poised to capitalize on a lead price rebound fortunately our
efforts paid off and lead prices began to improve toward the end of 2016

adapting now to prepare for the future

as we prioritized projects for 2016 we focused on those that met our commitments to workforce safety
environmental standards and customer needs as well as projects that would prepare our company for the economic
opportunities of a pricing rebound

in 2016 doe run completed our multimillion dollar equipment update at the resource recycling facility these
improvements included

    better workforce safety
    enhanced productivity and processing capability
    stronger competitiveness for the future

read more on how we delivered on this commitment here

innovative upgrades also occurred at brushy creek mill where adjustments to our milling process improved mineral
recovery and product consistency and provided a new method to sustainably reuse our water resources read
more on our updated water management

we continue to make progress on converting the former smelter site in herculaneum for new use in 2016 doe run
sold 18 acres of previously leased riverfront property to riverview commerce park llc this property sale
represents a longterm commitment to herculaneum for the mississippi river shipping port which is changing the
economic future for the community read more about repurposing efforts at the former smelter site

continuous improvement in the face of challenges

market prices are just one of the challenges facing the mining and metal production industries our current and long
term success depends on our ability to adapt to a constantly changing regulatory environment and maintaining a
skilled workforce

as we face these challenges were driven by our commitment to balance our social environmental and economic
responsibilities set forth in our sustainability principles we continually strive to be good stewards of the
environment and maintain the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate

during periods of low lead prices the financial costs of the changing regulatory environment became increasingly
challenging according to a report for the national association of manufacturers  companies in the manufacturing
sector spend on average 13750 per employee each year just to meet federal regulations during the last five
years doe run incurred more than 343 million in environmental expenses  or roughly 57000 per employee in

2016 alone these expenses included 71 million on efforts to limit the impact of our operations and improve energy
and water use as an example we opened two 12 million water treatment plants at sweetwater mine and in
viburnum as part of updating our water management approach at the southeast missouri mining  milling division
semo

our success as a company and an industry depends on protecting the health and safety of our employees
contractors and communities in 2015 international lead association ila members established the goal of
reducing employee bloodlead levels to below 30 μgdl our goal is to reduce the number of employees at each
location who surpass 19 μgdl by proactively monitoring employees bloodlead levels which we accomplished at
three out of four locations in 2016 in total the average bloodlead level companywide declined to 102 μgdl both
the ila guidelines and doe runs protocols establish lower acceptable bloodlead levels than are required by law

to sustain our vital industry in southeast missouri were focused on attracting talented workers by 2019 the
mining industry needs 78000 workers to replace retirees according to the energy information administration eia
during that same time the industry is expected to grow by about 50000 workers our industry will need to fill
128000 positions by 2019 our efforts to address this challenge include our partnerships and donations to missouri
university of science  technology mineral area college and other schools with miningrelated programs as well
as scholarships and internships to educate the next generation of our workforce read more about our partnerships

opportunities for metals in the future economy

were excited about the future for the metals we mine around the world leadbased batteries power vehicles store
renewable wind and solar energy and provide backup power for critical operations at hospitals and financial centers
market analysts predict demand for leadbased batteries will grow as a result of expanding economies across the
globe growth in hybrid electric vehicles and renewable energy storage demand expands around the globe

doe run is doing its part to support the development of advanced lead batteries to meet these applications as a
member of the advanced lead acid battery consortium and other industry organizations through these industry
coalitions were supporting research and development of advanced uses for our lead that will drive demand for
decades to come new leadbased battery technologies will help the lead industry continue to thrive in missouri

handson training for the future workforce

in addition to missouri st doe run partners with several universities across the country to offer a rigorous hands
on internship program that recruits and trains future mining professionals taylor fels and kathleen tew are two
such individuals

taylor fels environmental engineer

although he was raised in rolla missouri just 60
miles from doe runs southeast missouri min
ing and milling division taylor fels didnt know
much about the industry until he took a tour of
brushy creek mine

he was a mechanical engineering major at mis
souri st in 2011 but discovered environmental
and geological engineering would give him the
opportunity to do more handson work outdoors in
the field
                                                                            taylor fels doe run environmental engineer
you can only learn so much from a text book            a missouri st grad fels completed several internships with doe run before joining
                                                         the company full time to support environmental remediation projects including capping
said fels my internship at doe run helped me                         a slag pile at glover a former primary smelter in missouri

realize what i wanted to do for a living

fels first interned with the company in 2013 he was impressed by the trust the company placed in him to do the
work they trusted me to make the right decisions and gave me the chance to do so he said

the next summer fels moved to minnesota to intern for a consulting firm about one month into that job i realized
i liked doe runs style better shared fels i left the consulting firm midsummer and came back to intern here
and i never left

during the doe run internship fels managed the design and construction oversight of two storm water retention
basins he joined other interns to present the large and important project to the companys executive team

the presentation gives you the chance to see how involved everyone is in the internship program and how
interested they are in what youre doing and what youre learning fels said it also underscores how much the
company values the contributions of the interns

fels continued to work nearly full time as an intern and an environmental technician until he graduated from missou
ri st with a bachelors degree in geological engineering in may 2016 today fels works on several remediation
projects key to helping doe run meet its vision as stewards of the mineral resources in its care

its one of the biggest things i realized as an intern  how big of a role taking care of the environment plays in the
mining industry remediation is a large component of mining we work very hard to be good stewards and protect
the environment fels said

kathleen tew mine planner

kathleen tew literally grew up in mines tagging
along with her father at work all over the country
in fact her ability to drive a haul truck impressed
her doe run coworkers early on in her intern
ship

i rode in haul trucks as a kid and spent time in
underground salt mines in ohio and new york
said tew by the time i completed college id
also experienced a surface coal mine a surface
garnet mine and a cement plant the more i
worked on the surface the more i realized i pre
ferred the complexity of being underground

                                                                                   kathleen tew mine planner
when she was a freshman at the south dakota
                                                            a recent mine and geological engineering graduate tew lives her passion for
school of mines and technology tew decided to             underground mining every day as she analyzes ore bodies and develops plans
                                                                                  for addressing mine conditions
double major in mining engineering and manage
ment and geological engineering tew accepted a
summer internship at doe runs buick mine in 2013

doe run was the most comprehensive internship i did in terms of experience she said they wanted me to really
understand the mining process and everything that goes into it  from extraction to the equipment to how they use
data in planning youre given a chance to do real work and make an impact

tew says that approach helped her understand the importance of good communication between the underground
production crews and the engineering professionals i gained a better understanding of what i needed to do to
make sure what i was producing in my role would be applicable to their work underground said tew i knew one
month into the job that this was the kind of company where i wanted to work everyone seemed to enjoy their jobs
and they were open and willing to teach me

today tew works with the mine captain and foreman on audits analyzing ore bodies and conducting production
planning the best part of my job is also the most challenging part of my job she said the conditions of the mine
are always changing and we have to constantly think of new solutions to problems like the presence of water or
equipment breakdowns its a very interesting place to be

battery recycling delivering on commitments
   sustainability2016doeruncom batteryrecyclingdeliveringcommitments

each day more than 250 million vehicles hit us roads thanks to the power of lead batteries drivers might not
realize many of their journeys began in the viburnum trend with lead and zinc mined by doe run and when
millions of those lead batteries reach the end of their life they return to missouri to be recycled at doe runs
resource recycling facility one of the largest singlesite lead recycling facilities in the world

lead batteries are the most recycled product in the us  more than 99 percent are returned for recycling as global
lead battery demand is expected to grow 34 percent each year through 2021 continuous improvement at resource
recycling is important to meet environmental requirements and customer needs

in 2016 doe run continued a multiyear multimillion dollar investment to update the plants breaking separation
and neutralization bsn system the project improves safety and environmental performance while helping keep
the facility competitive the project improved processing capability and reduced operating and maintenance costs

before 1991 resource recycling was a primary lead smelter  turning lead ore into raw materials used for
production doe run converted the smelter into a battery recycling facility to meet both the growing demand for lead
and public demand for sustainable products doe run has continued to invest in upgrades like the bsn system so
resource recycling can keep pace with evolving technology

we began this modernization process in 2013 including construction of a new baghouse using a negativepressure
ventilation system to minimize the potential of emissions said bruce chamberlain operations manager of doe
runs metals division in november 2016 the new bsn system became operational helping us improve our
processes as well as the needs of our customers and the community

resource recycling recovers more than just lead for its battery customers the polypropylene plastic casing also
can be recycled into new battery cases the new bsn system produces quality recycled plastic by creating fewer
opportunities for cross contamination between the polypropylene and other materials recovering at least 98 percent
of all polypropylene for reuse

doe run partnered with engitec an italian company and world leader in building metal recycling facilities local
contractors at lee mechanical in park hills missouri and schneider electric in st louis were responsible for
installing the new bsn equipment

our battery recycling process
more than 99 percent of lead batteries are recycled in the us which keeps 24 million tons of batteries out of
landfills see diagram below of how doe run employees recycle the lead and other materials from used automobile
batteries giving those components new life


designed for safety

to power a vehicle or store energy from solar panels lead batteries need to be compact but powerful a chemical
reaction in the battery occurs whenever it generates or stores electricity thats why safety is an important factor in
improvements to resource recycling operations during the recycling process workers could be exposed to the
elements that cause the chemical reaction like battery acid which is collected and neutralized in the bsn by adding
hydrated lime

the safety of our employees was key in the new bsn design which uses automation and electronic controls to
reduce exposure to materials from the batteries said rick white bsn manager of doe runs metals division the
new bsn protects employees and improves equipment reliability

the system design also includes shields that limit potential spillage of plastic and leadbearing materials being
shredded these improvements are already contributing to reduced bloodlead levels the trace amount of lead the
body may absorb through exposure in resource recycling employees in 2017

designed for the future

other design features of the new bsn system prepare resource recycling for changes in the battery industry the
updates mean doe run can now recycle increasingly popular absorbed glass mat agm batteries the industry
expects demand to increase for these lighter longlasting leadbased batteries over the next decade particularly for
vehicles and storage of renewable energy

as innovation drives changes in lead battery technologies doe run continues to invest in plant improvements

leadbased batteries start 1 billion cars worldwide and store energy from the growing wind and solar industries
doe run plays a critical role in powering our global economy said chamberlain

lead recycling fast facts

lead batteries are the most recycled and sustainable consumer product in the us

    lead batteries are recycled at a rate of 99 percent compared to just 67 percent of paper 55 percent of
    aluminum and 34 percent of glass according to the environmental protection agency epa
    by comparison only a few companies can recycle lithiumion batteries and less than 1 percent of lithium is
    recycled
    approximately 90 percent of the lead doe run mines goes into leadbased batteries
    since it opened in 1994 doe runs resource recycling facility has recycled approximately 324 million
    batteries enough to circle the globe
    each year doe run recycles enough batteries to cover about 137 football fields keeping used batteries out
    of landfills

rethinking water management
   sustainability2016doeruncom rethinkingwatermanagement

brushy creek mill employees faced a challenge when the quality of its lead and zinc concentrates unexpectedly
declined an investigation discovered that poor process water quality was to blame thanks to collaboration within
the team and with water partner neo solutions doe run discovered a sustainable solution located 1200feet
underneath the mill

brushy creek mill processes approximately 50000 tons of lead concentrates each year the lead ore also contains
smaller amounts of zinc and copper processing these other elements helps doe run diversify its revenue streams
and fulfill its sustainability commitments getting the most from all the natural resources in its mining operations

however a decline in concentrate quality was caused by the process water being used in flotation which separates
lead zinc and copper minerals from the mined rock as good stewards of the estimated 38 million gallons of water
that flow into doe runs six mines and other facilities brushy creek mill was using water pumped from the mine and
held in its tailings ponds for the flotation process to separate the minerals

over time the use and reuse of the process water made the quality too poor to filter lead concentrates effectively
said brian mangogna mill manager at the southeast missouri mining  milling division semo the lead
concentrates contained too much moisture so they had to dry longer before being shipped it affected our business
our transportation partners and our customers




                                             managing water underground and above
                       brian mangogna semo mill manager also oversees water management projects at the site such
                                                  as this diversion path for stormwater




a solution right under their feet

doe run and neo solutions a water management partner evaluated a number of solutions that would both improve
the quality of lead and zinc concentrates and maintain the companys stewardship of the water at its property
instead of reusing process water after it reaches the tailings ponds they developed a system that enables them to
tap the high quality naturally occurring mine water directly from brushy creek mine below

an adjustment in the piping now allows the mine water to enter directly into the mill not only was the quality better

suited for the flotation process the yearround 65degree water temperature has provided unexpected benefits

we know temperature plays a role in the quality of outputs for our mill said mangogna but the switch to using
mine water improved zinc recovery and mill efficiency more than anticipated especially during the winter months
when the outdoor tailings pond is very cold

today a crossfunctional team at the mill stays in communication to make the process work they monitor water
within the mines in the tailings pond and in the mill process and make adjustments as needed for example during
heavy rainfall the mill may need to draw more water from the tailings pond than the mine to help balance the
increased volume caused by the rain

we often celebrate when we make substantial leaps by building new technologies but simple changes and
improvements can create significant positive change said mark yingling  vice president environment health and
safety with the new mine water process in combination with the capabilities of the water treatment plant added to
that site in 2014 brushy creek mill serves as an example of how we can optimize our infrastructure to be a better
steward of our natural resources and environmental responsibilities

the team from brushy creek mill has shared its knowledge about managing water systems for sustainable reuse of
water resources with doe runs other locations in 2017 fletcher mine and mill began similar work to pump
underground water for use at the mill

additional water management efforts

in 2017 doe run will complete a 75 million overhaul of its water management program at semo the fiveyear
program to upgrade and advance the companys water management adds hightech water treatment plants that use
a chemical process to treat mine and mill water to meet permit limits two water treatment plants costing 286
million opened in 2016 at sweetwater mine and in viburnum a final plant at west fork mine is scheduled to be
completed in the summer of 2017

the new plants improve flexibility and treatment options at the facilities the plants can treat up to 10000 gallons of
water per minute 5500 gallons more than the first plant which was constructed at brushy creek mine the final
plant at west fork mine will be able to process up to 18000 gallons per minute

weve learned that we needed more flexibility in our water capacity given the types of weather we encounter in
missouri and made the necessary adjustments said samantha anderson senior environmental scientist at semo

the four completed water treatment plants processed more than 5 billion gallons of water in 2016

how do you drive economic growth after business changes and environmental regulations have altered the
landscape closing 70000 us factories and eliminated more than 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000

doe run and the city of herculaneum are determined to overcome those hurdles and use the former smelter site as
a catalyst for renewed economic vitality in the community

we have a unified vision among the city of herculaneum our residents and doe run to work together to improve
the city by creating new jobs growing our tax base and providing quality of life for our community said jim kasten
city administrator for herculaneum today doe run owns some of the biggest pieces of property in the city and our
hope is that these areas can be repurposed and transformed for industrial business opportunities over the next 10
years

from a stateoftheart port on the mississippi river to an allabilities playground in herculaneum doe run
remediation work embraces a responsibility to bring new opportunities to the sites and communities once occupied
by its mining and metal operations

preparing for future economy

doe run and its predecessor st joseph lead company were a big contributor to building and expanding the river
rail and road infrastructure that spurred development in the town of herculaneum thanks to investments in
remediation at the lead smelter and updates to the onsite infrastructure doe run helped to bring new industry to
the area through the riverview commerce park llc rcp shipping port

in 2016 doe run sold 18 acres of previously leased riverfront property to rcp securing a longterm commitment to
herculaneum rcp also increased shipping capacity in herculaneum by opening a second loading dock

we are pleased that our work to repurpose the property helped draw new opportunities to the area said chris
neaville doe runs asset development director as we continue the cleanup process at the smelter we hope to
identify additional ways the land can benefit local businesses and the herculaneum community

doe run remediation efforts continue at the former smelter property and surrounding area in 2016 crews removed
5000 tons of leadbearing materials from the plant for recycling other work at the site included moving slag a
glassy sandlike material leftover from smelting situated on the north end of the property to a new slag storage area
at the south end and the next step will be to cap it with soil all remediation work is done under guidance from the
environmental protection agency

as part of its remediation commitments doe run continues work on the land houses and public buildings located
immediately next to the smelter property several houses and other buildings already have been removed including
assumption catholic church so the company can prepare those properties for reuse

                              granddaughters at kades playground an allabilities playground in herculaneum




bringing value to the community

when dennis mitchell began his job at the herculaneum smelter fresh out of high school he never imagined that 43
years later hed prepare nearby property for a playground that he now visits with his own grandchildren

mitchell spent his entire career with doe run and called herculaneum home for most of that time for 12 years
mitchell served as general maintenance supervisor at the smelter today mitchell oversees doe run remediation at
the site this includes soil remediation and landscaping of land once owned by doe run to create kades
playground an allinclusive playground that is accessible to children of all ages and abilities

for people who have spent their lives in herculaneum doe run has always been the cog in the wheel that kept
this city viable mitchell said even a small contribution to support a playground helps make herculaneum an
attractive community that can sustain families for years to come

mitchell and his wife raised their daughter in herculaneum now when she visits with mitchells two
granddaughters they go to kades playground together

the playground opened in 2015 and is named in memory of kade bauman a local child who used a wheelchair and
wanted to bring an inclusive playground to jefferson county kades playground was designed so that children of all
abilities can play together all structures include ramps so wheelchairs can access them the playground also has
highback swings a spongy playing surface and musical instruments

doe run helped build this town as a good neighbor we are doing everything we can to maintain herculaneum as
a place where people want to live and raise their families mitchell said

                                                           glover remediation
                        doe run continued remediation at the former smelter including removing lead material from the
                             blast furnace building and capping the slag storage area with soil and native grass




additional remediation projects

as the last remaining lead mining company in the area doe run manages remediation of several historic mine sites
that once belonged to its predecessor companies

doe run continues remediation at the former smelter in glover missouri glover currently serves as a facility for
storing and shipping doe runs ore concentrates but could one day have the potential to serve as an industrial
park in 2016 crews removed lead material and equipment from the glover blast furnace building and baghouse
crews also capped the slag pile and planted grass to cover it

our hope is that the glover facility  when its decommissioned and ready for repurposing  will be a good site for
other employers said neaville the area has railroad access and is remote with about 4000 acres of buffer land
we think it offers many benefits that would be attractive to several industries

doe run also oversees remediation at the block p mine site in montana block p was owned by doe runs
predecessor st joseph lead company in 2017 the company will reroute a stream near the mine doe run crews
also are working to cover chat piles to minimize contact with mine waste in treece kansas the chat piles were left
by kansas exploration a st joseph lead company subsidiary

leads late rebound
   sustainability2016doeruncom leadslaterebound

leadbased batteries start nearly 1 billion vehicles every day they also provide energy storage for mobile
communications data centers and emergency equipment and help to move commercial products in warehouses
across our country lead batteries are truly foundational to the energy needs of modern society at the end of their
life lead batteries are the single most recycled consumer product their lead metal and plastic cases recovered
recycled and reused for new batteries given the value of lead in modern society tracking the changes to the global
market is a daily function of doe run

2016 was a fickle year for lead with the lead metal prices dipping to 073 per pound in january before making a
late comeback toward the end of the year the longawaited lead rebound meant mining companies like doe run
that had taken measures over the past two to three years to weather low lead prices could breathe a sigh of relief

looking back

lower lead metal prices seen particularly in 2015 and 2016 were driven by a coolingoff period in global economic
growth brought on by loan defaults in portugal spain and greece and a softening of the chinese economy

during the last decade chinas doubledigit economic growth spurred the global economy and the lead market but
in 2015 and 2016 chinas growth moderated to a more sustainable rate of 5 to 6 percent annual growth as a
result we entered a period of oversupply in the global lead market

as a global business the economies around the world impact our company said steve batts vice president 
southeast missouri operations we adjusted our output to adapt to the market and enable us to operate
sustainably

doe run was not the only company that adjusted its mine output several other large mines also curtailed
production including mines in ireland and australia globally newly mined lead output declined 28 percent yearon
year and refined production primary and secondary increased by 27 percent

newly mined lead supplies about 45 percent of the global demand for lead the remaining nearly 55 percent of
refined lead is supplied from lead recycling in 2014 and 2015 there was tightness in the scrap lead metal market
which supplies north american battery recyclers secondary smelters for battery recyclers like doe run this
meant increased costs for scrap lead and narrower margins the closure of a secondary smelter in california in
2016 did not completely ease the tightness since the market is further complicated by exports of lead battery scrap

lead demand on the rise

                                                          sustainable energy growth
                        the use of lead batteries in wind and solar energy storage the expansion of cellular networks in
                       developing countries and hybrid electric vehicles represents growing demand for this versatile and
                                                                 recyclable metal



future demand for lead will be driven by growing demand for mobility in developing countries greater electrification
of vehicles and the rapid expansion of renewable energy storage around the globe these technological changes 
powered by lead batteries  have analysts forecasting global demand to grow by 2 percent yearoveryear after
years of depressed prices because of an oversupply of lead companies like doe run should benefit from increased
demand and analysts expect demand to outpace supply of newly mined lead ore by 2023 anticipated new mine
projects will be required to meet the demand

today global lead demand remains driven largely by china in 2016 vehicle production in china increased 145
percent yearoveryear for a record production of 28 million vehicles china also continues to expand its mobile
network adding on nearly 2 million new transmission stations in 2016 each cellular base station uses more than a
metric tonne of lead in standby batteries which provide emergency power

in the us ford motor companys 2016 decision to forego plans for an automotive assembly plant in mexico and
instead expand one of its michigan plants bodes well for doe run and the battery manufacturers we supply
separately the countrys largest battery producer johnson controls inc also announced it will invest 245 million
in new battery production in the us and mexico between 2016 and 2020

a promising future

lead is the most recycled metal on the planet in fact more than 99 percent of lead batteries are recycled in north
america and europe primarily as a result of the closedloop supply chain and the intrinsic value that spent lead
batteries retain their lead can be recycled and returned to its main purpose infinitely the plastic casings are also
recycled and reused as are nearly all materials used to build this highly efficient and affordable energy storage
device

but not everyone agrees that the battery of the past will meet the needs of the future other battery chemistries
using often more expensive metals such as lithium cobalt and rare earth minerals are competing to be the
preferred energy storage for electric vehicles home emergency power and other motive and stationary uses in
most cases these other battery chemistries cannot be economically recycled when they are no longer suitable for
their original use for example less than 1 percent of lithium is recycled this creates a glut of spent or partially

spent batteries primarily lithium batteries that are being stored in warehouses or refitted for other temporary uses

conversely affordable lead batteries are produced recycled and manufactured over and over again the industry is
working to advance the understanding of this quiet workhorse and help establish industry standards for battery
manufacturing and recycling so that society can use and reuse its natural resources in the most economical fashion

nextgeneration lead batteries

leads high density durability in punishing climates and untapped energy potential are some of the reasons
researchers are exploring nextgeneration leadbased batteries some of this research is taking place here in
missouri at missouri university of science and technology missouri st in rolla

missouri st is exploring the future of energy storage electric grid stability and the application of renewable
energy for a more sustainable energy future said angie rolufs director of the center for sustainability missouri
st doe run participates in and supports this research through its membership on missouri sts microgrid
consortium and its research projects including the design management and measurement of the efficacy of lead
based battery energy storage and deployment in a small multiuse campus community

around the world the advanced lead acid battery consortium alabc of which doe run is a member is
researching methods to improve lead battery performance and lifespan for microhybrid vehicles and renewable
energy storage for example recent alabc vehicle demonstrations with ford hyundai and kia have shown that
48volt lead batteries in microhybrid applications can result in fuel savings and carbon dioxide reductions of up to 16
percent advanced lead batteries are helping car manufacturers meet increasingly stringent standards for fuel
consumption and emissions around the world

the alabc and its partners plan more than 4 million in research projects with universities national laboratories
and members from across the globe during its current program period

while the outlook for lead in the long term remains strong fluctuations in metals pricing caused by social political
and economic influences are apt to continue to keep things interesting said jose hansen vice president sales and
marketing at doe run

doe runs business also is impacted by the global market for other metals found in its mines read more about the
market performance and everyday uses of zinc here

   sustainability2016doeruncom zincinthespotlight

of the three major metals contained in the ore that doe run mines  lead copper and zinc  in 2016 zinc stole the
show reaching pricing levels not seen since early 2010 because zinc is widely used in galvanized steel for
construction and the automotive industries this mineral is playing an important role in everyday life contributing to
its high market demand the year of zinc started with prices in the mid60 cents per pound range for most of
january but by midjuly the price reached 100 per pound and continued to climb throughout the year reaching its
peak at 132 per pound in late november

us zinc use has grown due to a strong performance in the automotive sector the extended period of strong
demand with diminished resources has created a dramatic decline in zinc concentrate reserves to meet global
needs global inventories of zinc concentrates have fallen from more than 11 million metric tonnes in 2014 to 02
million metric tonnes at the end of 2016

global demand significantly outpaced supply in three of four quarters of 2016 the limited supply was the result of
mine closures as well as a smelter closing in china as the country continues to address environmental impacts
and government corruption said john likarish manager of marketing at doe run as with most commodities
demand from china drove the market with analysts reporting that zinc imports to china were up 8 percent year on
year

major zinc mine closures in 2016 in australia and ireland followed the downsizing of mine operations at peru
australia and kazakhstan in late 2015 in total zinc contained in concentrates declined by 850000 metric tonnes in
2016

for the next few years we can expect to see less zinc metal availability and further increases in zinc prices and
regional premiums likarish added

zinc essential for life

as one of the most versatile minerals zinc plays an important role in infrastructure like bridges buildings and
transportation but also is essential to life as an important micronutrient for productive crops and essential dietary
mineral requirements in both humans and animals

more than 65 percent of zinc sold is used to galvanize steel used in the construction automotive and machinery
industries to prevent corrosion providing longer life to steel and the structures that depend on it

as lawmakers look at updating aging infrastructure across the us domestic zinc producers could play an important
role americans overwhelmingly support using domestically sourced minerals for infrastructure projects according to
a poll from morning consult roughly 83 percent of zinc from galvanized steel is recycled returning this valuable
metal to its varied uses

zinc is an important mineral for both plant and human health a lack of zinc in soil prevents plants from reaching
their full root and foliage potential decreasing the amount of food it can produce these deficiencies in the soil also
correlate to insufficient zinc in humans and negative health impacts for example zinc has been promoted to boost
the immune system helping people fight colds and ear infections and can be used to help treat malaria skin
conditions asthma diabetes adhd and other conditions

adequate levels of zinc reduce childhood illnesses enhance physical growth and decrease mortality in developing
nations thats why the international zinc association and its members partnered with unicef to combat global
zinc deficiencies through the nonprofit zinc saves kids initiative each year 15 million children die from diarrhea

adequate zinc can reduce the severity and occurrence of this acute disease in developing countries

programs to improve childhood health through adequate zinc consumption show tremendous progress in countries
including peru mexico and drc democratic republic of the congo health centers in peru report a 25 percent
reduction in diarrhea episodes and a 40 percent reduction in the duration and severity of diarrhea cases as a result
of providing zinc supplements to children

2 bil

people worldwide have inadequate zinc in their diet

800000

people at risk of dying each year from zinc deficiency

450000

children at risk of dying every year due to zinc deficiency

5 mil

children who die each year from diarrhea a condition that can be easily addressed with zinc supplements
