scope 3
besides scope 1 and 2 reporting and the partial reporting of three scope 3
categories in previous csr reports from 2007 until 2014 proximus has
extended the scope of its ghg reporting to include all relevant categories of
the ghg scope 3 corporate value chain standard in accordance with
the ghg protocol and bilan carbone
