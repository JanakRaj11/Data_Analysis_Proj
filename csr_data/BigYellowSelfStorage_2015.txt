            our corporate social responsibility csr policy sets out how we manage the impact of our business on society and the local
            environment to control our risks and manage our opportunities in a sustainable way
            big yellow has been classified as having a low environmental impact by the ethical investment research index series eiris because
            it is involved in support services notwithstanding this and in order to maintain an efficient and sustainable business for its stakeholders
            big yellow has continued to commit significant resources to the environmental and social aspects of its storage operations real estate
            portfolio new store developments and site acquisitions
            this year we report again on our energy use and in compliance with the companies act climate change regulation on reporting
            greenhouse gas ghg emissions for listed companies for the detailed application of our report see our basis of reporting at

         the year ended 31 march 2015 showed electricity use reduced by 308 from our 2011 peak pre 2011 electricity use was also decreased
         due to the installation of energy efficient motion sensor lighting msl and power saver fittings on older lamps from 2012 larger
         capacity 50 kwp solar panels were installed on new stores and from 2013 energy efficient led lamps were installed across the whole
         portfolio gas use is variable due to winter heating demand from flexi offices at eight of our stores this year our gas use threshold for
         reporting gas as a percentage of total energy use is just above the materiality level 5 the reductions in gas consumption were largely
         due to a milder winter in 2015 as flexioffice occupancy has been relatively constant over the years
         last year we set a programme target to reduce electricity by 12 by 2015 we have reduced electricity use by 175 from 2014

         this year big yellow acquired and now wholly owns the 12 big yellow limited partnership joint venture stores and continues to manage
         the buildings and utilities at these sites in previous years we had opted to capture their energy and carbon operational footprint and have
         voluntarily reported this in our previous annual emissions reporting a new store construction fit out at enfield was completed and we
         also acquired two additional existing stores at oxford and chester to add to our wholly owned big yellow portfolio
         the year ended 31 march 2011 is our peak energy use and carbon emission benchmark year due to a previous period of new store
         openings and increased occupancy this benchmark is the best year to present information on the most comparable basis

            controls this is designed to give a similar level of assurance to that obtained in the review of interim financial information
