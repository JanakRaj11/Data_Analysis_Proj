2015 sustainability report

  key sustainability results for the past 12 months at feduni

                                    greenhouse gas emissions ghg reduced by 10 or 2200 tonnes
                                    electricity consumption reduced by 9 a 9 saving equates to 96 years of electricity consumption
                                     for a typical household of 4 occupants
                                    gas consumption reduced by 15
                                    water consumption reduced by 11 or 10 million litres it would take a typical household of 4
                                     occupants 27 years to consume 10 million litres of water
                                    recycled waste increased by 25 tonnes an 11 improvement
                                    waste to landfill reduced by 38 tonnes an 8 improvement
                                    feduni recycled 38 of all waste up from 34 last year
                                    fuel consumption for the vehicle fleet reduced by 12 or 26700 litres
                                    spend on vline travel was consistent with 2014 at 79k
                                    paper consumption reduced by 14 or 2400 reams




greenhouse gas emissions

2015 target  reduce ghg emissions by 10 baseline 2013

result  achieved a 15 reduction since 2013

initiatives for 2016  large scale solar led light replacements and new gas heating systems

in the past 2 years feduni has invested 15 million to reduce energy and greenhouse gas emissions this investment
has achieved a 5 reduction in 2014 and a further 10 reduction in 2015 a further 1 million will be invested in 2016
that will see more solar led lighting and new heating systems installed
