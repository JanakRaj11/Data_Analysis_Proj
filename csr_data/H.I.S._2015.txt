futureoriented dwelling the smart house
in cooperation with the research office of messrs noshiro kawazoe and magori at tokyo university           s
production technology research center and housing makers we have completed a new smart house on our
premises in an effort to create a place for various experiments and inspections almost allelectric consumption
of thisfutureoriented houseis provided by natural energies such as solar and wind powers

 airconditioning in hotcold water circulating in the building
the smart house is a onestory hybridstructured house that is built of steels combined
with wood the comfortable innerroom environment of this house is created not by air
conditioners but by radiant heating with metallic panels in which hotcold water runs this
system is also used for structure body of the building
                                                                                                      exterior of the smart house
 visualization of basic functionalities
putting importance on residentscomfort of life besides the visualization of electric
energy produced by solar and wind powers we have visualized basic functionalities
needed for a house

 verification of comfort of life
various future energies such as solar and wind powers have been installed and                 there are solar panels equipped on the roof
experimented among them magneticforce power generation is an epochmaking
invention although still on an experimental stage for actual use magneticforce
power generation is a system that turns a generator using the suction power and
repulsive force of a strong permanent magnet which is really a future energy that
is totally clean and semipermanently usable

                                                                                                  adjusting room temperature with
