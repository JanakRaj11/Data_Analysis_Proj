     first phase of transition                second phase of transition

            to achieve true globalization

            akebono brake industry co ltd was founded as japans first brake
            lining friction material manufacturer in january 1929 just at the
            dawning of the countrys motorization since then we have striven to
            best serve society by doing our utmost to ensure absolute safety
            a look back at our more than 85 years of history shows that three major
            phases of transition have marked our transformation from automotive
            brake lining producer to comprehensive brake manufacturer providing
            brakes for motorcycles rolling stock and industrial machinery
                                                                                                                                billions of yen
                the first phase was marked by a technological alliance with bendix                                                        250
            corporation then a worldleading brake manufacturer based in the
            united states in 1960 when japan was on the brink of fullscale
            motorization this alliance enabled us take that significant first step
            toward becoming a comprehensive brake manufacturer the second
            phase came in 1986 when we established a joint venture in kentucky
            with general motors company the worlds leading automaker this                                                              200
            move secured our first overseas stronghold and marked the beginning
            of our global investments in 2010 we entered the third phase of
            transition as in a follow up to the acquisition of the north american
            brake business of robert bosch llc in 2009 we began tackling
            challenge of becoming a company capable of succeeding in the face of
            rapid globalization                                                                                                          150

            akebono has solidified its domestic business foundation in a manner in
            keeping with its commitment to delivering absolute safety today the

                                             q1	what is your evaluation on the governance function of akebonos board of directors
                                             a1	in every board of directors meeting discussions are very animated although they arent faultfinders outside
                                                     directors and outside audit  supervisory board members voice questions and make shrewd suggestions
                                                     whenever they have any doubt or problem regarding management proposals given this i believe that the
                                                     participation of such individuals facilitates cogent discussion which is the cornerstone of corporate governance
                                                     thereby ensuring that the boards supervisory function remains very effective i think cozy relationships
                                                     between outside members and internal directors and executive officers must be avoided in this light the
