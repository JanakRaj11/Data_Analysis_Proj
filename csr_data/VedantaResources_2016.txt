working
together
growing
together

individually one can take rapid strides but together
we can take giant leaps individually one can achieve
unidimensional growth but together we can pursue
wellrounded and sustainable development
at vedanta we believe that the outcome of working
collectively is always greater than the sum of its parts
that is why we rigorously practise the philosophy of
working together growing together
the three imperatives that govern our business approach
are conversation collaboration and creation of shared value
over the years we have been meticulously building
symbiotic relationships with our stakeholders this year
was no diﬀerent we formed publicprivate partnerships
to mount highimpact community interventions
collaborated with community to achieve greater goals
worked handinhand with our suppliers to enhance
their sustainability quotient and continued to ensure
fair value for our employees and shareholders
we synergised strengths and interwove all facets
of the triple bottom line to create a strong fabric of
inclusive growth

natural resources especially the subsoil ones play a vital role in a nations progress and prosperity but mining of these resources is a complex and intensive
process that may cause environmental and social challenges hence maintaining a ﬁne balance between economic growth and sustainability is vital
at vedanta resources we adopt global leading practices to reduce and minimise the environmental impacts of our operations reduction of water and
energy consumption minimising land disturbance and waste production containing pollution and conducting successful mine closure are some of the
measures we have undertaken to minimise our impacts




approach
we work with our partners and the neighbouring communities at project sites to bring farreaching socioeconomic and environmental beneﬁts to the
region we adopt a systematic and processoriented approach underpinned by a spirit of entrepreneurship this approach has not only resulted in
mitigating impacts but has also created value for our stakeholders and helped us secure the social licence to operate
our sustainable development framework includes a toolkit of policies standards and guidance notes to rigorously manage environmental impacts for the
environmental priorities arising from the materiality process we have developed speciﬁc objectives and targets and review performance against these
issues on a periodic basis we are working towards implementing our biodiversity action plans and are also ﬁnding new and innovative ways to reduce and
recycle waste from our operations including ﬂy ash red mud phosphorous gypsum copper slag etc

the impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be suﬃciently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental

 our sustainable development framework includes a number of technical and management standards which are aligned to international standards
 like ifc and icmm and require consultation with interested and aﬀected parties right from the earliest stages of business planning
 these sustainability standards ensure that sustainability risk assessments and due diligence appraisals are integrated into the wider due diligence
 around project development new projects and potential acquisitions including commercial nancial and legal and site closure


 new projects
 every new project poses a unique set of challenges demographics local customs cultural nuances and communication patterns  all vary from location to
 location therefore when we initiate a new project we analyse it thoroughly across all stages  from exploration to development operations and closure
 along with economic viability of a project we also conduct a socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment through a systematic process

                                                  workforce and the wider local community this support was evident not only during the life of the
                                                  mine but over the last two years intensive eﬀorts have been made to plan for post closure investment
                                                  and employment at the site by harnessing the support of local and national government

these standards that govern our actions and decisions across the project life cycle broadly focus on following aspects given below

site closure
closure is not the end of the story for the mines in fact it is the ﬁrst chapter in the long tale of recovery of the ecosystem and social renewal for communities
it is during this phase that the stakeholder gaze is intense and they expect companies to fulﬁl the social and environmental commitments which were made
at the beginning of the project

we consider mine closure as a core part of our business we plan the                    closure criteria outline closure activities establish roles and
closure right at the exploration stage and formulate a balanced realistic              responsibilities timeframes and resource requirements phased
and achievable plan that can be funded and supported by us and                         restoration and reclamation activities are carried out in consultation
generate longterm value for the environment and the community as                      with the local community we recognise the opportunity to share the
part of the plan we strive to build a sustaining economy in the                        lessons learnt and technical expertise between lisheen mine and our
surrounding region to ensure that we leave behind a positive legacy                    other operations in order to ensure full implementation of
ﬁnancially environmentally and socially                                               international good practice across all of our operations however
                                                                                        apart from lisheen mine we do not envisage any other planned mine
all our operations have site closure plans in place which are aligned with
                                                                                        closures in the near future
local legal requirements in india establishing a closure plan is a critical
step in obtaining regulatory approval from the department of                            the closure management of our lisheen mine is a testimony of our
environment and the department of mines these closure plans set out                    commitment to adhere to global best practices

 our human rights policy is aligned to the un guiding                          code of conduct ensures that all our suppliers also commit to the same
 principles on business and human rights and includes                         norms our signiﬁcant suppliers and contractors generally include
 strict prohibition of child or forced labour  either directly                wellreputed and wellgoverned organisations with systems and

requirements set out in international federation of accountants ifac code of ethics for professional accountants eys independence policies and

in order to form our conclusions we undertook the following key steps
 interviews with select key personnel and the core team responsible for the preparation of the report to understand the companys sustainability vision
  mechanism for management of sustainability issues and engagement with key stakeholders
 interactions with the key personnel at the companys head oﬃce and unitslocations in order to understand and review the current processes in place for

observations and opportunities for improvement
during the review process we observed that
 the company has compiled the report as per the in accordance core criteria of gri g4 sustainability reporting guidelines the report presents a fair
  description of the companys materiality assessment and includes performance disclosures under the aspects identiﬁed as material
 the company has demonstrated a structured approach towards data management for sustainability performance reporting in line with gri g4 guidelines
  however it may further improve on the accuracy compilation and completeness of reporting on certain indicators viz safety and human resource data
 the company may further strengthen internal review of the sustainability performance data for increasing reliability as well as auditability of the same

conclusion
on the basis of our procedures for this limited assurance nothing has come to our attention that causes us not to believe that the company has reported on
sustainability issues materially signiﬁcant to its business and its stakeholders
