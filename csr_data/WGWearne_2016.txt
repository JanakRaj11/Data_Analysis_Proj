the directors acknowledge that they are ultimately responsible for the system of internal financial
control established by the group and place considerable importance on maintaining a strong control
environment to enable the directors to meet these responsibilities the board sets standards for

risk cannot be fully eliminated the group endeavours to minimise it by ensuring that appropriate
infrastructure controls systems and ethical behaviour are applied and managed within predetermined
procedures and constraints

the directors are of the opinion based on the information and explanations given by management that
the system of internal control provides reasonable assurance that the financial records may be relied
on for the preparation of the separate and consolidated financial statements however any system of
internal financial control can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss
