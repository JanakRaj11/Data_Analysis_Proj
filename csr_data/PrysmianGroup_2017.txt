letter to stakeholders
prysmian performed well in 2016 as evidenced by an 8 rise in the economic value generated and
distributed compared with the prior year recent efforts have borne fruit across every dimension of
sustainability including reductions in the emissions of co 2 and ozonedepleting substances an increase in
the percentage of factories with health and safety certification the launch of such innovative products as the
66 kv which has been qualified for the carbon trust programmes and the issue of new policies and
procedures confirming that our fundamental values include a focus on individuals and ethics

turning to personnel management prysmian has developed a policy on human rights in order to define
objectives for the protection of those rights both within the organisation and throughout the value chain in
terms of acquiring and managing talent our recruiting programmes have achieved excellent participation
rates and the intensive training activities of the prysmian group academy  an international school for
managerial and professional training  have continued with support from the manufacturing academy
opened recently in turkey
lastly the success of the internal yes programme continues enabling group employees to purchase
prysmian shares at an advantageous price currently about 44 of employees have participated in this
programme and following authorisation to extend it for another three years this percentage is expected to
rise in the near future to as much as 15 of the entire shareholder base

as part of the dialogue with stakeholders on sustainability matters the third multistakeholder
engagement event was held recently in pikkala finland where the group has a large submarine cables
factory these initiatives have become an integral part of our sustainability strategy as they represent a
useful communications channel for defining shared objectives

with regard to sustainable innovation 2016 was a very important year the group reached a series of
technological milestones that will have an impact on the market in terms of energy saving and sustainability
key among these hvdc technology will enable large quantities of electricity to be transmitted over long
distances frequently across national borders in a world first prysmian has launched systems using 700 kv
ppl and 600 kv xlpe hvdc cables which guarantee improvements of up to 15 in network reliability
in addition we have extended our plaser technology  for the manufacture of recyclable and eco
sustainable cables  to hvdc systems by launching the plaser 600 kv the new 66 kv cable system
which allows reductions of up to 15 in the cost of offshore wind farms has also been qualified for carbon
trust programmes in the telecom area the flextube optical cable has achieved another world first by
bundling together 2112 fibres in a solution that reduces the impact of the construction work needed for each
installation

prysmian has also worked to improve performance in the environmental area in 2016 operations in 8
european countries purchased 100 of their electricity from renewable sources in addition the quantity of
ozonedepleting substances emitted at group level fell by 6

during the year the group finalised its model of governance by making the compensation and
appointments committee responsible for the supervision of sustainability matters and establishing a
sustainability steering committee composed of all function and business directors and chaired by coo
andrea pirondini to define strategies and the related activities

the group has devised a clear sustainability strategy founded on the universallyaccepted elements
agreed and documented by the united nations in its definition of 17 sustainable development goals these
should lead governments around the world to adopt more responsible practices and outcomes over the next
fifteen years the approach taken by the group seeks not only endorsement but also alignment with the
expectations and good sustainable practices of our stakeholders the same values will be spread throughout
the entire value chain

for these reasons prysmian has defined a sustainability policy that establishes the groups strategic
priorities for the mediumlong term making reference to the sustainable development goals the main
international indicators and the expectations of our stakeholders
analysis of these elements has led prysmian to select the five sustainable development goals to which we
can contribute most and to translate them into a sustainability plan consisting of priorities objectives and
actions that are consistent with our business and corporate values building on this foundation the group
has also devised a scorecard that identifies 16 sustainability targets to be met by 2020 each measured by
quantitative kpis that will be monitored closely so progress can be reported on a regular basis
this vision of sustainability in strategic terms is further demonstrated by the decision with effect from 2017
to link our sustainability objectives with the incentive systems in place for the entire management team

i am also pleased to announce the improvement of our positioning in numerous international sustainability
rankings including the authoritative dow jones sustainability index djsi the group now ranks fourth in
its own sector following an improvement in score attributable to the numerous steps taken in the
environmental social and governance fields the excellence of our sustainability management was also
                                                                                            
confirmed in the cdp climate change report 2016 and by our inclusion in the stoxx global esg index
and the carbon clean 200 list

in closing i am proud to mention the inauguration of the groups new headquarters in milan which is
expected to lower administrative costs with respect to the previous location by about 50 naturally
enough our new headquarters has taken a sustainable approach as evidenced by the project to obtain the
international leed platinum certification this sets the standard for the measurement and evaluation of
sustainable buildings considering the reduction of co 2 emissions and the quality of the materials used
during the construction phase

the groups sustainability strategy

sustainability policy and plan


sustainability plays a central role for prysmian which seeks to promote a responsible business model by
encouraging the increased integration of sustainability within the strategy adopted
operating in accordance with a philosophy founded on the values of excellence integrity and
comprehension prysmian has consolidated its economic environmental and social commitment over time
seeking to create value for all stakeholders and contributing to the sustainable development of the territories
in which the group operates
consistent with the corporate vision and values which seek to promote the efficient effective and
sustainable supply of energy and information as the main driver for the development of communities the
group took important steps over the past year to further integrate sustainability matters within its business
activities in particular prysmian defined a sustainability policy during 2016 that establishes the groups
strategic priorities for the mediumlong term making reference to the sustainable development goals
sdgs promoted by the united nations the main international indicators and the expectations of our
stakeholders
analysis of these expectations and the sustainable development goals has enabled the group to identify
the emerging trends with regard to sustainability and therefore to determine our own strategic priorities
objectives and actions for the creation of shared value specifically prysmian has selected the five
sustainable development goals to which we can contribute most and translated them into a sustainability
plan consisting of priorities objectives and actions that are consistent with our business and corporate
values
building on this foundation the group has also devised a scorecard that identifies 16 sustainability targets
to be met by 2020 each measured by quantitative kpis that will be monitored closely so progress can be
reported on a regular basis

governance of sustainability


recognising the importance of sustainability topics in the management of business processes and accepting
the invitation to formalise the approach taken to them contained in the code of corporate governance for
listed companies the board of directors has tasked the compensation and appointments committee with
supervising from 1 january 2016 the sustainability matters associated with the groups activities and the
dynamics of its interactions with all stakeholders as part of the system for the governance of sustainability a
sustainability steering committee comprising leaders from within the organisation is responsible for defining
strategies and actions for presentation to the compensation and appointments committee in particular the
steering committee is tasked with periodically discussing the strategic sustainability priorities as well as with
defining and implementing the action plans needed to reach specific targets consistent with those strategic
priorities the corporate and business communications function plays a significant role having
responsibility for mapping and monitoring the expectations of stakeholders in relation to the group
proposing guidelines and actions organising stakeholder engagement activities and drawing on the multiple
resources available guaranteeing constant and transparent communications with the stakeholders this
function also coordinates sustainability activities at corporate level including the collection of data and
information for the group sustainability report from each country and the various business functions these
functions are called on to adopt the sustainability priorities and practices promoted centrally by applying
within their daily activities the principles and rules embodied in group policies in this way by embracing the
underlying vision and values they improve their approach to corporate responsibility and their awareness of
sustainability matters



sustainability in the daily activities of the group

leadership in the supply of cables and systems for energy and telecommunications influences the groups
approach to sustainability guiding the growth strategy on such key matters as sustainable technological
innovation in the solutions offered the environmental responsibility of production processes the
management of relations with the local communities in which the group operates and attention to safety at
work and the development of personnel this focus results in great efforts to improve our skills in the areas
of customer centricity research and innovation environmental sustainability and employee development




                                                       11

                                                                 2016 sustainability report  prysmian group




always aware of the challenges posed by climate change the group seeks to develop innovative products
and services that will transform these challenges into opportunities the objective is to offer efficient and
sustainable solutions to customers which generate value while reducing the related environmental impact
turning to personnel management prysmian has developed a policy on human rights in order to define
objectives for the protection of those rights both within the organisation and throughout the value chain by
engaging with our suppliers on these matters this policy was approved in early 2017 and will be shared
within the organisation via various internal communication initiatives and throughout the value chain
the groups approach to sustainability is also evident in the relations established with our commercial
partners among the measures taken to include environmental and social criteria in the process of selecting
and qualifying suppliers prysmian has continued to assess all new suppliers using a qualification
questionnaire on their policies for the safeguarding of environmental and social matters in addition as part
of the management of metals suppliers work has continued on their mapping classification and involvement
using a selfassessment questionnaire designed to assess the main parameters affecting sustainability such
as ethics human and workers rights the environment mining activities and conflict minerals
the efforts made in relation to sustainability have also resulted in transparent and structured
communications to all group stakeholders in particular the annual publication of this sustainability report
enables all readers to analyse in depth the policies promoted and the performance achieved in economic
environmental social and product terms continuing the work carried out in prior years the 2016
sustainability report has been prepared in conformity with the sustainability reporting guidelines g4
issued in 2013 by the gri  global reporting initiative the gri g4 guidelines for sustainability reporting
require the sustainability report to contain information about matters that are considered important being
those with a significant economic environmental and social impact on the organisation and that significantly
influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders the report has also been subjected to specific
auditing procedures by a recognised external firm in order to assure all stakeholders of the reliability of the
information provided

as confirmation of the efforts made the group is still included in the ftse4good a prestigious global index
comprising firms that stand out for both their ethical and transparent management practices and the
implementation of sustainable policies seeking to ensure continuity with prior years during 2017 prysmian
will once again participate in the main assessments of sustainability organised at an international level
including in particular the robecosam assessment for the dow jones sustainability index djsi and the
questionnaire for the carbon disclosure project cdp
the following pages of the 2016 sustainability report provide a complete view of how we work and the
performance achieved on the economic environmental and social aspects considered important for the
group and its stakeholders

dialogue with stakeholders
the sustainability strategy adopted by prysmian is marked by the importance recognised to the groups
numerous stakeholders in pursuing our corporate objectives it is fundamental for prysmian to develop
forms of constant dialogue and interaction with both the internal and external stakeholders in order to
understand the various needs interests and expectations social economic professional human of all the
actors involved in particular against a background that is dynamic competitive and subject to major
changes being able to foresee changes and identify emerging trends enables the group to generate
constant and shared value added over the long term
establishing and developing trustbased relationships founded on the principles of transparency openness
and listening enables prysmian to understand the constantly changing expectations and requirements of
those stakeholders that directly or indirectly influence the activities of the group or that in turn are
influenced by us in particular these relationships represent a fundamental step in the development of
structured processes that seek to identify emerging trends and predict future changes especially in view of
the current economic scenario that is highly dynamic and competitive with a high propensity to embrace
change
the approach used by the group to communicate with stakeholders has evolved steadily over time involving
various initiatives intended to make best use of the multiple channels available
multistakeholder engagement initiatives have become an integral part of the groups growth strategy as
well as an effective communications channel these initiatives are organised in pursuit of the following
objectives
         obtain suggestions from stakeholders that might improve products and processes
         improvement the management of reputational risk
         inform educate and involve stakeholders in a manner that enables them to improve their decision
          making and actions with consequent benefits for the company and the group
         contribute to the development of relations with stakeholders based on trust and transparency
following the second multistakeholder engagement event held in february 2016 in vilanova i la geltru
barcelona spain the group organised a new event in february 2017 in pikkala finland where prysmian
has a factory this event involved 25 local representatives of seven categories of external stakeholder
customers suppliers local communities universities and research centres ngos public administrations
and environment the participants were able to play an active role in the discussions and workshops during
which they were free to express and exchange ideas opinions and views on a variety of topics related to
sustainability and corporate social responsibility this open dialogue resulted in discussion of prysmians
approach to sustainability drawing out the subject areas considered priority by the stakeholders in order to
guide the group towards new and ever broader horizons in addition during the discussions participants
made a significant contribution to identifying the main effects of group activities on the various stages of the
value chain highlighting the relevance and perceived importance of each sustainabilityrelated matter the
main matters identified were associated with the following topics technological development innovation and
ecodesign sustainability in the value chain sustainable production and consumption clean energy
sustainable infrastructure and smart cities and human rights

lastly the stakeholders discussed the sustainability challenges that the group should tackle over the long
term consistent with the sdgs that they identified as most significant for the organisation in order to
continue along the road towards sustainable development
during 2017 prysmian will continue the stakeholder involvement activities commenced last year in
particular work to remap the groups stakeholders and their expectations is under way with a view to
expanding and giving new impetus to the related activities the approach adopted is more inclusive taking
account of the sustainability indices and ratings that are routinely used by investors and commercial partners
when making investment and purchasing decisions additionally a new multistakeholder engagement
event will be organised during the year in a country in which the group is active


                                                                                      1

materiality analysis
updating the work begun in 2014 once again prysmian has carried out a materiality analysis in order to map
and classify the sustainability matters that are important for the group and its stakeholders this analysis
identified the matters considered important being those with a significant economic environmental and
social impact on the organisation and that significantly influence the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders understanding the viewpoints of stakeholders is in fact key if the group is to continue to
generate shared value over the short medium and long term
consistent with the g4 sustainability reporting guidelines defined in 2013 by the gri  global reporting
initiative and adopted for the first time when preparing the 2014 sustainability report prysmians materiality
analysis has been updated to take account of the new needs and requirements of the groups external
stakeholders identified at the multistakeholder engagement event organised in pikkala finland
the output of the analysis identified the important sustainability matters for the prysmian group which
represent a starting point for reporting on the significant aspects central to the groups commitments
analysis of these matters took account of the impact of each both within the group and beyond throughout
the entire value creation chain further information about this analysis is presented in the attachments to this
report

bribery policy and an antitrust code of conduct as part of the groups compliance policies these policies
are published on the groups website and on the corporate intranet while updates are communicated to all
group employees in addition during 2016 prysmian updated and implemented throughout the group a
whistleblowing procedure that complies with the main best practices on ethical and compliance matters
in order to support and sustain one of prysmians key values namely integrity during 2016 the group
established a compliance structure that among other activities monitors observance of the code of ethics

managing reports on alleged violations of the code of ethics socalled whistleblowing procedure this
procedure offers everyone whether employees or not the opportunity to submit reports to the group even
online and in anonymous form about improper conduct and alleged illegal activities within the organisation

the whistleblowing mechanism integrity above all
the system of values adopted by the prysmian group guides the conduct of individuals both within and
outside the firm this system is documented in the code of ethics which establishes the principles to be
followed by all and represents an effective tool for preventing irresponsible or illegal conduct by persons who
work for and in the name of prysmian prysmian has decided to take another step forward by launching the
whistleblowing mechanism at group level this tool which enables stakeholders to report any improper
practices is intended to disseminate further the principles and practice of ethical conduct the mechanism is
consistent with the best practices relating to ethics and compliance given that whistleblowing procedures
based on anonymous reporting have been shown to be the most effective way to identify fraud and
improprieties an independent third party the network inc manages the whistleblowing channels and
ensures their security with a strict mandate to protect the identity of whistleblowers and to act as
intermediary for the transmission of questions and followup replies as well as to communicate information
about the outcome of each case the group has also established a specific whistleblowing committee
which will assess all reports carefully carry out investigations and if appropriate take the necessary action

governance
effective and efficient to create sustainable value over time and give rise to a virtuous spiral centred
on business integrity
prysmian is aware of the importance of a good system of corporate governance for achieving the groups
strategic objectives and creating sustainable value over the long term the system must ensure that
governance is effective with respect for the institutions and the rules efficient with respect for the principles
of cost saving and proper in relation to all parties involved in the life of the group
with a view to sparking this virtuous spiral the group strives to ensure that the system of governance is
aligned constantly with the relevant recommendations and regulations and complies with domestic and
international best practices in addition the group has adopted principles rules and procedures that govern
and guide the activities of all organisational and operational units as well as guarantee that all operations
are carried out in an effective and transparent manner
with a view to constantly improving the system of corporate governance prysmian took various additional
                                                                                                                        2
steps during 2016 to implement the recommendations contained in the code of corporate governance for
listed companies adopted by the group and strengthen the principles of transparency and integrity applied
the structure of corporate governance within the group is founded on the core role of the board of directors
 as the most senior body appointed to manage the company in the interests of shareholders  in providing
strategic direction guaranteeing the transparency of decisionmaking processes and establishing an
effective system of internal controls and risk management that encompasses the decisions made with
internal andor external effects the board of directors exercises the widest powers of ordinary and
extraordinary administration except for those that by law are reserved solely for the shareholders meeting
consistent with the recommendations of the code of selfregulation the number and standing of the non
executive directors ensures that their opinions carry significant weight in the adoption of board resolutions
the traditional model of governance and control adopted by prysmian involves the presence of a
shareholders meeting a board of directors and a board of statutory auditors
in compliance with art 14 of the articles of association the company is administered by a board of directors
comprising eleven directors  in office until the date of the shareholders meeting called to approve the
financial statements for the year ending on 31 december 2017  of which seven are nonexecutive directors
among all the directors eight are men and three are women four are aged between 30 and 50 and seven
are over 50 years of age six of the nonexecutive directors are also deemed to be independent pursuant to
art 148 para 3 of decree 58 dated 24 february 1998 tuf  consolidated finance law and application
criteria 3c1 and 3c2 of the code of selfregulation while one nonexecutive director is considered
independent pursuant to art 148 para 3 tuf the board of directors has identified from among its
members a chief executive officer and general manager granting him all powers of ordinary administration
that may be necessary or useful for the conduct of the business the directors are responsible for managing
the firm and carry out the operations necessary in order to achieve the corporate objects the board of
directors is also responsible for the groups system of internal control and risk management and
accordingly must check its adequacy and adopt specific guidelines specified by that system the board is

antitrust regulations
competition law on restrictive practices and the abuse of dominant positions now plays a central role in
governing the activities of firms operating in all sectors of economic life prysmians strong international
presence in more than 50 countries subjects the group to the competition regulations in force in europe and
in all other countries in which we operate each of these is more or less demanding in terms of the civil
administrative responsibilities and criminal penalties imposed for violation of the applicable laws over the
past decade the various local antitrust authorities have dedicated increasing attention to the business
activities of market players and furthermore have showed a greater propensity for international
collaboration amongst themselves prysmian intends to operate in the marketplace in compliance with the
rules in place to protect competition
consistent with the priorities defined in the erm process the board of directors has adopted an antitrust
code of conduct that all directors executives and employees of the group are expected to know and
comply with in the performance of their duties and in relations with third parties in addition during 2017
prysmian has introduced an antitrust training programme designed to increase awareness among those
who work in the name and on behalf of the group so that during their activities they comply with the rules
safeguarding competition the antitrust code of conduct which is an integral part of this training programme
seeks to describe the issues relating to the application of italian and eu competition policy with regard to
cartels and the abuse of dominant positions the specific situations arising must be assessed against this
framework on a casebycase basis this action stimulating knowledge and making individuals more aware
of their professional duties and responsibilities represents a further step in establishing an antitrust culture
within the group


at the end of january 2009 the european commission launched an investigation into the various european
and asian manufacturers of electrical cables in order to check the existence of alleged anticompetitive

and systematic tool that supports the main decisionmaking processes this enterprise risk management
erm model developed in line with internationally recognised models and best practices allows the board
of directors and management to evaluate in an informed manner those risk scenarios that might compromise
the achievement of strategic objectives and to adopt tools that are able to foresee mitigate or manage
significant exposures
the groups chief risk officer cro appointed to govern the erm process is responsible for
guaranteeing together with management that the main risks faced by prysmian and its subsidiaries are
identified assessed and monitored on a timely basis in addition an internal risk management committee
comprising senior managers ensures via the cro that the erm process remains dynamic to reflect
changes in the business requirements and events affecting the group over time the cro reports
periodically at least twice each year to senior management on these changes
the erm model adopted formalised in the group erm policy that incorporates the guidelines for the
system of internal control and risk management approved in turn by the board of directors back in 2014
follows a topdown approach ie based on direction from senior management and the mediumlongterm
strategies and objectives of the business this extends to all types of riskopportunity that are potentially
significant for the group these are shown in the risk model  presented below  which groups the areas of
internal and external risk into five families that characterise prysmians business model
       strategic risks risks deriving from internal and external factors such as changes in market
        conditions business decisions that are wrong andor implemented improperly and slow reactions to
        changes in the competitive environment that might threaten the groups competitive position and the
        achievement of its strategic objectives
       financial risks risks associated with the availability or sources of finance or the ability to manage
        efficiently the volatility of exchange and interest rates
       operational risks risks deriving from events or situations that limit the effectiveness and efficiency
        of key processes affecting the ability of the group to create value
       legal and compliance risks risks connected with violations of national international and sector
        regulations or professionally improper behaviour that does not comply with the code of ethics which
        expose the group to possible penalties and damage its reputation in the marketplace

                                  risk model adopted by the prysmian group




managers involved in the erm process are required to use a clearly defined common methodology to
measure and evaluate specific risk events in terms of impact  probability of occurrence and the adequacy
of the system of controls in place erm is a continuous process that contributes as defined in the erm
policy to the determination of the groups threeyear business and strategic plan by identifying possible
events that could influence the sustainability of the plan which is updated annually with the involvement of
all key managers
during 2016 the erm process involved the groups main businessfunction managers resulting in
identification and assessment of the main risk factors that are summarised below together with the
mitigation strategies adopted


sustainability risks
the group constantly reviews its approach to the management of risks consistent with this and aware of
the important opportunities deriving from the efficient management of sustainability risks as well as the
growing attention paid by regulators and stakeholders prysmian has decided to adopt a more holistic
approach by identifying for each area the risks deriving from the environmental social and economic impact
of its activities

organisational model decree 2312001
prysmian adopted an organisational model the model in compliance with the requirements of decree
2312001 on 24 january 2006 this model is periodically revised and updated to take account of changes in
the list of administrative offences and crimes envisaged by the decree as well as the dynamics of the
system of corporate governance and the organisational structure of the group this activity ensures that the
model is always up to date and applicable over time the company is and has always been determined to
comply with the related legislative requirements to implement the principles of proper management laid
down in the decree and to improve systematically the system of corporate governance in order to combine
the achievement of excellent results with full compliance with the regulations and the highest ethical
standards
the model which is an integral part of the groups broader system of governance is designed to establish
operational rules of behaviour that are suitable for preventing illicit conduct deemed significant by the
company pursuant to the decree based on analyses of prysmians business activities decisionmaking
processes and system of internal control
the model comprises two sections the first part of a general nature describes the decree the rules of
governance and the general principles on which the model is based
            code of ethics which sets out the key principles of ethical behaviour that must be observed by all
             those who work on behalf of prysmian or its affiliates translated into 26 languages the code of
             ethics is displayed at each group affiliate and periodic training sessions are held for employees and
             collaborators
            guidelines for conduct that by analysing the key principles expressed in the code of ethics identify
             required behaviours in the areas of what to do and what not to do thus responding to the need to
             prevent possible offence risk scenarios
the second section on the other hand seeks to identify and govern the specific conduct required in areas
that are known to expose the company to offence risk situations
the fundamental principles laid down in the code of ethics and the guidelines for conduct are rendered
operational by the definition of specific decision management and control protocols that govern for each
process exposed to offence risk the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved the decision
makingauthorisation procedures and the management and control methodologies adopted
lastly the governance rules for the model specify the organisational rules for implementation ensuring the
continuous functioning of the model

internal audit compliance and internal control
in order to strengthen the system of internal control and risk management commencing from 28 july 2016
the board of directors established a compliance function and acting on a recommendation from the
director responsible for the system of internal control and risk management approved by the audit
committee and having consulted the board of statutory auditors appointed a compliance and internal audit
officer to manage the new compliance department as well as the internal audit department as a
consequence the compliance and internal audit officer was granted the rights and duties envisaged in the
code of selfregulation for the managers of internal audit functions the group decided to maintain a
separate internal audit organisation which now reports hierarchically and functionally to the compliance and
internal audit officer including the compliance function the internal audit function has now become larger
and more structured
the compliance and internal audit officer reports hierarchically to the board of directors who appointed him
while also reporting on his work to the audit committee and the board of statutory auditors this person is
not responsible for any operational areas despite having direct access to all the information needed for the
performance of his functions
the compliance and internal audit officer is mandated to check the adequacy and functioning of the system
of internal control and risk management in compliance with international professional standards both on an
ongoing basis and with regard to specific requirements accordingly he prepares an annual audit and
compliance plan for the group based on the risk assessment carried out as part of the erm process

integrated sustainability

group approach
prysmian strives to find technologically advanced solutions and to develop efficient products that
are both cuttingedge and sustainable in order to meet and satisfy the expectations of customers

the prysmian group has consolidated its leadership position in the design development production supply
and installation of terrestrial and submarine cables and systems for the transmission of electricity special
cables for applications in various industrial segments medium and low voltage cables for buildings and
infrastructure and cables and accessories for the transmission of voice video and data
quality an ability to innovate and high valueadded solutions mark prysmians strategic approach in every
sector whether those in which technology is a differentiating factor or those that are more standardised
such as medium and low voltage cables
the constant development and improvement of power and information networks are key to achieving the
groups objectives of supplying electricity efficiently and effectively and improving the level of worldwide
telecommunications modern reliable ecosustainable and efficient electricity grids and telecommunications
networks are both critical and strategic for the growth of the global economy
via its products prysmian supplies electricity and lighting to cities enabled people to move around and
communicate with each other and contributes to the steady industrial development of the sectors in which
we operate
prysmian products are central to the concept of sustainability they are used in the construction of major
wind and solar farms of infrastructure that accelerates the flow of information and communications between
communities throughout the world while reducing energy losses and of terrestrial and submarine electricity
links that improve the efficiency of the entire electrical power network our product responsibility is
considered throughout the entire life cycle of each product from design to delivery by constantly monitoring
performance against specific standards
for this reason the group strives constantly to develop innovative and technologically advanced solutions
that strengthen our leadership and meet the requirements of our commercial partners and end users the
groups growth strategy is founded on our ability to innovate and therefore promote the improvement of the
entire sector via the development of leadingedge products
the prysmian group is strongly oriented towards the creation of value for all stakeholders daily activities
principally draw inspiration from the concepts of
       customer centricity being the ability to foresee and satisfy customer requirements via the offer of
        innovative products and cabling systems on a solutiondriven basis for this reason the group
        tirelessly seeks improvement in the areas of rd employee development and environmental
        sustainability
       value creation for shareholders in terms of return on investment and profitability in the short term
        and above all in the medium and long term

customer centricity
over the years the prysmian group has perfected its approach to the market by placing the customer at the
centre of every strategic organisational and business decision the efforts made to analyse the expectations
of customers and how these change over time in fact allow the group to develop organisational and
operational models that translate into rapid efficient and targeted responses to the markets concerned
pivotal to this approach is our customer centricity being the ability to understand early and satisfy the
needs of the customer this calls for the dedication of constant attention at all stages from product design to
delivery with performance measured against predetermined and agreed parameters
the prysmian group is able to develop solutions that meet specific standards responding the precise
requirements of an individual customer
in particular the group is able to serve highly diverse segments and markets due to an ad hoc matrix
organisational structure this means that highly specific local markets are served by country development
and commercial organisations while markets with global products and customers are served by fully
integrated business units other segments requiring both a local presence and cooperation between
countries benefit from the matrix structure
customer centricity and satisfaction underpin a strategy that is implemented via the fast smooth
organisation of the entire supply chain this approach accelerates decisions and the time to market while
adapting to the needs of various industries and ensuring continuous investment in innovation
factory reliability is one way to implement customer centricity this process improves the reliability of
production planning and performance in terms of both mix and volume with ever faster response times and
stricter control over inventory levels of every type raw materials semifinished items and finished products
this enables the group to deal efficiently and effectively with fluctuating sales volumes and the consequent
changes in production levels
in addition to the customer centricity and factory reliability initiatives the prysmian group has also
launched supply chain integration projects together with a number of major global customers the
objective is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of all processes throughout the supply chain from the
producers of the raw materials and semifinished products used in factories to the end users of our cables
in the context of customer satisfaction prysmian seeks to become the partner of choice given this the
group works with customers using essentially two main tools specific surveys and oneonone interviews
since 2005 the group has commissioned specific surveys to measure the level of customer satisfaction in
the past these surveys were carried out by a market research agency and used standardised questionnaires
that were completed by telephone interviews cati methodology with the managers of prysmians main
customers in the purchasing logistics and technical sectors the surveys were carried out every two years
most recently in 20142015 and over the years involved 900 customers in the trade  installers sector in
15 countries the scores ranged from 1 to 10 and the areas covered were sales services product and
marketing
in view of the growing digital sophistication of customers from 2016 prysmian decided to introduce a new
system capable of conducting specific interviews and collecting the data provided via a web portal dedicated
to surveys which is administered directly by the central customer centricity office using this new and more

powerful tool the group expects to increase the quality of interviews the opportunities for customer contact
and most importantly the openness of the interactions between prysmian and its customers the new tool
will make it possible to improve our followup and problemsolving capabilities while also increasing the
satisfaction of customers with their partnerships with prysmian in addition this more electronic approach will
make it possible for those group divisions that have already developed a crm tool to manage directly the
interview feedback taking specific action as necessary and monitoring developments in order to ensure that
their customers receive the best treatment
the new web interviews will commence during the first four months of 2017 principally involving customers
in the ti sector in particular two pilot projects will be launched south america and spain and then
followed during the year by the addition of other countries the scores will range from 1 to 5 in order to
simplify and accelerate the activities requested of customers the questionnaires will cover the following
areas commercial conditions products and services offered customer support brand awareness product
range net promoter score and effort score
in addition to these surveys customer centricity has also been developed from 2015 via specific interviews
with customers the objective of the group is to strengthen its relations with end users holding specific
interviews that are customised depending on the customer the business unit and the geographical area
concerned this approach is managed directly from prysmians headquarters thus enabling the group to
increase its commitment to each customer regardless of the countries in which they are located over the
years these oneonone interviews have given very positive results as the persons involved have
appreciated the opportunity to share their ideas and feedback directly with the groups headquarters the
interviews cover the following areas conditions of sale product range servicedelivery documentation
customer support brandrelationship net promoter score and effort score as well as more specific questions
the oneonone interviews will continue in parallel with the new web portal for the annual online surveys
involving the main customers in specific business and geographical areas
following the oneonone interviews carried out in china and hong kong during 2015 in 2016 the group
selected eight major customers in the ti and utility business sectors in north america the results were
positive especially in the united states where the overall score from a distributor was 8710 rising to 910
from the utility customers in particular the interview with the distributor identified as areas for improvement
the pricequality ratio and variety with the product range score of 710 on the other hand the scores
obtained from the utility customers were never less than 810 in any area
with regard to the interviews held in canada the group obtained an overall score from one distributor of
6810 and scores of 6510 and 710 from other distributors in particular the new areas for improvement
identified were the ability to track information about the various orders placed the accessibility of the contact
centers the delivery process and customer support lastly the results obtained from utility customers were
higher overall reaching 7410 and 8710
based on the results of these interviews the north american organisation decided to take specific action
during 2016 and 2017 the prysmian headquarters in milan is providing support to north america

on time delivery
prysmian has confirmed our strong orientation to continuous improvement in the punctuality and reliability of
our processes as shown in the chart below the measurement of ontime delivery otd being the ability
to serve customers by respecting the delivery date promised on confirmation of the order received highlights
further improvement by the energy products segment and the stability of the telecom segment despite a
strong upturn in volume
in addition to the improvement in ontime deliveries in absolute terms the number of units performing below
the 90 threshold decreased further in 2016 thus ensuring greater uniformity in the service provided by the
groups factories


the projects designed to reduce time to market were completed during the year the fast order entry
project has slashed by 90 the time taken to input and process orders by sales customer care optimising
product searches and inventory availability as well as the ability to input many order items at the same time
with just one operation

operations
the prysmian groups manufacturing operations are highly decentralised with 82 factories in 30 countries
this enables us to react in good time to the various requests received from world markets once again
during 2016 the group continued to implement an industrial strategy based on the following factors
       manufacture of higher valueadded products with greater technological content at a limited number
        of factories which thus become centres of excellence with outstanding technological skills this
        ensures the generation of significant economies of scale with a consequent increase in production
        efficiency while reducing capital invested
       constant search for greater manufacturing efficiency in the commodities sector while maintaining at
        the same time a welldiversified territorial presence in order to minimise distribution costs
gross capital investment amounted to euro 233 million in 2016 following an increase with respect to the
prior year euro 210 million in addition to the usual investment in submarine cables and fibre optics the
largest block of expenditure reflected the priority given to the reduction of our industrial footprint and
continuation of the work on the new headquarters in milan
in particular the drive to downsize manufacturing was reflected in further efforts to rationalise the groups
production capacity in this context the factories in brondby denmark angy and neuf prè france
amsterdam e delfzijl netherlands and quilmes argentina were closed during 2016 the related
production volume was reassigned to other factories within the group this concentration of production was
carried out to optimise the cost structure and guarantee the appropriate saturation of plant capacity in each
country analysing capital investment in more detail it is important to note that the work dedicated to
increasing production capacity and to changes in mix was very significant representing 40 of the total
in the energy projects sector we have almost completed the investment to increase the capacity of the
groups two main factories dedicated to submarine cables arco felice italy and pikkala finland this
investment became necessary on the signature of the 50 hertz contract in 2014 this contract worth more
than 700 million euro involves the design supply and installation of high voltage submarine cable systems
between offshore wind farms situated in german waters at the same time work is well advanced at pikkala
on the completion of a new vertical extrusion line needed for the manufacture of the cobra cable which
will be supplied for the undersea link between denmark and the netherlands lastly improvement work that
began in 2015 has been completed on the ulisse a new cablelaying ship as a result the group now has
a third vessel dedicated to installation services alongside the giulio verne and the cable enterprise
with regard to the high voltage business a longterm plan to upgrade the capacity to test cables has been
launched in various geographical areas north america northern and southern europe in order to ensure
the full verticalisation of the manufacturing process for all cable produced by the group including those in
the highest voltage class
lastly towards the end of the year the group commenced procedures for the purchase of certain assets
from the factory in yixing china that was previously operated by shenhuan cable technologies the
machines at this facility which produces hv cables include two vertical extrusion lines
considering the investments made around the world the energy products sector benefited from major
efforts to satisfy the increasing demand from various valueadded sectors investment in suzhou and tianjin

china has increased the production capacity of trade  installer rolling stock and elevator cables a
catenary line for medium voltage cables has been installed in north america at prescott ontario canada
with reference to the european market a catenary line has been installed at pikkala finland while the
capacity to manufacture fireresistant cables has been expanded at bishopstoke england the capacity to
produce elevator cables has been increased at velke mezirici czech republic and work on the production
of rubber cables for the central european market has commenced at kistelek hungary
in addition from this year the prysmian group is consolidating the investments made at oman cables
industry after having acquired majority ownership last year these investments principally focus on low and
medium voltage cables which are used by local utilities as well as the major epc engineering procurement
and construction companies active in the arabian peninsula
with regard to the telecom business major investment in the optical fibre factory at sorocaba brazil has
been completed this was necessary in order to verticalise production for the south american market 
especially brazil in the same sector a vertical plant has also been installed at claremont usa while
increasing drawing capacity at the same time in order to satisfy the demand for fibre needed for the
production of optical cables
lastly the group has decided to invest in the optical cables factory in lexington usa where the capacity
to produce ribbon cable has been expanded
about 30 of total investment was allocated to achieving efficiency improvements and reductions in fixed
and variable costs mainly product design and material usage in addition to the rationalisation of production
capacity already described prysmian has worked hard to optimise production costs throughout the entire
telecom business segment this was made possible by the construction of two new factories in eastern
europe the first in slatina romania for the production of optical cables used in telecommunications and
the second in presov slovak republic for the production of optical cables for multimedia applications at
the latter location the current capacity to manufacture copper cables has also been expanded these two
new factories confirm the groups interest in creating two centres of excellence in europe for these types of
cable with the same objective in mind work has begun on a factory at durango mexico for the production
of optical cables used in telecommunications in order to satisfy the growing demand from north and central
america
in addition investment to enhance efficiency has continued at the european factories for the production of
optical fibre in battipaglia italy and douvrin france with a view to reducing fibre manufacturing costs
significantly while focusing particular attention on increasing the size of preforms lastly work is well

sustainable innovation
commitment to innovation
being a leader means knowing how to innovate the prysmian group seeks to generate innovation
quality and knowhow with a view to developing innovative products and systems with a lower
environmental impact and higher value added for customers even in those sectors in which
products are largely standardised

the groups commitment to innovation and the development of new products with a reduced environmental
impact stems from the conviction that this is the best way to guarantee economic sustainability over the long
term such a commitment is essential in order to assure wellbeing and the quality of life in todays society
and for future generations in particular development projects seek to increase the efficiency and reliability
of the finished products offered by prysmian while at the same time lowering energy and power losses as
well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of electricity and water during the
production processes
sustainability is a constant focus for the prysmian group in step with the times and the markets it is not
only a prerogative for research development and innovation in the more developed countries but also for
that performed in the emerging countries investment in sustainability helps in fact to lower risk in places
where energy costs are rising and access to energy sources remains unstable in addition the groups
engineers employ advanced tools to validate the performance of our cables and simulate applications even
before any prototypes are made this process helps to maximise the use of laboratory time for example by
avoiding unnecessary repetitions and therefore reduce the consumption of materials and energy
spending by prysmian on research development and innovation during 2016 totalled about 83 million
        10
euro  confirming our constant commitment and focus on sustainable growth over the long term
work dedicated to the optimisation of costs via the designtocost dtc programme has also continued
this methodology is used to lower production costs both when developing a new product and when re
engineering an existing product this programme achieved cost savings totalling almost 17 million euro in
2016 more than 1100 projects have benefited from this programme
the groups constant drive to innovate is also supported by 17 centres of excellence which have their
headquarters in milan and employ more than 550 experienced professionals

main projects
prysmian developed numerous rd projects during the year the most significant are presented in
this section

energy
submarine cables
the year saw completion of the typeapproval process and a good part of the production of the 50 hz 220 kv
                        2
cable with 1200 mm copper conductors in addition a new design of unipolar cable with optical elements
incorporated in the sheathing was installed and entered into service as part of the undersea project in the
philippines
the group has continued work on new splicing techniques linked to the diameter of the conductors making
it possible to join large aluminium conductors and splice conductors with different sections and made of
different metals for both 320 kvdc and 220 kvac systems the development work includes testing and
longterm trials that will be completed in the coming years
with regard to the development of systems for installations at great depth the prototype with optimised
double sheathing has been completed and tested internally confirming the feasibility of installations at
depths of up to 3000 metres
in addition to the work on mi mass impregnated cables intended to improve the recovery plan for the
westernlink project the first phase of research has been completed into alternative materials and
optimisation of the design and production process obtaining internal qualification at 700 kv
with regard to the project for 600 kvdc extruded cables the first positive results have been confirmed for
application of the xlpe and plaser technologies in particular feasibility studies have been carried out for
the development of long distance ehvac submarine systems up to 200 km as well as for the monitoring
partial discharges of long distance ehvac or dc submarine systems using the prycam gate technology
lastly the project for the implementation and industrialisation of leadless submarine systems with welded
copper sheathing has been approved and launched at the pikkala factory in finland the industrialisation
work will be completed by the end of 2017


terrestrial cables
with regard to the product development of ehv terrestrial cables the development and type tests have
been completed on the new 600 kv hvdc system with extruded sheathing as certified in accordance with
the cigre tb496 specifications this important result is a milestone in the cable transmission of power
enabling the transportation using a single bipole of power in excess of 26 gw the knowhow of the
prysmian group in terms of materials technology and electrical testing was decisive in achieving this
result hvdc systems are preferred for high power transmissions via insulated cables over long distances
in terms of ehv product development three prototype cables with extruded insulation have been produced
with milliken conductors comprising 2500 and 3500 mm² section copper with aluminium sheathing welded
longitudinally the two 2500 mm² prototypes have been insulated with alternative materials with respect to
those currently used

ti trade and installers
with regard to the ti business rd has focused on three key topics safety sustainability and new
product indicators
on the subject of safety the entry into force of en 50575 a harmonised european standard on 10 june
2016 was an important change there will be a one year transition period before this standard becomes
compulsory throughout the european union on 1 july 2017 during this period it will be possible to launch
old products compliant with current national legislation as well as new products compliant with the new eu
directive nevertheless only the latter will be authorised for sale from 1 july 2017 onwards as a
consequence all affiliates of the prysmian group operating in the european countries covered by the new
legislation are making a major effort to align the characteristics of their product portfolios cables for
permanent installation in closed environments with the performance categories adopted by each country
this development activity is accompanied by intensive certification work given that the new standard
establishes very rigorous criteria for the testing and type approval of the cables concerned in this regard
the results achieved during 2016 mean that we can view with optimism the 1 july 2017 deadline when the
cpr construction product regulation comes into force in eu countries


oil  gas
this year the og sector focused on two main aspects the first related to the development of solutions
designed to increase the safety of cables used in gas formerly lng projects one of the most significant
efforts made involved the assessment and improvement of seals against the passage of gas via cables
connecting areas at risk of explosion with those at lower risk or the exterior consistent with the vision of the
prysmian group this project seeks to offer customers support in assessing the effects of cables and
complete systems and not just technical solutions
the other area of focus for development activities related to electrical submersible pumps esp the
prysmian group is currently developing a new generation of products that will have a vast range of
applications for operating conditions that are more or less challenging with accelerated testing procedures
on fullscale samples as well as hybrid solutions for downhole technology that cope with high temperatures
and are highly resistant to corrosion which is a new concept in this sector of the market


oems
with regard to cables for special oem original equipment manufacturer applications the breadth of the
product portfolio and the number of live applications has resulted in a substantial number of development
projects dedicated to various markets and customers the main efforts are concentrated on the application
of methodologies for extreme climates  such as in the arctic  and for the north american australian and
chinese markets


development and transfer of technology
in terms of development and technological improvement the project to optimise conductors for medium and
high voltages has continued with a view to reducing the weight and diameter of cables while complying with


                                                       61

                                                                  2016 sustainability report  prysmian group


the regulatory specifications for resistance under direct current work this year has focused on aluminium
given the 2016 production mix weight savings of around 115 have been achieved and work to rationalise
the grades of aluminium used has been completed resulting in a shift from 16 to 12 and therefore savings
for the purchase and management of raw materials


monitoring systems
with regard to the prycam technology work on the development of prycam gate was completed during
2016 this new patented technology can automatically measure the time interval between two partial
discharges and therefore establish with absolute certainty if an accessory or a stretch of cable is affected
by partial discharges without having employ any kind of expertise or ai algorithms prycam cable is a
second important innovation at an advance stage of development this hybrid cable used exclusively for
sensing is consider to be the embryo of the next generation of integrated monitoring systems which is
currently under development for presentation in 2017


telecom
optical fibre
in terms of the optical fibre sector 2016 saw further improvements in the process of manufacturing fibres at
the factories in the usa and brazil where an autonomous production process is now operational
numerous group factories have been equipped to produce bendbrightxs bbxs fibres which perform
better than competitive products in the presence of micro and macro bends the bending performance of this
fibre even at low diameters means that it can be used in the manufacture of smaller cables for various
layers of ftth fiber to the home networks
with regard to multimode fibres adoption of the om5 standard from september confirms the leadership of
the group in this sector too in particular this fibre is able to transmit 4 channels at 25 gbits or even 50
gbits at wavelengths of between 850 nm and 950 nm
another important innovation benefits from the few mode technology in single mode fibres information is
coded and sent in association with a single mode of transmission while in few mode fibres it is associated
with a few modes of transmission a number of preliminary tests conducted together with various partners
were successful in the transmission of data 100 gbits systems with 10 gbits signals transmitted at 1310
nm in each mode and in the field of access networks


optical cables
group activities in the optical cables field principally involved three types of product firstly flextube cables
have shown their suitability for many markets and their production has been extended to multiple factories a
version for aerial cables adss operating under adverse environmental conditions has also been
industrialised cables with 2112 fibres have been developed and installed successfully while work
continues with a view to obtaining cables with 4000 fibres
development activity on the multiloose family of cables has mainly focused on reducing their diameter in
order to maximise the number of fibres that can be blown into the dedicated underground conduits in these
cases the high level of stress to which the fibres are subjected requires them to perform particularly well

lastly the range of ribbon cables has been extended by adding 864 fibre and 1728 fibre products ul riser
rated indooroutdoor cables which lower cost and complexity within hyper scale data centers our dry
cable technology has also been certified for highly saline environments


accessories and connectivity
with regard to connectivity prysmian has continued to develop new accessories for the use of ftth ultra
broadband access networks the group has focused on the cabinets with the development of optical
distribution racks switches joint boxes for the splicing of cables and termination solutions for customers
with wallmounted boxes a series of new components has been designed to supplement the range of
multifunction joint boxes compact joint  cmj medium joint  mmj and lmj and make them suitable for
global markets in addition a new range of termination caps has been developed specifically for the french
market and industrialised at the menzel plant tunisia
the connectivity products currently under development include the pbo solution designed to simplify
externally protected connectors roe16 and roe32 optical distributor termination boxes for the italian
market a new modular subrack system srs increasing jointtermination capacity from 48 to 144 fibres in
the same space 1u that should become available in may 2017 and the design of plastic versions of the
modular racks currently made from metal for the french market


opgw special and submarine optical cables
efforts with regard to opgw cables have concentrated on developing the portfolio of steel tubes in the high
fibre content segment both central tube structures 1x96fo and multiloose structures a number of steel
tubes for opgw applications have also been developed and qualified
with regard to the transfer of technology the production of alpaalpam and sheathed submarine cables
has been moved from delfzijl to vilanova


multimedia and data centre solutions
improvements were made during 2016 in the solutions based on the discontinuous metallic ribbon in
category 6a uutp cables for cabling structured using copper cables
in addition there have been interesting developments in the remotepowering technology in particular
power over ethernet poe technology has been incorporated in a family of cables optimised for
connections over longer distances than is standard for cat 7 cables that supply both power and data in
order to connect such devices as wireless access points and security cameras a complete family of optical
cables based on flextube technology has been developed for the cabling of buildings
there were further developments with regard to data centres during 2016 working together with an
industrial partner the first fully cat 82 connection has been qualified and is now available on the market
this product allows transmission at 40 gbits over a 30m copper channel
high speed 40100 gbs cables using mm fibre have also been developed and are available in two
versions plenumriser and low emission of toxic fumes and gases

lastly the group is making a major effort to adopt the eu construction product regulation cpr most of
our existing products will be classified in accordance with the new fire resistance classes but development
work is in progress in order to achieve the more advanced categories


industrial innovations
prysmian is strengthening the exploratory studies into materials in view of the strategic role they play in the
technologies employed by cables and accessories the main results achieved during 2016 include
   laboratory production of joints with variable resistance compounds confirming the good performance
    of the materials studied as a result fullsize joints have been made for electricity testing in a circuit
   production of new compounds with high electric permittivity for both joints and terminals enabling new
    accessories to be qualified in the 36 kv class
   the group is considering the use of grafene and nanotubes in polyethylene sheathing in order to
    improve respectively its impermeability to water and its conductivity a further area of research into
    nanotubes relates to their possible use in low voltage insulation in order to determine if they might help
    inhibit the propagation of flames
   studies are currently under way into substances that absorb water without subsequently releasing it
    which might provide solutions capable of replacing the metal insulation used in the groups products
   experimental work continues on the light sheathing of submarine cables with a view to optimising the
    designs for new cable structures in addition prysmian is working with an external supplier on the joint
    development of a new traction element
   a special type of polymer that absorbs methane has been identified and synthesised the method for
    assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of absorption at ambient temperature and at 70c has also
    been optimised the group is moving on to industrial trials in a bid to confirm the good performance
    found in the laboratory
   a number of analytical techniques have been defined in order to improve our understanding of the
    behaviour of cable materials content of the ashes of materials for fireresistant cables impermeability
    of paper and ppl at various temperatures simulation of the jacketing and impregnation of insulation
    with ppl efficiency of water absorption of swellable tapes
   the study of polymers resistant to oils considering both thermoplastic and crosslinked materials is still
    in progress this study is supported by the development of a new method of crosslinking using a
    process similar to that of silanes but with improved crosslinking density
   the new afumex compounds for high levels of cpr classification have been industrialised and
    commercialised confirming the high levels of fire resistance expected
   prototype cables have been made in australia the united kingdom and italy with enamelling
    compounds that have intriguing fireresistant properties experimental work on this product will continue
    during 2017
   based on a system of tests devised and carried out by the group it has been shown that aluminium
    coating is more resistant to corrosion than zinc in aggressive environments being the combined
    presence of salt water h2s and co2

   the use of tetrazoles to inhibit the corrosion of aluminium has been shown to be a valid alternative to
    the current methods at least 200g are being synthesised for an industrial trial in addition we are
    studying suitable methods for applying these inhibitors to aluminium wire


rationalisation and management of materials
   work on the approval of alternative materials especially those of major technical or commercial
    importance is continuing throughout the group in order to eliminate monopoly suppliers
   work to rationalise the raw material codes for cables has been completed
   software has been written that will make the specifications of raw materials available at the time that
    the material code is activated this software will supply all the specifications to prysmian in a unified
    database that can be searched
   software for cataloguing the technical sheets of compounds has been written and is now being
    implemented


thoughts about the environment
the rd activities of the prysmian group dedicate great attention to the social and environmental aspects
seeking to use materials that do not represent a hazard for human health or the environment efforts include
performing upfront analyses of the data for materials in order to check their possible impact on the
environment and the group during the year the group therefore developed initiatives and projects
designed to reduce the environmental impact of the product range
in order to increase the efficiency and reliability of finished products while at the same time lowering the
dissipation of energy and power prysmian has worked to reduce the setup times of the machines used and
increase the speed with which products are manufactured as a result of introducing these innovations the
group has achieved greater manufacturing efficiency increase the volume produced per unit of time and
consequently reducing the energy consumed per unit of production
additionally all hv projects have focused on increasing the transmission capacity of links and therefore
improving efficiency while the monitoring systems developed by the group seek to facilitate the
management of assets by optimising losses and downtime
lastly with regard to the new generation of afumex ls0h cables energy consumption during production
has been reduced significantly and better surface finishing has been achieved by the development and
industrialisation of new formulas examples of this initiative within the telecom business include the
efficiencies achieved in the manufacture of data transmission cables and optical cables with loose tube and
flextube micromodule design in a specific improvement programme the speeds of the buffering lines and
the insulation lines were compared at various factories using a best practices approach this resulted in
efficiency improvements as well as a reduction in the energy consumed by these manufacturing processes
improvements achieved in relation to the category copper cables included reductions in conductor diameter
and ribbon width as well as the thickness of the insulator the use of recycled materials has been further
optimised at a number of factories
with regard to optical cables where filler is normally used to block the longitudinal penetration of water the
prysmian groups drydry platform has been further developed

the family of drydry cables with flextube micromodules has been expanded this technology is used
advantageously to reduce installation times even further and thus lower the total cost of the system
elimination of the filler in fact facilitates recycling and the separation of components
another important step has been taken in reducing the energy consumed to manufacture optical fibres the
system employed to mesh the plastic sheathing of the glass is phasing out the use of uv lamps in favour of
led lamps the qualification trials have already been completed the energy consumed to manufacture a
bobbin of fibre could be reduced by more than 20
with regard to the gas getters technology further industrial trials have identified the possibilities and
limitations of the system initial studies of materials capable of absorbing water and gas vapour have
produced interesting results
lastly improvements have been made to the cables manufactured using pvc compounds or halogenfree
formulations in order to reduce the quantity of materials used in a considerable number of products


cfp  carbon footprint
work has started on the development and application of a tool capable of providing a partial assessment of
the environmental impact of prysmian products in terms of their carbon footprint co 2 equivalent and
recyclability
these parameters will be assessed with reference to the standard design data for each product bom and
routing considering just that part of the life of each cable directly controlled or influenced by the
manufacturer the intention is to apply this tool extensively to the groups products a pilot project will be

carried out during 2017 followed by application on a vast scale in 2018

npi  new products introduction
an information tool has been developed to monitor and quantify the impact of the development of new
products at all prysmian operating units the tool is applied to new products classified into three categories
innovation product development and technology transfer and the economic results sales and
contribution margin are assessed over the first 3 years in the life of each new product starting from the first
sale


ecosustainable solutions
afumex family
in line with the main developments of safe reliable and sustainable technologies prysmian has once again
confirmed its pioneering and innovative spirit by continuing to expand the range of afumex green cables
the new member of the afumex family afumex green 1kv is now the safest and most sustainable cable on
the market
with this launch the traditional petroleumderived polyethylene used for insulation purposes is replaced by
biopolyethylene green polyethylene derived from sugar cane which is 100 renewable certified at
international level and reduces co2 emissions it is calculated that for every tonne of green polyethylene
produced more than two tonnes of carbon dioxide are captured from the atmosphere
afumex green 1kv cables meet the standards nbr5410 and nbr12570 for electrical installations in areas
with a high concentration of people in a confined environment the new green cables are used to power
machines equipment and lighting systems in general accordingly they are particularly suitable for stadiums
and arenas airports shopping centres libraries museums cinemas theatres underground railways data
centres hospitals schools and commercial and residential buildings
the afumex green range does not propagate flames in the event of fire and has very low emissions without
any toxic gases as a result it is the safest range on the market these cables are extra flexible have a
double layer do not contain lead or other heavy materials and resist temperatures of up to 90 degrees


plaser
plaser is the first high performance ecosustainable cable for electrical circuits produced using recyclable
materials plaser lowers the environmental impact of circuits while also raising their efficiency and power
transportation capacity
the prysmian groups rd department has completed a project that compared the environmental impact of
two different systems for the production of medium voltage power cables plaser and xlpe this study
used the carbon footprint methodology to quantify the entire environmental impact of each system in terms
of its emissions of co2 equivalent the results showed that the co 2 emissions associated with plaser
cables are 30 of the total emissions attributable to xlpe cables being about 8001000 kg of co2 for each
kilometre of cable produced the group is ready with the market launch of an innovative product offering
better performance at a lower cost in particular the new plaser 525 kvdc cable hvdc technology
represents a point of strength for prysmian as it will be manufactured using materials that are completely
recyclable with at the same time a reduction in co 2 emissions the manufacturing process has just one
continuous phase without chemical reactions thereby making the product faster with a lower consumption

of energy and release of greenhouse gases at the same time the technology employed also achieves a 10
reduction in power transmission costs with respect to the classic xlpe technology


plaser 600 kv hvdc
prysmian has launched an innovative technology for power transmission networks that guarantees better
electrical performance lower costs and greater environmental sustainability the 600kv plaser cable
designed for direct current hvdc applications is more efficient to manufacture than traditional xlpe
cables the worlds most powerful cable solution for the transmission of electricity is considered to be an
innovation of strategic importance in the field of high voltage cables in particular the product is able to reach
the maximum level of power transmissible while reducing costs by up to 30 per mw transmitted


aircraft completes flight around the world using solar energy
after a journey of 40000 km that took more than 500 hours leaving from abu dhabi and landing in asia
japan hawaii the united states and north africa the solar impulse 2 has completed a world tour fuelled
solely by solar energy this achievement unparalleled in the history of aviation and energy engineering was
supported by prysmian which supplied 150 km of cables designed specifically for the devices that
distributed power throughout the entire aircraft


commitments for the future
in 2017 the prysmian group is committed to pursuing product development that increases the efficiency and
reliability of products while also reducing the dissipation of energy and power implementation of the design
to cost dtc project will also continue resulting in reductions in the weight of conductors and direct
materials used in the production of cables

                                                                            2016 sustainability report  prysmian group




supply chain
strategic approach by the group
the group constantly strengthens relations with strategic suppliers seeking to build together a
common organisational process focused on sustainability throughout the entire production chain

the focus on customer service continued during 2016 this policy was adopted in prior years with the
objective of improving flexibility reliability and time to market implementation of the factory reliability
concept introduced in 2010 has improved the quality of our planning and supply processes with regard to
the control of volumes and inventory levels
group suppliers source the main raw materials used by prysmian in the production processes copper
aluminium lead various petroleum derivatives such as pvc and polyethylene and components for power
and telecom cable accessories as well as special types of glass and sheathing for optical fibre
with reference to the strategic approach adopted to supply chain management the group has established
five priorities that take environmental and social objectives into account
           only use qualified suppliers
           only use materials whose technical characteristics have been authorised
           develop strategies for commodities that guarantee continuity of supply and availability of the
            required volume in particular the financial health of the supplier is important as is only modest
            dependency on specific suppliers by prysmian
           guarantee ontime delivery and a high level of quality over time
           ensure competitive prices


purchasing of metals
the majority of the groups purchases of raw materials about 70 comprise metals especially copper and
aluminium which are a fundamental resources for our activities
with regard to the procurement of metals prysmian purchases copper and aluminium wire rod from the
worlds leading manufacturers in order to make the conductors for cables in special cases prysmian
produces its own copper rod from copper cathode but the output volume is less than 10 of total
consumption
the group absorbs slightly more than 2 of the worlds copper production and about 5 of the copper used
                                               11
in the electrical and electronic sector  given the substantial fragmentation of the copper market prysmian
is one of the leading economic players in the sector
accordingly considering the importance of the role played by suppliers within the groups value chain the
high consumption of metal and the very broad geographical distribution of prysmians factories the
procurement of metals follows two strategic directions firstly prysmian uses manufacturers that are as
integrated as possible with direct access to the raw material mines or concentrates and the ability to



11
     source global data source from natixis reuters and morgan stanley


                                                                  70

                                                                    2016 sustainability report  prysmian group


guarantee longterm suppliers secondly prysmian purchases from all major global manufacturers in order
to ensure the efficient coverage of requirements and optimise the metals logistics chain
the group has therefore chosen to develop longterm agreements veritable industrial partnerships with
integrated suppliers that guarantee sourcing for extended periods via reciprocal volume commitments the
necessary flexibility needed to follow the natural cycles of demand is assured by shortterm agreements
usually annual with considerable flexibility regarding volume these include suppliers that are not
integrated since this characteristic guarantees greater flexibility
even with regard to the purchasing of aluminium the group has decided to concentrate increasingly on
suppliers that are vertically integrated with processes that manufacture aluminium rod directly from
aluminium oxide in preference to those that are not integrated manufacturers that smelt aluminium ingots
in order to produce rod this strategy assures the security of supplies and also has cost and environmental
advantages due to simplification of the logistics and elimination of the ingot resmelting cycle
longterm strategies for the purchasing of copper and aluminium naturally lead prysmian to work with the
largest and most important companies in the respective sectors with regard to the main quantities of non
ferrous metals this approach enables the group to deal with suppliers that focus strongly on all aspects of
sustainability thus creating a highly sustainable endtoend cycle


the groups sustainable supply chain
in terms of supplier management prysmian identifies its suppliers via a formal process founded on economic
and financial analysis specifically the group examines data and information about the risk of dependency
on the suppliers considered and also about their technical and technological capabilities and skills
in order to monitor the sustainability of the supply chain especially with regard to critical suppliers the group
analyses all associated risks and opportunities on a centralised and integrated basis focusing most on the
critical risks
in this regard prysmian carried out an internal analysis of key suppliers during 2014 assessing them
against a number of sustainability criteria this analysis considered the groups strategic suppliers those
that are critical and those deemed significant in terms of the value of purchases the selected suppliers
covered about 51 of the groups purchases in 2014
continuing this approach prysmian implemented multiple initiatives in 2015 with a view to strengthening its
commitment on sustainability matters in order to guarantee the quality of the materials purchased the
group is committed to using only those raw materials approved by the responsible technical functions
following laboratory tests and extended processing trials conducted both inhouse and by qualified suppliers
this process seeks to check the environmental and social aspects as well as those of a qualitative nature
the qualification process starts by sending a questionnaire that the supplier is required to complete in full
addressing every aspect this is followed by an audit of the materials classified as critical or if further details
are needed because for example the replies to the questionnaire were not considered sufficiently complete
raw materials are considered critical if purchased from a single supplier or if the supply percentages are
particularly high or if they are used in applications that are especially demanding in terms of the
performance required

the work commenced in prior years was continued during 2016 and new initiatives were launched in
particular 10 audits of raw material and base metal suppliers were carried out consistent with the level of
activity in the prior year in one case these checks identified the need for a plan to improve certain phases of
the production process and product testing in order to guarantee the stability of quality levels
following activation in 2015 once again all new suppliers in 2016 were assessed using a qualification
questionnaire that covers environmental social and sustainability matters
with regard to the work commenced in 2015 on the management of metals suppliers work on their mapping
classification and involvement continued in 2016 using a selfassessment questionnaire designed to assess
the main parameters affecting sustainability
       integrity fair trade conflicts of interest gifts and entertainment bribery and corruption
       human and workers rights underage working health and safety nondiscrimination
       environment use of raw materials use of energy and carbon dioxide emissions water consumption
        and associated risks
       mining activities and conflict minerals resettlement closure plans and sustainable use of land
compared with 2015 when the selfassessment questionnaires covered about 80 of all metals suppliers
in 2016 the mapping managed to analyse all regular suppliers


once again in 2016 the replies to the selfassessment questionnaire were analysed by an external agency
specialised in sustainability audits this agency prepared evaluation forms for each supplier highlighting any
areas for improvement that prysmian then discussed directly during the usual negotiation meetings in this
way the groups supply chain has become much more aware of the importance that prysmian attaches to
sustainability as a criterion for the selections of suppliers and the assignment of contracts based on the
information and data collected there are no sustainability issues with any of the main base metal suppliers
used by prysmian in 2017
with regard to the work performed in relation to the suppliers of raw materials other than base metals the
group has launched 3 initiatives focusing on
       stability and continuity of production processes new system for the collection of data and the
        monitoring of supplier service levels
       anticorruption ethics especially in geographical areas commonly thought to be at risk special
        initiative addressing the supply base in china
       underage working ethics special initiative addressing mica suppliers
with a view to increasing awareness about environmental social and sustainability matters a new system
for monitoring supplier service levels was developed and implemented during 2016 the main objective is to
reduce the risk of interruptions in the flow of purchased raw materials
the report was developed together by the purchasing logistics and quality functions which defined the
related operating procedures the instrument which has already been implemented throughout europe and
is now being extended to other regions provides monthly performance indicators analysed by
countryfactorysupplier in addition a number of initiatives were launched during 2016 on matters and
geographical areas commonly thought to be at risk the entire supply base in china was asked to sign a
document confirming their commitment to and focus on our anticorruption policies and practices

further action launched in 2016 addressed a specific product category mica


a responsible approach to mica mining
in order to manufacture certain safety cables and make them fire resistant prysmian purchases limited
quantities of a few types of tape that contain small quantities of micaglass but we do not use this mineral
directly in our products and production processes the extraction process for this mineral is considered to be
at risk of underage working especially in geographical areas like india where large quantities are mined
the group tackled this issue during 2016 by requesting all suppliers of products with a subsupply of mica to
complete a questionnaire certifying the absence of child labour anywhere in the supply chain
in addition prysmian opened a dialogue on this matter with significant international peers and ngos
participating in numerous workshops and initiatives intended to analyse the issues in a responsible manner
in particular building on the report entitled beauty and a beast lets beat child labour in the mica industry
published in may 2016 by terre des hommes  an international organisation dedicated to the defence of
childrens rights and to the promotion of fair development without discrimination  prysmian took part in a
working party on these topics chaired by the ngo in collaboration with several international firms affected by
the use of this mineral possible solutions were agreed and opportunities for action were identified in order to
establish a sustainable chain of production for this mineral in the mining areas


lastly group management of potential risks in the business relationship includes supplier approval of
prysmians code of ethics in particular whenever a contract is awarded the supplier must accept and sign
the groups code of ethics in full awareness of the related rights and obligations


code of business conduct
with a view to spreading responsible commercial practices and ensuring that ethical economic
environmental and social standards are met throughout the value chain in 2014 the prysmian group
decided to promote a responsible and sustainable chain of supply by adopting a code of business conduct
this code took effect in 2015 and applies to all employees and business relations the principles set down
in the code apply to the business transactions and daily activities of the employees of all group entities and
their suppliers commercial partners commercial agents subcontractors and distributors the document
covers the following matters business integrity fair trade conflicts of interest gifts and offers of
entertainment corruption accountability human rights and those of workers underage working and
slavery health and safety at work nondiscrimination freedom of association and collective bargaining
environment principle of precautions use of raw materials and compliance use of energy greenhouse
gases and other emissions water consumption waste production and recycling
the prysmian code of business conduct was published on the groups website in 2015 in addition its
existence and prysmians application of the related guidelines are highlighted to suppliers at the scouting
and qualification stages
the above work on anticorruption and child labour in specific geographical areas and product categories
was carried out in 2016 in order to support the operational implementation of the principles laid down in the
code of business conduct in addition the groups human rights policy was extended by adding a specific

chapter on the monitoring and identification of potential violations in the supply chain with remedial action in
the first instance and if necessary the exclusion from all commercial and business relations of suppliers that
do not respond promptly to the standards required


prysmian powerlink an innovative approach to the sustainability of suppliers
prysmian powerlink implemented a cloud platform for the vendor management process about 2 years ago
with a view to improving the process of qualifying suppliers by facilitating customersupplier communications
the portal comprises two distinct section supplier information management sim and supplier
performance management spm respectively used to manage the qualification phase exante and the
performance evaluation phase expost of suppliers in particular the first area sim provides a centralised
system for managing the entire life cycle of the customersupplier relationship from the creation of the
master details database to the monitoring of financial strength indicators the data used for the selection
process is input by suppliers with direct access to the system via the completion of a questionnaire that
once completed is sent to the following functions for assessment purchasing hse installationpm quality
the second area spm guides the process of defining measuring monitoring and analysing the
performance of suppliers in terms of the service provided the purpose of the system is to improve the
quality of service while achieving an overall reduction in costs and the related risks each supplier is
assessed against specific criteria compliance with technical hse and quality requirements and level of
contractual and business flexibility in the event of an adverse result prysmian will be able to promote
corrective actions designed to steadily improve performance or depending on the seriousness of the case
to blacklist the supplier to date out of 355 registered suppliers more than 90 have been qualified and
84 are used regularly the others must still complete the qualification process while a small number
representing about 2 of the total have been blacklisted and are not used


purchasing professional academy
prysmian group academy is the groups international professional and management education and training
school over the past three years the professional school has specifically addressed purchasing by
delivering an annual oneweek course for 30 participants that combines contributions from highly
professional internal lecturers from both corporate hq and country management with those from external
supply chain professionals attendance is open to buyers from all group companies with a view to reviewing
purchasing fundamentals and the integrated management of global commodities
a section dedicated to understanding the importance of sustainability matters entitled purchasing 
sustainability has been included since 2015 this lesson focused on sustainability with the prysmian group
as it relates to the supply chain and purchasing highlighting the activities and topics of concern to the
function and also covering aspects of the groups code of business conduct additionally the lesson guided
buyers to take full account of sustainability when scouting for and selecting suppliers alongside the
traditional selection criteria based on technical economic and financial parameters risk management and
overall cost effectiveness by the end of 2016 25 of prysmian purchasing personnel around the world
have received training in this area

logistics
the logistics function manages all the groups intercompany flows both at annual budget and monthly
operational level with the aim of satisfying demand in all markets that do not have a local production source
due to capability or production capacity reasons the logistics function also manages short and medium
term production allocations and planning through the sales  operations planning sop process which
links the demand cycle sales with the supply cycle manufacturing and procurement the groups planning
activities differ depending on how the product is classified engineer to order products are used mostly in
energy projects for submarine high voltage and umbilical cables being businesses in which the prysmian
group supports customers from the design of the system to the final laying of the cables assemble to
order products allow the group to respond rapidly to demand for items that use standard components and
which are only differentiated at the final stages of production or in terms of packaging while maintaining
minimum inventories of finished products make to order products are only manufactured and shipped after
receiving an order from the customer thus reducing the level of slowmoving inventories considerably while
increasing the rotation of raw materials components and finished products the make to stock approach is
generally used for the most standardised products which require an inventory management policy capable
of responding rapidly to demand this last model is mostly applied in the energy products and telecom
areas
the prysmian group continued the strategic focus on customer centricity during 2016 stabilising the high
level of service achieved in terms of delivery reliability while at the same time starting work to reduce the
leadtime between the receipt of an order to delivery of the product to the customer the group has also
continued work on the reduction of inventories overall 60 million euro lower than in 2015 on a likeforlike
basis with a further positive effect on cash flows
further the optimisation of the distribution chain has continued at the operational macroregion level with a
particular focus on the consolidation of warehousesdistribution centres and the outsourcing of logistics
services in order to lower distribution costs
the logistics function has optimised the allocation of production with an increase in intercompany flows in
line with the consolidation of the global organisation into regions consistent with the groups strategic
objectives and in addition to the customer centricity and factory reliability initiatives during 2016 the
prysmian group continued the work carried out in recent years to improve our logistics services in terms of
flexibility timeliness and shorter leadtimes
the distribution logistics market in 2016 was characterised by the continued excess capacity of all leading
airlines while carriage by sea also continued to demonstrate unused capacity due to an increased number of
ships and containers as well as to the ongoing consolidation processes implemented by the main global
carriers prysmian has concentrated work to improve physical distribution in the southeast asia  china
region reducing the number of sea carriers to just one with a marked reduction in costs and improved
efficiency
in addition projects for the outsourcing of logistics 3pl have been implemented in north america usa
and canada and in europe united kingdom applying the same format and best practices already found in
the area in order to obtain significant cost savings

       during the year in the context of the prysmian academy the logistics function continued the process
       launched in 2015 of training the logisticsmanufacturing personnel who work for the groups affiliates
       around the world implemented over a period of several days and using internal lecturers the objective of
       this course is to facilitate networking enhance the professional standing of the individuals concerned and
       share ways to improve the groups logistics and make them more efficient


       commitments for the future
       during 2017 the optical fibre business unit will continue to prefer sea shipments between north america
       and europe rather than air shipments with a view to reducing the environmental impact of product
       transportation
       the expected reduction in air carriage was not achieved in 2016 due to a shortage of optical fibre caused by
       the growth in the world market china in particular for optical cables however prysmian has planned
       capacity increases that will enable the more balanced scheduling of optical fibre in raw material form during
       2017 this will ensure a reduction in air transport costs for the optical fibre business with a consequent
       beneficial effect on the environment in terms of emissions
       in addition the group will continue to encourage the replacement of road transportation with carriage by sea
       lastly prysmian is committed to using 3pl when negotiating future north american and australian carriage
       contracts in order to actively reduce ghg emissions via the optimisation of transportation

       small diameter drums are made from plasticplywood wood is used up to 3 metres in diameter while larger
       drums for cables are made from steel in general the drum material selected depends on the diameter and
       length of the cable criteria for the optimisation of logistics in order to reduce the carbon footprint and
       specific requests from customers associated with regulatory aspects in the destination country
       the group is heavily committed to maximising the reutilisation of drums and lowering their environmentalwooden drums
       impact for example this involves using wood from replanted forests and implementing lagging solutions
       that reduce the recourse made to quality materials while continuing to use recyclable materials this
       commitment over the years has helped to improve the reuse rate of drums as a consequence of our more
       precise and modern management techniques

targeting the groups executives the system was then extended to the entire managerial and clerical
population in all countries involving as in the past two years around 5000 persons in 2016
the objectives of the prysmian people performance system are to
       align personal objectives with those of the group thereby motivating each employee to do their best
        and generate value for the entire organisation creating a single business identity

about 800 staff involved in 2016
following various talent assessment and measurement projects and not least in accordance with the
recommendations of the italian stock exchange code of selfgovernance on management succession in
2015 the group  acting on a mandate from the compensation and appointments committee  decided to
streamline its talent assessment procedure by introducing a single process for the identification of talent and
the preparation of succession plans
accordingly for the first time the group introduced a structured process for the identification of talent in
2016 known as p4 prysmian people performance potential together with mercer a consultancy the
main purpose of this process is to assess potential and predict future performance in roles of greater
responsibility
the process is based on prysmians definition of talent as the sum of consistent performance and potential
that was identified from a series of structured interviews with 35 key group managers
consistent performance means having delivery good results in at least the two previous years as
determined using the p3 assessment system while potential means a combination of 8 personality traits that
are important for the group
this process launched in march 2016 involved all participants in the p3 process in the following phases
            potential scouting all employees were screened with reference to the consistent performance
             criteria this scouting activity involved about 800 employees defined as consistent performers
             via the guided observation of 8 traits indicating potential and a rating of potential on a scale of 1
             to 3
            talent pools all assessments were consolidated in a 9quadrant matrix and consolidated by
             organisational band giving rise to the talent pools
            talent discussion discussion committees met in each country in order to review the results of
             the observations made and prepare the succession tables
            group validation all countrylevel reports were discussed at an annual meeting in order to
             identify a talent pool of about 300 persons which will be reviewed every year
            external assessment for 10 strategic positions an external partner spencer stuart was
             involved on completion of the process to make an independent assessment of the potential of
             about 30 managers in order to evaluate their readiness
given the good results achieved in 2016 and the importance of this process in terms of risk assessment and
the sustainability of the business it has been confirmed and established as an annual process that will
constantly monitor the pipelines and the risk of discontinuities affecting critical positions
with regard to the evaluation of talent it is useful to highlight the work carried out in the academy
classrooms in partnership with ceb a consultancy in particular consistent with the p4 process a process
of leadership assessment and development was included in the leadership programmes of the school of

international mobility
as of 31 december 2016 the prysmian groups expat population counts about 233 employees from about
30 different countries 36 are italians who are living in 36 different destination countries of these 72
are at a nonexecutive level and 16 are women there were 88 new departures during 2016
these statistics evidence the importance of the international mobility programme within the group
international mobility is an integral part of the groups policies for the growth and development of talent on
the one hand it spreads the culture and values of prysmian to all countries and group affiliates which is a
need that became central following the acquisition of the draka group in 2011 on the other hand
international mobility helps to meet local organisational requirements via the transfer of managerial and
technical knowhow from one country to another
in this regard the implementation of the new policy and mobility processes continued during 2016 with a
view to aligning prysmians policy with the most advanced market practices in order to facilitate expatriation
even outside of the groups headquarters align the conditions and segment the various types of assignment
international experience is also central to the professional and managerial growth of the young talents
participating in the graduate programme
during 2016 40 new graduates from 18 countries of origin commenced an international experience due to
last two years in 19 destination countries
despite this great attention to internationalism and the crosscountry development of resources the
prysmian group also dedicates much energy to appreciation of the cultural diversity that exists within each
country where the group is present about 58 of the groups senior executives work in their country of
origin
international mobility during 2017 will again focus on guaranteeing the success of the international
assignments as measured in terms of its effectiveness in transferring knowhow and developing the local
team efforts will also be made to improve the career planning for expatriates on completion of their
international assignment
the success of the international mobility policy very much depends on expatriates sharing and strengthening
prysmians identity culture and values with local teams thus strengthening cohesion while also drawing on
the diversity of talent available across borders in order to obtain superior results for the group

remuneration policies
the compensation  benefit policies adopted by the prysmian group are designed to attract and retain
highly professional resources especially for key positions having regard for the complexity and specialised
nature of the business growing internationalisation requires constant focus on the different geographical
realities in order to ensure assignment of the right talents in the context of a competitive marketplace the
policies are defined in a way that aligns the interests of management with those of shareholders pursuing
the priority objective of creating sustainable value over the mediumlongterm by building a real verifiable
link between pay and performance both individually and at group level
these policies are defined and implemented centrally in relation to executive personnel about 300
employees and expatriates 233 employees but are addressed locally for all other employees subject to
the guidelines which are issued centrally

       launch of the specialrate share purchase plan named yes for the period 20162018
       introduction of a sector benchmark for the executive directors
       launch of a total reward project that links remuneration policies more directly with processes of
        assessing performance and potential
in addition detailed and specific analyses of earning levels were carried out in certain pilot countries during
2016 in order to develop a method of analysis that can be implemented by all divisions within the group in
particular data was analysed for the population in a number of the groups main regions
the remuneration policy for executive directors and executives with strategic responsibilities is determined
as the result of an agreed and transparent process during which the compensation and nominations
committee and the board of directors of the company both play a central role every year in fact the
compensation and nominations committee submits the remuneration policy to the board of directors for
approval and checks on its application during the year
the pay structure for executive directors and managers with strategic responsibilities and executives
comprises a fixed component a shortterm variable component and a mediumlongterm variable component
the monetaryequity offer is supported by additional benefits such as supplementary welfare additional
medical care personal accident policies a company car for staff who are entitled to one and company
canteen or restaurant vouchers these benefits are adapted to local conditions having regard for market
characteristics and relevant regulations all employees in the milan office have access to doctors at
specialist medical facilities and their children can obtain grants for advanced secondary education and for
their university studies the benefits available to fulltime workers are also available to those on parttime
contracts the analysis was broadened in 2016 to include such new intangible benefits as smart working
and flexible hours
work also continues on the global mapping of benefit policies prior to commencing rationalisation work and
welfare development projects
after this analysis the group intends to evaluate the implementation where possible of flexible benefit
projects and the launch of new initiatives that draw on existing approaches greater focus and investment in
this area will undoubtedly improve employee engagement and consequently the results of the group this

focus on individuals is confirmed by the prysmian groups commitment to investing in the development of
employeecompany relations via numerous initiatives designed to encourage involvement the group also
signs agreements with external partners for the supply of products and services on attractive terms to
employees such as discounts on theatre tickets gym subscriptions magazines and products purchased in
shops notable initiatives include that of prysmian australia which via the issue of discount coupons and
other benefits for employees has launched a partnership with a supplier and an online and mobile service
that allows benefits to be customised to meet the needs of each person in addition prysmian hungary
organised a corporate family day and other minor events during the year while action taken in romania
promoted health insurance discounts for employees as well as the implementation of a welfare policy that
supports the families of employees afflicted by serious or incurable illnesses prysmian brazil has also taken
similar action while also providing its employees with health cover
following a trial last year prysmian russia offers employees a chance to send their children to summer
camps with 80 reimbursement of the cost additionally the most deserving children of employees are
eligible for study grants from the age of 14 until they graduate from university
in finland prysmian has promoted healthcare designed to increase wellness in the workplace involving
medical examinations vaccines and other specific procedures
the prysmian group also provides a series of postemployment benefit plans via programmes that include
defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans
the defined contribution plans envisage payment by the group based on legal or contractual obligations of
contributions to public or private insurance institutions
the group satisfies its obligations by making these contributions the defined benefit plans principally
include pension funds employee severance indemnities for italian companies medical care plans and
other benefits such as longservice awards
the remuneration policy and longterm incentive plans were well received by the stakeholders votes in
favour exceeded 98 whose opinions and feedback are considered when preparing the annual policy in
fact the human resources department analyses the reports and opinions obtained from the main proxy
advisors about the compensation report and the incentive plans and recommends amendments and
changes in practices in response to this input
in the context of transparency on compensation matters the group has issued guidelines in accordance with
local laws to link pay measures to all levels of the organisation while variable pay schemes will be linked to
individual performance appraisal the fixed element of remuneration is reviewed annually and if necessary
updated to remain competitive with market conditions while also considering internal equity personal
performance and the requirements of local regulations this meritocratic approach is based on a global
system of performance assessment p3 that is applied on a consistent basis throughout the entire group

shares as a welcome bonus the objectives pursued by this plan are to increase the involvement sense of
belonging and business understanding of our employees confirm the shared longterm mutual interests of
employees customers and shareholders and strengthen the internal perception of the prysmian group as
truly one company in short the wish expressed by the group via the launch of this plan is to encourage
employees to become stable shareholders thus making them owners of a small part of the business in
which they work
the yes programme has proved to be a real success it was taken up by more than 7200 employees
around 44 of the entitled population became shareholders participation in the plan in certain countries

following the success of yes a meeting was held at the milan stock exchange during 2016 where over
200 employees from many countries acting as yes ambassadors participated in one day of courses on the
programme
the high level of participation convinced prysmian to extend the programme with a few changes for another
three years with a view to increasing employee share ownership to at least 15 of the total
the shareholders meeting held in april 2016 approved extension of the plan to 2019 raised the number of
bonus shares at the time of subscription 8 for those who have already participated 3 in subsequent years
introduced a loyalty bonus for those who decide to extend the lockup period for their shares and improved
the flexibility of the plan rules multiple windows purchase close to the subscription exit clauses linked to the
personal life of individuals
the promotional campaign carried out in december 2016 suggests that the results will be good with a
considerable number of acceptances 5200 participants and investment estimated to exceed 6 million euro
based on this more than 50 of employees will be shareholders the shares will be purchased during 2017

communities
corporate citizenship and philanthropy initiatives
aware of the importance of people and the territories in which it operates the prysmian group is
committed to building a socially responsible business by supporting via specific initiatives the
economic social and cultural development of those areas

relations with local communities are important for the creation of value around prysmian during 2016 the
group continued pursuit of its commitment to be socially responsible by supporting via specific initiatives
the economic social and cultural development of the areas in which it is present in addition to direct
economic contributions and donations in kind when allowed by the corporate citizenship and philanthropy
policy the prysmian group also provides indirect support for social projects via the hours paid to employees
involved in the charitable activities
the main activities during the year involved various areas and were concentrated in italy other european
countries such as france hungary spain and germany and elsewhere such as russia china and
australia


corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy
with a view to defining common shared rules within the group for identifying corporate citizenship and
philanthropy initiatives correlated with business operations during 2014 prysmian decided to update the
policy governing activities that benefit local communities
the group believes that access to energy and telecommunications is a prerequisite for the economic and
social development of local communities for this reason the corporate citizenship and philanthropy
activities promoted must be principally intended to support initiatives that facilitate access to energy and
telecommunications by local populations with particular reference to those in developing countries
the group considers initiatives for the benefit of the community as those relating to
    communities longterm initiatives that aim to mitigate socioenvironmental issues in the communities in
     which the group does business
    charitable gifts shortterm initiatives or oneoff donations to nongovernmental organisations and
     supranational and local nonprofit organisations
    commercial initiatives that benefit the community initiatives that support prysmians success directly
     conducted in partnership with communitybased organisations

headquarters
in line with the initiatives undertaken in 2015 prysmian decided to renew our commitment in favour of the
unhcr united nations high commission for refugees in 2016 by making a donation from employees and
the group in favour of the population of ecuador afflicted by an earthquake there in april 2016 the unhcr
used part of the donation to give those affected basic supplies such as tents and other immediate
necessities such as kitchen sets and mosquito repellents given the risk of zika virus contagion in addition
some of the funds were used to purchase solarpowered lights
the decision to work with the unhcr by supplying solar lamps was part of the wider strategy described in
the groups corporate citizenship and philanthropy policy which commits prysmian to providing active
support for initiatives that promote access to solar energy and telecommunications
in 2016 prysmian also contributed significantly to the collection of funds by the italian red cross in favour of
the victims of the earthquake that hit central italy in august in particular the group decided to double the
amount donated by employees thereby raising a considerable sum the italian red cross activated more
than 4000 volunteers right from the start and guaranteed more than 33000 meals to the populations
affected
lastly the group contributed  via a cash donation  to the las mariposas project that in siena and the
surrounding area provides psychological support to the victims of sexual abuse the project is part of the
codice rosa service that provides access to first aid solely for the victims of violence women men and
children who have been mistreated and abused in order to improve steadily the firstaid services that

the young electricians participating so that they could compete and show their skills as well as to know and
appreciate the groups cables


commitments for the future
during 2017 prysmian will analyse additional group corporate citizenship and philanthropy initiatives using
the social return on investment sroi methodology this methodology makes it possible to measure the
social environmental and economic impact of the activities assessed using monetary values that highlight
the relationship between the investment made in an initiative and the return on that investment

environment

prysmian and the environment
the group strives actively to safeguard and protect the environment and conserve natural resources
in order to create sustainable value for the benefit of both the organisation and our stakeholders
the groups commitment to safeguarding the environment and conserving natural resources is expressed
not only by the intrinsic characteristics of our products but also by how our production systems are managed
in particular the prevention and reduction of their environmental impact is achieved for example by the
efficient use of natural resources the optimisation of logistics flows and the responsible management of
waste prysmian worked hard during the year to enhance our performance on environmental matters
additionally considering the aspects deemed significant at group level the health safety  environment
function also hse worked with other business functions to establish the hse objectives for the period to
2020 and plan the actions required each year in order to make steady progress towards these goals
the hse function has further consolidated the scope of its activities at various levels within the group 
corporate country or region business unit or production unit  centralising activities and coordinating the
work of the local hse functions application of the health safety and environment policy the operating
procedures and the groups technical standards was maintained and extended to additional operating units
the effectiveness and proper application at local level of the health safety and environment rules were also
checked periodically with support from a grouplevel audit team
furthermore significant variables and indicators were again monitored regularly to check the effectiveness
of health safety and environment activities including compliance with health and safety at work standards
energy consumption waste management water usage and greenhouse gas emissions in particular with
reference to the last mentioned the group has strengthened the process of collecting energy consumption
data in order to track both direct emissions deriving from production processes and indirect emissions
deriving from the energy purchased this system of monitoring and reporting enabled the group to
participate in 2016 once again in the carbon disclosure project cdp climate change section the cdp
is an international initiative that seeks to contribute to the pursuit of the objectives agreed in the kyoto
protocol regarding the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
further developments in this area will be made possible by considering the outcome of the energy audits
carried out in 2015 and 2016 at a number of european factories deemed representative in order to identify
actions to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions work is well advanced on the
implementation of tools for assessing and managing the environmental impact of products and in particular
their carbon footprints
about 160 inspections for certification purposes were carried out at the various factories during the year of
which about 12 were carried out by experienced prysmian personnel the other inspections were
performed by auditors from external certification agencies
significant events during 2016 included the investment of about 8 million euro in health safety and
environmental activities

in addition to training initiatives prysmian has continued to manage various activities including active
participation in various working parties and on association committees such as europacables ecoe
committee orgalimes substances task force anies environment committee and aices environment
working party and the iec maintenance team that is drafting the standard environmental declaration for
power cables
the approach to integration adopted represents an opportunity to improve and in this light operational
policies and practices for the management of the environment health and safety by all operating units will be
further developed and agreed in this regard the prysmian group uses qualiquantitative parameters to
monitor environmental performance and health and safety in the workplace
the environment and safety management system was established centrally from the start in order to
guarantee uniformity throughout the group via the coordination provided by the corporate hse function in
particular hse involvement in defining the preventive and corrective actions applicable at group level and
in checking effectiveness at local level has contributed to the maintenance and consolidation of the hse
system and to the creation of a team of hsequalified auditors within the group
future developments will include further strengthening of the central coordination concept with a view to
transforming the environment and safety management system into a multisite model that is certified by the
corporate head office in accordance with an annual audit plan this change will maximise the efficiencies
and synergies released by the revised system especially in terms of improved performance and lower costs
in this context the new milan headquarters will be certified as a specific operating unit resulting therefore in
its immediate inclusion in the multisite model as the head office
among the common initiatives the hse function identified two projects  relamping with led and smart
metering relating respectively to the replacement of traditional lighting with led bulbs and the introduction
of systems for the measurement of consumption at production units  to be pursued from 2016 onwards
the hse function activated the relamping with led project during 2016 giving priority to a number of
operating units that have already had an energy audit and has commenced the preparatory work in order to
ensure a consistent approach within the group the hse function has distributed guidelines to all local
organisations on the replacement of traditional lighting with led bulbs in addition prysmian has selected a
partner for the performance of certain preliminary work which includes checking adoption of the guidelines
with reference to local legislative requirements and preparing technical specifications following this work
suppliers will be selected for the design and installation of the first led lighting systems during 2017
as a result of this project electricity consumption will be reduced together with the operating costs of the
lighting installations depending on location the estimated savings range from 10 to 70 of the current
consumption for lighting purposes led technology has in fact a various advantages over traditional lighting
sources such as energy saving an average life that is 6 times longer than traditional bulbs easy
maintenance and relatively rapid recovery of the initial investment
in addition during 2016 a number of pilot projects were launched at production units considered
representative within the group in order to carry out a more detailed and specific analysis of energy
consumption considering the production plant engineering and maintenance needs of each location the
types of supply any existing restrictions and climate data the objective is to determine if there are any plant
engineering or operational solutions that would reduce energy consumption and the emission of pollutants

november energy efficiency month in italy
the group decided to participate actively in the initiatives carried out in italy during november which was
labelled energy efficiency month the prysmian group responded to this invitation in order to increase
employee awareness about the importance of energy efficiency by explaining the results of current and
future projects at group level and promoting new action on the topic of energy saving
this campaign promoted by the ministry of economic development and implemented by the national
agency for new technologies energy and sustainable development enea involved institutions and
companies in events intended to raise public awareness of the need to stop wasting energy our
participation included seminars and work to analyse and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases
as well as adoption of the smart metering project this project was launched with the preparation of
prysmian guidelines that will be circulated to all local organisations in early 2017 in order to introduce
systems for the measurement of consumption that will facilitate reporting on consumption and the savings
made as well as optimise the use of energy via the effect of constant monitoring smart metering is a system
based on sensors with a wireless interface that monitors energy consumption and facilitates the storage of
data so that aggregated data can be used subsequently


management systems
during the year the prysmian group continued work to coordinate the groups hse management systems
by
         extending ohsas 18001 certification of the safety management system to an additional 5 locations
          and iso 14001 certification of the environmental management system to one additional location
         upgrading the iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certifications of prysmian power link the organisation
          that installs hv terrestrial and submarine cables by extending their field of application to the design
          and supervision of production and by combining the iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 audits into one
          programme
         adopting an integrated auditing system two additional factories compared with 2015
         using the official certification agency at factories previously certified by other agencies in particular
          during 2016 4 factories changed to the official agency for iso 14001 certification regarding
          environment management systems and 2 changed in relation to ihsas 18001 certification this
          change has helped to coordinate the management systems with the periodic checking of the
          groups hse procedures by the external agency and the involvement of hse in defining and
          agreeing the corrective actions to be taken at the various group factories 91 and 73 of which
          were respectively iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certified at the end of 2016 these percentages
          take account of the new certifications mentioned above 5 additional locations with ohsas 18001
          certification and 1 with iso 14001


life cycle assessment
implementation of the life cycle assessment methodologies continued during 2016 with a particular focus
on the carbon footprint aspects the methodology chosen was to create an automatic assessment system
that by combining environmental information about materials and processes with the design data for the

various families of cable determines their environmental impact in carbon footprint terms accordingly the
collaboration between hse and rd has been consolidated with a view to bringing together the two types
of information the system will therefore enable rapid assessment of the carbon footprint of various types of
cable considering both the production of their raw materials and all the stages and processes in their
manufacture starting from within prysmian to the final storage of the cable the definition of the automatic
assessment system will be completed during 2017 leading to the launch of a second phase involving initial
practical use of the system in order to identify specific categories of cable for priority attention


restart of the guatapé hydroelectric plant
prysmian mexico has successfully completed a massive recovery task  coordinated with two south
american customers empresas publicas de medellìn eps a columbian public utility and mexicos
federal electricity commission cfo  relating to the restart of the guatapé hydroelectric plant this plant
on columbias largest dam supplies about 4 of the countrys electricity a fire seriously damaged many
installations in february 2016 and as a result it was also found necessary to replace the 230kv cables
previously supplied by prysmian to eps but never installed acting as a mediator between customers from
different countries prysmian facilitated transfer of the required cables between eps and cfo given the
great urgency of the operation the transportation was organised using two ukrainian aircraft the recovery
efforts completed in june 2016 involved over 100 persons counting eps employees and prysmian
professionals


pikkala factories open to visitors
a number of guided tours of the prysmian factories in pikkala finland were arranged in september 2016
enabling many local residents to make contact with the business and understand better the work carried out
by the group in their country in particular the visitors  including many children  were able to find out how
cables are designed and produced and learn about the importance of safety in the workplace the pikkala
factory is considered to be of great strategic importance to the group to the extent that it was chosen to hold
the meeting with stakeholders scheduled for february 2017


alert not all cables are the same
prysmian turkeys advertising campaign launched in 2012 and now in its fourth edition focuses attention on
a different product each time the objective for 2016 was to increase consumer awareness about cables for
photovoltaic installations working together with prysmian germany the turkish division participated at the
solar energy and technology exhibition  solarex istanbul at the istanbul exhibition centre where the
impact of environmental factors on cables was discussed and consumers were helped to understand the
risks associated with choosing the wrong cables


commitments for the future
with reference to the hse policy and use of the hse management system in recent years prysmian has
launched various initiatives intended to use resources efficiently and reduce the environmental impact of

awareness campaigns about the consumption of energy these initiatives have generated various benefits
in both environmental and cost reduction terms in order to proceed in a systematic and orderly manner the
activities already started have been included within a group project entitled energy efficiency and carbon
reduction which is coordinated centrally by the corporate hse function in order to
        report increasingly precise and reliable data and information at group level about consumption and
         greenhouse gas emissions
        define improvement objectives particularly in relation to the reduction of energy consumption and
         greenhouse gas emissions at group level involving corporate and all other levels of the
         organisation in planning the initiatives and activities necessary in order to meet the commitments
         made
        propose and launch energy efficiency initiatives consistent with the regulations eg directive
         201227eu on energy efficiency the specific campaigns promoted at national level and more
         generally the commitments accepted at the paris conference on climate change cop 21
        select and coordinate the specific projects to be implemented by the groups operating units in
         order to comply with prysmians commitments with regard to sustainability while calibrating carefully
         the effort required with reference to local operating needs
interesting results have emerged with reference to the possible introduction of cogeneration systems and
review of the rephasing logic for electrical installations in order to increase the number of concrete results
these studies will be extended to additional operating units within the group during 2017
based on the experience and positive results obtained following the energy audits carried out in prior years
during 2017 group hse will plan and coordinate further energy diagnostics in order to obtain a database
and information for the launch of similar efficiency improvement projects at other operating units within the
group
with regard to management systems the prysmian group plans to obtain additional ohsas 18001
certifications and to obtain both iso 14001 and ohsas 18001 certifications for the milan headquarters

main initiatives to lower environmental impact


power cables
a process for the recovery and reuse of waste copper found in the sludge generated from the production of
wire rod has been introduced in rayong thailand this process separates the sludge from the recoverable
copper that once collected can be recycled as a raw material in the smelting process before implementing
this process a feasibility study was carried out to ensure that the recovered copper would not degrade the
quality of the wire rod activation of this recycling process has therefore reduced the weight of the copper
sludge resulting in disposal of just that fraction of the sludge remaining after the copper has been separated
out
the water cooling plant has been replaced at kistelek hungary thus reducing the quantity of r422d
refrigerant gas a greenhouse gas
the quantity of fluorinated gases has been reduced at the slatina plant in romania by replaced a number
of refrigeration units with one centralised device this device also reduces gas leaks and the necessary
maintenance work action to improve the efficiency of water consumption has also been completed at this
factory this work which commenced in 2014 had two distinct phases initially repair of the levelling
systems for the water tanks to avoid accidental discharges subsequently efforts concentrated on retaining
the industrial water including the cooling water for testing activities within the recirculation circuits for a
longer period thus reducing the water replacement frequency all these actions were carried out by the
factorys technical services under the supervision of the hse function lastly the percentage of waste sent
for recycling was increased during 2016 via a procedure that involves storing the waste for two days so that
the portion to be recycled can be separated from the rest
numerous improvements in the waste sector have been made at gron france largely with regard to waste
compounds solvents that generate hazardous waste packaging and water consumption in particular the
water recirculation circuit has been improved
water consumption at prysmian berlin has been reduced by optimising the cooling system for certain
process lines
action has been taken at giovinazzo italy to reduce the amount of waste compound disposed by
recovering and reusing waste polymers in addition water consumption has been optimised by repairing
losses in the recirculation circuit for the waters used in insulation line processes
lastly work has been carried out to reduce water consumption in north dighton usa and nieuw bergen
netherlands by making improvements to the steam generator and a new water cooling system

the slatina factory romania has reached an important milestone by sending 100 of all waste generated
for recycling

in nuremberg prysmian germany has worked to reduce water consumption by installing wider diameter
pipes in the water return circuit thus avoiding excessive filling and consequent overflows especially during
periods of heavy rain this together with the overflow control system has reduced the need to replace the
cooling waters used for processing purposes as a specified volume of water can now be maintained in the
circuit at all times

presentation of environmental data
among the matters common to all operating units prysmian has selected those that are significant not only
in environmental terms but also in terms of its responsibilities towards employees and local communities
and as a competitive factor that contributes value to the group these aspects are considered significant
and this report presents indicators showing their importance
           energy consumption obtained as the sum of all energy sources used in manufacturing and service
            activities
           water consumption which is significant due to the large volumes needed for cooling in the various
            production cycles
           hazardous and nonhazardous waste with a potential impact on various environmental factors and
            very considerable importance in the assessment of process efficiency
           ozonedepleting substances which although small in amount are present in almost every production
            unit in order to prevent leakages and reduce their potential atmospheric impact
           greenhouse gas emissions ghg primarily linked to the use of sources of energy and to a very
            limited extent to the use of greenhouse gases at certain stages of production
           efficiency in the use of raw materials given the intensive use of valuable metals such as copper and
            aluminium as an essential part of most production processes as well as the amount of scrap
            generated
based on assessments and past experience the group does not report on the following aspects which are
considered to be less significant
           waste water originating from cooling systems if not contained within a closedcircuit system and if
            not requiring special treatment
           atmospheric emissions generated by production processes which are not especially significant in
            most cases

greenhouse gas emissions ghg
greenhouse gas emissions measured in tonnes of co 2 equivalent were calculated using the methodologies
indicated in the greenhouse gas protocol a corporate accounting and reporting standard revised
edition 2004 considering for the scope 1 emissions the consumption of fuels the release of overflow
refrigerant gases and the use of sf6 and for the scope 2 emissions the consumption of purchased
energy mainly electricity
emissions totalled 683562 tco2eq in 2016 down with respect to 2015 the reduction was mostly
attributable to the scope 2 emissions due to a change in the scope of reporting following the closure of a
number of factories

greenhouse gas emissions ghg following the purchase of guarantee of origin
certificates
prysmian is a diversified multinational group accordingly two main methods are used to account for scope
2 emissions the locationbased method and the marketbased method both methods described below are
recognised and required by the ghg protocol and must be used to report on scope 2 emissions in the
cdps climate change program from 2016

locationbased method
this method for quantifying scope 2 co2 emissions is based on average emission factors for the generation
of electricity within welldefined geographical boundaries local subnational or national
marketbased method
this method for quantifying scope 2 co2 emissions is based on the co2 emissions of the energy suppliers
from which the reporter company that prepares the report purchases a package of electricity under
contract markets are differentiated by the contracts available for the purchase of energy or by the specific
attributes claimed but can include certificates guaranteeing the origin of the energy and direct contracts with
suppliers recs gos irec etc specific emission factors of the supplier default emission factors
representing the energy and emissions that are not monitored or not claimed known as residual mix
regional or average subnational or national emission factors

with reference to electricity consumption in 2016 the prysmian group purchased guarantee of origin
certificates from a number of european suppliers in order to increase the percentage of energy consumed by
the group that was derived from renewable sources thus reducing the corresponding co 2 emissions
determined using the marketbased method of calculation this initiative further contributed to reducing the
groups co2 emissions which were 176 lower than in 2015 using the locationbased approach on the
other hand the groups co2 emission were 49 lower than in 2015

waste
the main types of waste generated by productive activities have been split into specific categories
classifying their level of danger hazardous waste and nonhazardous waste according to the related
classification system regardless of the wastes country of origin and disposal an exception is made for
certain types of waste such as laboratory chemicals whose allocation among the categories depends on
local regulatory requirements
overall the total volume of waste disposed has fallen with respect to 2015 in particular the volume of non
hazardous waste 74 while the volume of hazardous waste rose slightly 4 total waste disposed in
2016 amounted to 91453247 kg

hazardous waste has increased in general except in the optical fibre sector there are several reasons for
this mostly linked to the disposal of certain types of waste that not being generated constantly over time
fluctuates from one annual report to another the main categories of waste concerned are spent oils
emulsions from drawing tanks and machinery processing residue and other waste generated by preventive
maintenance work other factors might also include specific anomalies affecting certain processing lines the
malfunction of a metal sheathing extruder that resulted in the exceptional disposal of contaminated oils and
metals changes in the production mix the malfunction of the level control and circuits of tanks containing oil
based emulsions
by contrast with the hazardous waste the production of nonhazardous waste has decreased more
especially in the two main production categories telecom cables and energy cables at individual factory
level the greatest changes were due to the types of waste whose disposal is not a continuous process

total water consumption fell by about 8 in 2016 compared with 2015 this outcome is however partly
influenced by locations that  due to closure or timerelated factors  did not communicated their
environmental data these factories were by contrast included in the scope of reporting in 2015

the combined energy factories together achieved a net reduction in consumption even on a unit of
production basis this reduction is therefore real and not due solely to the exit of operating units from the
scope of reporting despite a slight decrease in the quantity of water consumed per unit of production the
consumption of the optical fibre factories increased overall although the increases in the telecom and
accessories sectors were more evident
in many cases the differences at local level were due to losses from water pipes which resulted in
increased consumption if they occurred during 2016 but decreased consumption if they occurred previously
and were repaired in 2016 in a few cases the changes were due to meter malfunctions occurring in 2016
or occurring previously and resolved in 2016

percentage of process water recirculated
process water  eg that used to cool semifinished products  is recirculated at numerous factories in
whole or in part depending on the situation in order to avoid excessive consumption in order to better
understand the degree of efficiency achieved in the use of water the application of the methodology devised
in collaboration with the merlino factory to determine the percentage of water recirculated with respect to
total water consumption has been extended the concept is based on how much is saved compared with
not having a recirculation plant in relation to the total quantity of water consumed for processing reasons
due to evaporation occasional emptying of the circuit or the lack or only partial installation of a recirculation
plant
the formula is being applied to an increasing number of factories and in 2016 about 60 of operating units
supplied results in terms of water recirculated as a percentage of the total quantity used in the
overwhelming majority of cases hydraulic circuits are served by a recirculation system and in over 60 of
these recirculated water accounts for 99 or more of the total water used while about 20 of factories
recirculate between 95 and 99 of their water just 10 between 90 and 95 and 10 less than 90
since their recirculation systems do not cover all their hydraulic circuits yet
the above results were provided by the following countries argentina brazil china estonia france
germany indonesia italy norway russia sweden turkey uk hungary romania slovak republic
czech republic certain us operating units netherlands
the percentages stated above may of course change as application of the formula is extended to other
factories in order to obtain full coverage of the group

environment
notes on the scope and methods of reporting
the environmental indicators presented in this report derive from a system of reporting that compared with
the scope of reporting stated in this report do not include data relating to the rd laboratories or the
offices as their environmental impact is low two recentlyacquired production units both in oman muscat
and sohar a factory in malaysia kuala lumpur and one in china wuhan no longer under prysmian
control are also not included in the data together with the factories at presov slovak republic and merlino
italy for which data was unavailable and certain production units whose data collection methods are not
fully aligned with those of the group being pune chiplun india grombalia tunisia lastly compared
with last year the scope of reporting does not include data from shanghai china were production has been
suspended or data from certain factories that were closed during 2016 amsterdam and delfzijl
netherlands baoying china bronby denmark one of the factories located in vilanova y la geltru
spain on the other hand the data includes the two french factories at neuf pre closed and cornimont
formerly xoulces  where production activities have changed considerably in addition the operating unit
dedicated solely to the production of wire rod has been excluded from the analysis
the environmental data for the production sites not included in this analysis is not thought to be significant
considering the low number of sites excluded with respect to the total 5 maximum and the limited extent
of production at those locations
environmental data is not yet reported in relation to the installation of terrestrial and submarine cables the
environmental aspects and methods of management differ greatly from those of the operating units since a
project is currently in progress for the future collection and reporting of representative indicators using
dedicated tools
the environmental performance indicators relating to energy greenhouse gas emissions waste water and
ozonedepleting substances have partly been derived from estimates in view of the deadlines for the
preparation of this report actual data might therefore be subject to insignificant changes
in this regard it is confirmed that the above data has been subjected to a reliability analysis at the time of
preparing this report the data from about 60 of our factories has been validated in full while validation of
the data from the other factories is still in progress due to the time required
in addition it is noted that production at the douvrin factory  required in order to quantify the environmental
indices per unit of product  has been quantified with reference to estimates

1 the information for the power cables category includes the telecom energy and accessories operating
units at the oulu factory available information relates to each factory as a whole the quantities produced
in relation to such information have been normalised so the telecom cables produced by the above
operating units are identified in weight terms rather than in km as in the telecom cables category


2 hazardous and nonhazardous waste the information for the power cables category includes combined
data for the telecom and energy operating units at the bishopstoke factory since this factory does not
accumulate separate details for each unit available information relates to the factory as a whole

3 water consumption and hazardous waste the information for the power cables category includes
combined data for the accessories and energy operating units at the gron factory since this factory does
not accumulate separate details for each unit available information relates to the factory as a whole

4 the information is significant at sector level in fact the quantity of ozonedepleting substances does
not relate to production activities and accordingly it is reported separately in total for the energy and
telecom sectors

5 for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters the volume of power cables produced
is expressed in tonnes being the sum of the weights of the cables produced in the years concerned and
the related compounds produced by prysmian excluding the compounds purchased in the marketplace
and simply added to the products

6 for the purpose of normalising the environmental parameters the production in km relates to finished
optical fibre excluding any semifinished fibre sold as such by the optical fibre factories considered in this
report

7 the production of telecom cables is expressed in km and obtained by summing the production of
cables made from optical fibre quantified in fibre km and with those made from copper quantified in pair
km the decision to use km rather than tonnes to quantify the total production of telecom cables was taken
due to the fact that the unit of measure expressed in length reflects the production process and the related
impact of environmental parameters more closely than the unit of measure of production expressed in
weight terms

8 only absolute amounts are reported for accessories since normalised units of production are not
available for this category in particular the nature of production included in this category various
considerably connectors for cables accessories for lifts etc
