                                the word local has two meanings for akkim the cities that our company operates in in
                                terms of employment and the within borders of turkey in terms of where we supply our raw
                                materials from
                                even though akkim does not have a specially designed local employment procedure we
                                prefer to contribute to local economies by employing people directly from the regions we
                                operate in
                                akkim purchases 50 of its raw and other materials from local suppliers and continues to
                                seek alternative local suppliers to increase the ratio in terms of contribution to the turkish
                                economy we find that this ratio is significant in our industry

     efficient use of raw materials
     employee opinion
     according to our sustainability survey 62 of our employees say
     measures and practices of akkim for efficient use of raw materials in
     production processes are satisfactory


                                                                                                       our environmental performance
     akkim performs all production operations in its integrated production facilities in other
     words outputs of a facility are used as raw material in another facility this brings us a
     considerable advantage in costs and competition for instance we not only produce and sell
     hydrogen peroxide but also use it as a raw material in another facility sodium percarbonate
     similarly we produce and sell methylamines but we also produce dimethylformamide by
     using these methylamines

     there are more than 20 facilities within akkim and all of these facilities have become
     operational under the leadership of akkims engineering team akkim has been exporting
     its knowhow and technologies to foreign companies since 2002 we also have a process
     development unit that benefits from the robust engineering infrastructure and team of
     akkim thanks to this unit we monitor efficiency of facilities make improvements where
     required and increase efficiency of raw materials with the changes made in processes the
     amount of scrap used in ferric iii chloride production increased this sets a good example for
     both the efficient use of raw materials and the reuse of waste materials

     akkim facilities also monitor raw material consumption with process control devices and
     improve processes when necessary

     raw materials and products are properly stored and checked regularly for shelf life thanks
     to the computerbased storage management system based upon the first in first out
     principle these storage center practices reduce the loss of raw materials

     among practices to involve employees in the resource use processes are including raw
     material efficiency into individual production goals training staff on raw material efficiency
     and giving instructions to improve raw material efficiency

     akkim has a variety of projects to reduce wastes for instance rd activities seek to
     ensure that activated alumina wastes used in hydrogen peroxide production are used in the
     ceramic industry as a raw material or as a concrete admixture when this project succeeds
     activated alumina wastes amounting to approximately 200 tonsyear will be recovered

     in addition personal scorecards of employees include targets for reducing wastes

     as a result of all these efforts approximately 265 tons of hazardous wastes and 550 tons
     of nonhazardous wastes were discharged at akkim facilities in 2013 furthermore 115
     tons of packaging wastes nylon and paper and 310 tons of contaminated packaging wastes

     development has an important role in akkims environmental practices akkim procures           akkim facilities domestic wastewater is delivered to the sewage system to be treated at
     the water used in its two factories in yalova from the gökçe dam and from aksa akrilik utility   the treatment facility of the municipality whereas the northern akkim uses the existing
     water is received directly from the dam the amount of utility water consumed may vary            wastewater treatment facility for domestic wastewater
     depending on the operational activities increase or decrease in production capacity etc
                                                                                                       northern akkim wastewater treatment facility is composed of physical treatment chemical
     process water is procured from two sources in the southern akkim facilities water from the     treatment biological treatment anaerobic nitrificationaerobic denitrification and sludge
     dam is softened before usage whereas in the northern akkim facilities water is received from    dewatering part the water treated there is then discharged in accordance with the limits
     aksa akrilik approximately 6065 of water used in processes becomes product component           stated in table 1412 of the water pollution control regulations issued by the ministry of
     and the rest becomes wastewater                                                                  environment and urbanization

     cooling water is taken from the dam and aksa akrilik and is used in a closed circuit system      southern akkim wastewater treatment facility uses physical and chemical treatment the
     thus water is added only when there is loss due to evaporationleakage                           water treated there is then discharged in accordance with the limits of the water pollution
                                                                                                       control regulations issued by the ministry of environment and urbanization table 19
     the water taken from the dam goes through a treatment system to be used as drinking water
                                                                                                       in addition 14500 m3year wastewater generated in the sodium percarbonate facility is
     in the production facilities in çerkezköy untreated water is procured from the well within the   recovered for reuse in the production system
     borders of akkim this untreated water is softened at the akkim facility and then used as
                                                                                                       consequently not only is water saving achieved but also the loss of products within the
     process water and in steam generation drinking water is outsourced
                                                                                                       wastewater is prevented similarly the water regained from cooling water is used in watering
     the employees are given periodical training on efficient use of water and water savings          green areas thus enabling approximately 6000 m3year water saving in the summer at ak
     recent projects enabled significant savings in the amount of water consumed                      kim yalova facilities a total of 248000 m3year wastewater was treated and disposed in 2013

     emissions of facilities are stored in absorbers of process funnels before going into the           washing at a rate of 40 degrees celsius instead of 60 would result in an estimated energy
     atmosphere and are refed into the system this way air quality is maintained resource use is    saving of 388 gwh per year in addition another important product is hydrogen peroxide
     reduced and chemicals are reused in addition organic steams are burned in the incinerator        which decomposes into oxygen and water after discharge
     system to avoid any environmental damage 1750 tonsyear steam power is generated
     during the incineration and this energy is used for the heating of corporate facilities

     air quality distribution modeling aims to identify how the polluters generated during our
     operations dust co nox sox voc etc may be dispersed in the working area under
     existing meteorological conditions and what may be the potential ground level precipitation
     of such pollutants

     during air pollution distribution modeling the distribution of air pollutants in the atmosphere
     are mathematically simulated by using parameters such as source data meteorological data
     land forms etc related computer programs analyze mathematical equalities and algorithms
     of pollutants akkim performs these practices within the coordination of management
     systems

     with a variety of emission measurement devices akkim makes internal measurements in
     emergencies or predefined periods and thus prevents environmental pollution by timely
     intervention in case of any problems
