the automotive sector takes its environmental responsibility very seriously while the vast majority
of the lifecycle emissions associated with a vehicle is from the inuse phase the industry has strived
to minimise the energy used to make its products not least because this also helps reduce costs and
improve competitiveness

manufacturing energy use

decc figures show vehicle manufacturing
accounts for around 4 of energy consumption
by all industry in the uk
within a vehicle manufacturing site the paint
shop boiler house and heatingventilation
account for some 65 of emissions the industry
has made great progress in reducing emissions
whilst the largest step changes can be made in
the paint shops and boilers these are the most
expensive operations to replace and have long
replacement cycles efficiency gains have also
been made using existing plant more effectively
for example optimising running times paint oven
controls or fan speeds as well as investing in
new equipment such as decentralised heating
systems replacing old boilers improved controls

   which were originally developed for use in formula 1 racing a high
   speed carbon fibre flywheel stores the energy generated as the vehicle
   slows and then uses it to power an electric motor to assist acceleration
   this generates fuel savings of more than 20 at a significantly lower
   cost than battery hybrid alternatives gkn hybrid power has already
