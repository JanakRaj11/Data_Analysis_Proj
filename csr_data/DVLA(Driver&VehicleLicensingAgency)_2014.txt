purpose of this document
this report details dvlas performance against the greening government commitments and
our overall sustainability performance it is intended to supplement the summary included in
the main body and annex a of dvlas annual report and accounts 20132014 the annex of
this report consists of detailed tables containing the minimum reporting requirements in
accordance with the hm treasury sustainability reporting guidance 201314 and the greening
government commitments guidance

boundary
the accounting boundary of this sustainability report matches the financial reporting
boundaries of the annual report it includes data related to our main site and the network
offices closed network office sites that we continue to hold the leases for are also included

pfi contract
whilst our pfi contract carries out business on our behalf for activities such as waste and
energy management we have assumed direct control of these for the purposes of annual
reporting this is mainly because we maintain financial responsibility for the paying of the utility
bills and have significant influence over how these activities are carried out

omissions estimates and amendments to prior periods
there are no known omissions in the data set provided where estimates have been used
andor amendments have been made to previously reported data these are noted in the
accompanying text

       greening government commitments



dvlas objectives and targets stem from the greening government commitments ggcs the
ggcs were set as a means to achieve the governments vision to have the greenest ever
operations and procurement with greater transparency on performance the commitments aim
to significantly reduce the governments negative impact on the environment through reducing
emissions of greenhouse gases reducing waste reducing water consumption and making public
procurement more sustainable the targets cover the period from 20092010 to 20142015
with the first year as the baseline measurement

  there has been a change to all previously reported figures for greenhouse gas emissions inline with current guidance from
defra concerning the recalculated conversion factors for electricity all conversion factors are now based on a single average
factor for the particular year previously a 5 year rolling average

whilst we are slightly behind on this years dft reduction target we are on track to meet the
three main greening government commitments which come to an end in 201415

the greenhouse gas emissions have further reduced over the past twelve months we
achieved a reduction of 77 this year above the 5 reduction expected

the energy saving measures we have implemented this year include

        installation of led lighting in areas to increase efficiency of energy use
        installation of thermal jacket insulation jackets on pipe work

plans and proposals for the coming year and beyond which will assist in the successful
achievement of the ggcs 20142015 25 reduction target include

        an assessment of the way in which we manage our energy across the whole estate
         including reviewing the way in which we utilise our chps

        further consideration for photovoltaic pv solutions for our whole estate

to keep on track with the 201415 ggc target our parent department dft set us the aim of
achieving a 20 reduction by this year from the baseline of 200910


we had only expected to achieve half of this target due to the programme of work to close our
local offices completed in december 2013 meant an increase in our business travel and dual
running of some of our operations however we exceeded our initial forecast with a 1525
reduction we believe that both the energy efficiency projects that have taken place on our
main site and the early release of some of the lsn site leases have assisted us in exceeding
where we planned to be the closure of our local office network has provided a significant
decrease in energy use and the full benefit of this restructure will be realised when all the
leases have come to an end

the chart above shows how we are improving the carbon efficiency of our business we began
by increasing our transactions whilst decreasing our ghg emissions it is our intention to
continue this trend with our plans for improving the efficiency of the estate and exploring
options for the use of renewable energy technology

   waste minimisation and management



during 201314 we continued to further reduce our waste and are on course to exceed our
20142015 waste minimisation targets we are likely to achieve in excess of a 40 reduction in
waste from the 200910 base line year

our biggest success with waste management this year was the significant amount of waste we
diverted from landfill with the closure of our local offices we reused as much as we could
within our agency what we couldnt reuse or store for future use we shared with other
government agencies charities community groups and schools not for profit organisations
start up businesses libraries and hospitals the data we have points to a minimum of 119
organisations benefiting from the donations and we can confidently estimate that over 90 of
potential waste from the office closures was diverted from landfill by being reused or recycled

       finite resource consumption


water use
we continue to achieve good practice consumption figures for our water consumption at 4m³
per fte good practice is between 46m³ per fte

however we are aware the overall water consumption on our main site is increasing despite
waterless urinals and low flow toilets this we believe is due to the increasing levels of staff due
to the dual operation running discussed earlier we are currently considering ways to reduce
water consumption further

to supplement the water we are supplied we also harvest rainwater at two of our sites this
year we collected 618 cubic metres which we use towards flushing our toilet facilities

administrative paper
a oneoff target was set across government to reduce administrative paper consumption in
20102011 by 10 from 20092010 levels the agency achieved a 47 reduction in 20112012
our consumption in this area has continued to fall with a 61 reduction from 20092010 levels
estimated for 201314

operational paper

dvla strategy to increase our digital services will mean a significant reduction in paper usage
for example we have estimated that the abolition of the tax disc and the move to direct debit
payment methods will save in excess of the equivalent of 50 million pieces of paper or
approximately 6000 trees per annum and estimated financial savings of nearly 167m over the
next 10 years for more information on this please refer to the business plan 2014 to 2015
other efficiency savings planned for the coming year are the abolition of the paper counterpart
driving licence and the option for fleet operators not to hold vehicle registration certificates
each will allow us to significantly reduce our volume of operational paper

  transparency commitments



the greening government commitments also include demonstrating transparency in related
matters the ggcs state that the government has committed to be open and transparent on
the areas below to increase accountability and to lead by example the following paragraphs
summarise some of the highlights of the work we are doing in each of the five areas of the
transparency commitments



sustainable procurement
all common goods and services are procured by the crown commercial service css acting as
a delivery agent on behalf of the agency the framework agreementscontracts established by
the ccs include a full range of sustainable products that meet the government buying
standards gbs the gbs are easytouse product specifications enabling public authorities to
develop tenders which procure sustainably
as part of preprocurement activity ie preparation for all procurement exercises including
common goods and services procured by the ccs the agency undertakes a sustainable risk
assessment on all requirements this assessment is intended to ensure that environmental
social and economic sustainability issues are assessed understood and managed in all key
commercial decisions that relate to the procurement of goods and services

at present we do not capture supply chain emissions but an essential part of the tender process
is to ensure that we are clear about the sustainable requirements we place on suppliers in
order to influence their performance in this area

climate change adaptation
our latest climate change risk assessment has identified just one major risk to our business a
potential flood risk at our swansea vale site the local council are currently carrying out
mitigating actions and as a business we have developed a continuity plan to ensure our
resilience against this possible impact

biodiversity and the natural environment
as an agency we have a legal requirement as well as a commitment under the ggcs to report
on and have regard to biodiversity encouraging and enhancing biodiversity not only has a
positive impact on the natural environment but also on dvla employees and our surrounding
neighbours quality of life through aspects including health and wellbeing

the agencys first biodiversity action plan was published in 201213 activities progressed this
year as part of the action plan include

      installing bird boxes on main site donated by our pfi service provider telereal trillium
       to encourage a larger bird population

      changing the grass cutting regime on 2 sites to allow a more natural growth pattern to
       exist

      changing the planting list to only allow planting of native species with a view to
       encouraging more wildlife

      undertaking a small mammal survey

      liaison with the south wales amphibian and reptile conservation trust to help improve
       the habitat surrounding our pond and conservation area


food and catering services
dvlas private finance initiative pfi contract with telereal trillium for food and catering
services is sub contracted to elior uk during 2013 elior uk were awarded platinum status in
the bitc corporate responsibility index 2013 for their focused commitment on sustainable
business practices

their new you  life scheme promotes healthy eating values and enables people to make
healthier choices by for example offering undressed salad bar choices and ensuring that low in
sugar and low in fat products including spreads baked beans mayonnaise and yoghurts are
used as standard

eliors procurement policy is based on supporting uk farmers and growers through a regional
and local supply chain and where they are unable to buy locally they take account of welfare

and sustainable guidelines such as marine conservation societys fish to eat and fish to
avoid lists and the red lion certification for eggs

more information on elior uk can be found on their website



sustainable construction
we have not engaged in any construction work during the last financial year all minor projects
have required waste to be recycled wherever possible



people


at dvla we are committed to being a responsible business and understand that we have a
responsibility to support the people that work with us and the communities in which we work

over the past year we have undertaken many activities to support our staff and communities
below is a snap shot of some of these


      health and well being

   the agency actively promotes a healthy lifestyle and has a focus on sustaining a healthy
   working environment in support of building a high performance culture and management
   the changing minds and fit for the future campaigns delivered a number of initiatives
   tailored to the needs of staff in support of physical and mental wellbeing our work on
   mental wellbeing has been showcased as best practice across the civil service and beyond
   with a case study on dvla featuring in the annual report of the good day at work
   wellbeing network

      volunteering

   the agency complies with our parent departments policy to allow staff to take paid special
   leave to volunteer the agency has not proactively endorsed any volunteering schemes but
   it will be reviewing its approach in this area over the next 12 months

   staff engagement

the civil service people survey 2013 produced an overall engagement score of 56 in
dvla this is an increase of 2 from the previous cs people survey held in 2012 while the
headline score showed a positive move some clear steps were identified to improve staff
engagement the agency has taken note of this feedback as well as that from the investors
in people reviews of 2010 and 2013 leading and managing were identified as our key driver
of engagement and much of the agencys planning has been focussed on these areas

   work experience

dvla completed its participation in the governments get britain working work placement
programme which is a programme designed to offer work experience to unemployed
people who are claiming job seekers allowance and who have volunteered for work
experience a total of 356 people participated in the programme and analysis undertaken
by dwp in 2013 revealed that 53 of these successfully found paid work some of which
were posts in dvla

   diversity

to increase our staffs representation from the black and minority ethnic bme job market
a number of activities have taken place a bme targeted job fair took place in december
attendees were encouraged to register onto civil service jobs with a view to applying for
dvla job opportunities in addition an ongoing work placement initiative primarily with
disabled support groups has been extended to bme support groups

   community

as part of our contribution to our local community the agency created a scheme called
getting swansea online these events were designed to help people who have little or no
experience of using the internet get hands on experience and support the agency teamed
up with a local school to help teach skills such as how to setting up email accounts learning
how to talk to friends and family across the internet and uploading and sending digital
photos

this year has also seen staff nominate a local charity of choice to receive the fruits of our
fundraising efforts the first charity to be supported is the wales air ambulance with the
first few events raising over 5000 for the charity
