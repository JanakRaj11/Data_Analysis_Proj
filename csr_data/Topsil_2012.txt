worth slightly dkk 7 billion according independent industry analyst yole developpement power market target mainly energy transport industrial medical telecommunication sector characterised high high medium high voltage component manufacture ultrapure silicon extremely complex therefore handful company world supply including topsil topsils ultrapure silicon used raw material component used conducting controlling electricity one point another minimum loss power silicon sold wafer used eg highspeed train wind turbine industrial motor control power grid today three quarter topsils product end clean tech application may defined product involved energy saving energy efficiency driven globally increasing energy consumption increasing investment transport energy control power market seen good growth rate recent year yole developpement foresees market growth continue year come especially within medium voltage segment despite overall favourable trend 2011 however impacted change political focus major economy driven ongoing financials challenge resulting pronounced caution concerning new investment since foundation topsil located denmark hq polish subsidiary cemat acquired
