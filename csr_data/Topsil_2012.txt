  2011
  in the past year topsil continued the journey towards a more sustainable existence we
  are looking forward to completing our new production plant this year that will include a
  number of environmentally sound solutions for the manufacture of ultrapure silicon we
  are moreover pleased to see that our equipment to recycle grinding water purchased late
  2010 considerably lowered our hq water consumption 2011

   topsil in brief

   topsil was founded by haldor tops√∏e in 1958 focusing on innovation technology and process
   optimisation topsil is today among the worlds leading enterprises in the development and production of
   ultrapure silicon addressing the power market and other selected niche markets in the semiconductor
   industry by the end of 2010 topsils markets were worth slightly more than dkk 7 billion according to
   independent industry analyst yole developpement

   the power market targets mainly the energy transport industrial medical and telecommunications
   sectors and is characterised by very high high and medium high voltage components the manufacture
   of ultrapure silicon is extremely complex and therefore only a handful of companies in the world can
   supply it including topsil

   topsils ultrapure silicon is used as raw material in components used for conducting and controlling
   electricity from one point to another with a minimum loss of power silicon which is sold in wafers is
   used in eg highspeed trains wind turbines industrial motor controls and the power grid today about
   three quarters of topsils products end up in clean tech applications which may be defined as products
   that are involved with energy savings or energy efficiency

   driven by globally increasing energy consumption and increasing investments in transport and energy
   control the power market has seen good growth rates in recent years yole developpement foresees that
   market growth will continue in the years to come especially within the medium voltage segments
   despite the overall favourable trends 2011 however was impacted by the change of political focus in
   most major economies driven by the ongoing financials challenges resulting in pronounced caution
   concerning new investment

   since its foundation topsil has been located in denmark hq and polish subsidiary cemat was
   acquired 2008 cemat specialises in manufacturing silicon of less purity than that of topsil for the
   medium and low voltage levels furthermore it has the equipment and expertise necessary to conduct
   silicon wafering which has enabled topsil to transfer some of this previously externally conducted activity
   to cemat

   new plant in cleantech park

   in order to accommodate overall favourable market trends and to meet customer demands on product
   development steadily tighter quality limits lower cost and shorter lead times topsil is building new
   future proof facilities in copenhagen cleantech park close to the existing headquarters

   the construction will be completed in 2012 and the new plant will include a number of environmentally
   sound solutions in addition to boosting capacity and enabling larger diameter wafers supporting topsils
   entry into additional markets among others the new location serves as a statement of topsils
   progressing commitment to the environment clean technology and energy effectiveness

   the construction phase of the new plant will be completed h1 2012 after which a gradual transfer of
   technology of people from the existing headquarters will commence


   forecast financials 2011

   topsil 2011 forecast revenue amounts to in the range of dkk 370m 2010 amounted to dkk 4567
   forecast ebitda is dkk 35m 2010 amounted to dkk 1020m

   at the end of 2011 topsil had 367 employees

   approach to corporate social responsibility



   stakeholder focus

   topsil has divided the main stakeholder groups into two types of spheres please see below the 2011
   activities have primarily but not exclusively concerned the sphere of control




   framework

   topsils aggregated csr framework appears below it is based on the fact that 75 of topsils products
   end up in clean tech devices combined with identified strategic issues within the sphere of control as
   well as other important issues that as a minimum require our continuous attention and compliance with
   applicable legal standards
