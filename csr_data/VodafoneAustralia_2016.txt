the vodafone village  milan italy

the vodafone village in italy is the worlds
largest leed for commercial interiors
leedci certified building built on the site of
a former factory in an unused industrial area
in milan the 127000 square metre building
has played a major part in the environmental
rehabilitation of the local area and produces
more than 8000 kwh of clean solar energy
each year from its 800 square metre rooftop
photovoltaic array this highly efficient leedci
silvercertified building is designed to maximise
natural light it contains 3000 workstations
a lecture theatre a nursery a learning centre
with training rooms a cafeteria and ample
cycle parking and shower facilities to support
more sustainable commuting by staff
the building has achieved a 30 reduction
in water use by installing lowflow mixer taps
careful landscaping and irrigation and a 25
decrease in energy consumption through
new lighting controls and efficient appliances
more than 70 of electrical equipment and
appliances are energy star qualified and
more than 20 of the materials and furniture
used in the building were sourced locally
an advanced double skin airflow system on
the external façade allows the building to
maintain a constant temperature reducing
energy consumption for heating and cooling
a variety of informal meeting areas a rooftop
garden and outdoor green spaces have also
been incorporated to enhance staff wellbeing

connecting smart meters in spain

edp hc energía  one of spains leading
energy providers  has installed more than
450000 smart meters in homes across spain
to help people to reduce their energy use



650000
smart meters will be installed in
homes across spain to help
householders reduce energy use
the meters will enable customers to see
how much energy they are using in real
time adjusting their consumption as needed
and as a consequence reducing both costs
and emissions
edp hc energías smart meters rely on our
iot technology to allow meter readings to be
taken remotely at any time estimated bills are
no longer necessary nor are meter reading
visits reducing the companys operating costs
and travelrelated emissions in addition
sensors in the meters connected to our iot
technology help edp hc energía identify
faults remotely without dispatching engineers

extending access to education
in south africa

during 201516 we launched the vodacom
eschool programme in south africa to
extend the range of teaching materials
and techniques available for students from
all backgrounds
the educational online portal supports students
in all major subjects from grades four to 12
endorsed by the south african department of
basic education vodacom eschool supports
the standard school syllabus but also adds new
and engaging material which takes advantage
of mobile technology
all materials are accessible at no cost via a
smartphone including free data access for
vodacom south africa customers within six
months of launch vodacom eschool had
passed the 100000 user milestone



we know that many learners in our
 country often do not have access
 to learning materials which makes
 excelling at school more difficult
 through this platform we can help
 address this challenge our goal is to
 ensure that learners throughout the
 country have access to some basic
 tools to help enhance their learning
 outside of the classroom

thank you is enough campaign in ghana

in ghanaian culture it is common to provide a
small amount of cash as a tip or gift for good
service in a number of environments beyond
a restaurant where tipping is commonplace
globally including in the retail stores operated
by vodafone while receiving small amounts of
money after good customer service would not
appear at face value to be a significant bribery
and corruption risk we concluded that this
small gesture of courtesy by our customers
 although clearly wellintentioned  was not
consistent with our policy of not offering or
accepting cash gifts
vodafone ghanas thank you is enough
campaign was designed to spread the message
among employees customers and communities
that a simple expression of gratitude  not a
cash gift  was all that would ever be expected
by anyone working for vodafone in order to
protect both employees and customers against
any perceived impropriety
