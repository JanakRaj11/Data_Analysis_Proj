verification of csr key issues and responses
to changing social requirements
          the daiwa securities group recognizes that we are responsible as a member of society to various stakeholders when selecting
          key csr issues meanwhile social requirements for companies may change over time and we need to constantly verify
          whether significant changes are occurring and whether our key issues accommodate these changes
             we believe social requirements for corporations from a wide range of stakeholders have become increasingly diversified and
          thus more complex to reconcile and that it has become more important than ever to take a balanced approach in considering
          these diverse demands
             in light of these circumstances the daiwa securities group has actively participated in external csr initiatives in japan and
          overseas and promoted activities that use various codes in order to identify properly and respond to corporate csr trends the
          following are codes that we place a special emphasis on

          maintaining a balance with creation of shareholder value
          in promoting csr activities we place a great emphasis on initiatives through business activities such initiatives help solve social
          issues and at the same time generate commission and fee revenuetangible value for shareholders moreover a cut in energy costs
          achieved as a result of initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint of our business activities is also an example of such value
             value for shareholders is not limited to matters that are easy to gauge such intangible value for our shareholders
          includes trust given to us by customers a rise in morale of employees and improvement in corporate governance and
          compliance systems
             while csr activities generate tangible and intangible value for stakeholders and shareholders they also incur costs as
          with other business activities due to the limitations of human and other resources csr activity costs may grow rapidly
          when the volume of activities increases we consider it important to analyze the costeffectiveness of our csr activities
          whilst working on reducing their costs in assessing value for shareholders

                                          father of value investing and securities settlement

          fujimoto bill broker bank one of the predecessors of the
          daiwa securities group imported government bonds issued
          by the uk and france during world war i when their prices
          plunged this paved the way for the companys expansion of
          overseas operations
             in 1919 when the versailles treaty was signed fujimoto sent
          representative officers to new york that was because fujimoto
          at that time realized that there would be great demand in
          japan for bonds issued by the japanese government overseas
          at the time of japaneserusso war to raise funds for war
          because the price of those bonds had plunged providing an
          opportunity to gain high yields however the denominations of
          those japanese government bonds were small making them                       bonds that arrived at the fujimoto bill broker bank headquarters
          extremely cumbersome to settle involving purchasing them
          in overseas markets and transporting them to japan one of
          the people who became the banks partners at that time was
          a young benjamin graham who is now called the father of
          value investing he later described securities settlement and
          other transactions with fujimoto and his interchange with the

       in 1986 daiwa securities began a service enabling investors to place stock trading orders through personal
       computers for the first time in japan thereafter we also introduced services using the internet1 and
       cellphones2 ahead of other companies
          we believe that a service providing investment information and allowing the placement of trading orders
       anytime anywhere is useful especially for retail customers in trading of securities whose prices constantly
       change on the market
          due to the recent widespread use of wifi services and smartphones more and more customers are
       obtaining and analyzing information and placing trading orders with their own devices we expect this
       trend to accelerate further down the road accordingly we will use stateoftheart technology to make
       our services easier to use and thereby improve customer convenience while striving to further offer
       valuable investment information
          in fy2014 we implemented a service related to nisa a new investment program while starting a service
       for smartphone users at daiwa next bank ltd in fy2015 we plan a major redesign of our website moreover
       daiwa securities offers a service enabling customers to receive facetoface consulting along with online
       services we thereby differentiate ourselves from internetonly securities companies at daiwa securities we
       will further enhance our customer services to become a securities company chosen by customers

dialogue with stakeholders in regions affected by great east japan earthquake



    four years have passed since the great east japan earthquake
    some people have noted that many disasteraffected regions
    already faced various issues such as aging population and
    depopulation which were aggravated further by the disaster
    meanwhile the aging population presents challenges in many
    other parts of japan and is expected to also affect many other
    countries the daiwa securities group believes that efforts to
    address these social issues in the disasteraffected regions will
    have significant implications when considering broader social                                                   interaction at a joint workshop
    initiatives in the future
       in light of this view the group is identifying social challenges
    currently faced in the disasteraffected regions and considering
    what we can do for them through visits to the nonprofit
    organizations npos active in disasteraffected regions to
    which daiwa securities phoenix japan program has provided
    support and dialogue at joint workshops under the program

   major opinions from npo staff and organizations
                                                                                                                                  with ngo staffs
   receiving support

                            the biggest problem faced by regional cities is falling population human resource shortages have
                              made them unable to promote regional industries and improve welfare
             issues          postdisaster reconstruction work is expected to be substantially cut raising concerns over the
                           
             raised         impact of the downscaling of regional economies
                            some of the issues in disasteraffected regions are social challenges common in other parts of
                              japan but we should remember that some are particularly noticeable in those regions including
                              psychological care and the double loan problem
                            in some cases support from municipalities is reduced once a profitmaking business is launched
                              this adversely affects the finances of organizations assisting reconstruction efforts
                            since prior to the disaster these regions had few experts in child welfare and medical care and
                              received little governmental support accordingly in many cases children fail to be protected by
                              support safety nets and this issue has become particularly noticeable following the disaster
                            we would like to increase the number of participants in support activities to promote interaction
                              with disasteraffected regions but we do not know how to


                            thanks to npo activities as well as volunteer work by people coming from other areas after the
                              disaster the affected regions have started incorporating opinions from third parties especially from
           findings           younger people
                            efforts to address social issues in disasteraffected regions may be communicated nationwide as a
                              new model
                            daiwa securities phoenix japan program which is designed to develop human resources is unique
                              among corporate programs providing financial support to disasteraffected regions
                            npos would like to incorporate the problemsolving abilities and knowhow on organization
                              management that companies possess


    initiatives to be taken by the daiwa securities group
    we will extend the scope of support under daiwa securities phoenix japan program to groups aiming to address social
    issues that have worsened since the disaster not just organizations engaging in postreconstruction efforts through
    joint workshops and meetings with the organizations we support we will increase opportunities that help deal with their
    concerns and challenges moreover in order to assist efforts to revitalize regional economies we will continue investing in
    unlisted companies in disasteraffected regions through a fund managed by daiwa corporate investment
