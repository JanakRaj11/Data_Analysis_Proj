sustainability priorities
materiality
this report addresses business operations over which we have control which means the five facilities we
own and occupy the 27 freight trucks we own and the 120 forklifts we operate on a daytoday basis
the subject matter included in the report covers what we think is most relevant to our business

         energy direct energy consumed by our trucks and forklifts indirect energy consumed by the
         facilities we own and operate and solar energy generated by the panels on our roofs

         water municipallysupplied water consumed by our plumbing and irrigation systems and water
         runoff from our roofs and roadways

         materials  resources purchases and disposal of office supplies furniture electronics
         packaging etc

         people the safety health and wellbeing of our employees as well as our place in
         the community

this report does not address material factors over which we do not have control the energy consumed
by the thousands of trucks that we do not own serving our warehouses the impact of our leased
facilities or the upstream and downstream supply chain effects of the products we warehouse




    2013 highlights

    in eagan mn this included beginning the leed certification process and investing
       in high efficiency mechanical and electrical systems to lower operating costs

                                   murphys innovative stormwater system




our goals
within the context of our overarching goal of being a good corporate citizen murphy has three concrete
goals as it relates to our owned and operated facilities and their corresponding impact on the environment


                                                                                                        2013 performance
              greenhouse gas emissions
              emit less than 50 of the national average for similar
              size and type facilities this involves not only undertaking                                         38
              energy efficiency measures but also encompasses carbon                                         greenhouse gas
              sequestration and other activities we can do at sites or other                                emissions compared
              land we own                                                                                      to average


              energy
              increase the percent of our electricity generated through
              renewable sources this means continuing to invest in energy
                                                                                                                   79
              efficient technologies so that the clean electricity generated                               electricity generated
              from the sun will account for a greater proportion of our                                       from solar power
              consumption so far weve increased our percentage from
              42 in 2011 to 71 in 2012 to 79 in 2013


              water
              reduce water consumption by 25 from the 2010 baseline
              in 2010 murphy had its first two facilities leed certified                                        225
              under the leed for existing buildings operations                                                reduction from
              maintenance rating system and this further catapulted us into                                     2010 baseline
              seeing the benefits of taking a holistic view of our operations




                   murphy has already reached two out of three of our
              sustainability goals and is well on its way to meeting the third
the following pages will address the management approach strategies and tactics murphy utilizes to
help realize these goals




                                                                                                                                                    5

management approach
any investment we make in our business has financial implications both on the front end for cash flow
and for ongoing operational expenses our approach is always measured with an eye toward taking
advantage of opportunities to save money improving the environment and providing amazing service
to our customers we have high standards for quality and we do that through constant vigilance of our
operations we go the extra mile and invest in thirdparty certification in several areas




                   leadership in energy and environmental design leed was developed
                   by the us green building council as a voluntary consensusbased program that
                   provides education metrics and verification for high performance green buildings
                   leed establishes performance criteria in the areas of site energy water indoor air
                   quality and materials and resources

                   murphy has leed certified its central campus silver both 4700 and 4850
                   campuses in fridley gold is concluding the certification of its eagan campus
                   gold and is embarking on one of the first recertifications under the leed for
                   building operations and maintenance om rating system for its fridley locations
                   once the eagan certification is complete murphy will have over 12 million square
                   feet of leed certified warehouses in the minneapolisst paul metro area




                   energy star is a us environmental protection agency voluntary program that
                   helps businesses save money by tracking their energy and water usage energy star
                   certification can be granted to buildings that perform at the 75th percentile or higher
                   compared with similar buildings murphy facilities have consistently scored in the
                   top percentiles




                   iso 9001 is a series of standards developed and published by the international
                   organization for standardization iso that define establish and maintain an
                   effective quality assurance system for manufacturing and service industries the iso
                   9001 standard is the most widely known and has perhaps had the most impact of the
                   13000 standards published by the iso and covers all murphy operated facilities


                   iso 14001 standard requires measurable performance goals targets and
                   objectives for the company and for each individual environmental aspect and impact
                   process murphy is committed to maintaining this standard annually




       with the completion of certification at
    our eagan facility murphy will own nearly        4         of the total leed omcertified
                                                                 square footage in minnesota

management approach
maintaining the internationallyrecognized third party certifications of leed energy star iso 9001 and
iso 14001 are a key component of our overall business strategy why

leadership as a fourth generation familyowned business we believe sustainability is important
for our future and our communitys we have been taking a leadership role and will continue to do so
because we believe its the right thing to do

thirdparty verification in the operations and maintenance of our facilities we already do most
things required by the governing bodies of leed energy star and iso 14001 third party verification
continues to hold us accountable to these high standards

business strategy major corporations are starting to require that their supply chain partners go
green certification shows them that we are listening and responding to their current and future needs

marketing murphy has been consistently listed among the top 50 green supply chain partners and
has been featured in numerous business magazines case studies and television this kind of exposure
opens up new opportunities to grow the business and educate others on how to be sustainable

return on investment roi our investments have been paying off in reduced operating
expenses allowing us to reinvest in our company




evaluation of management approach
murphy approaches each of these certifications not as an ironclad principle but as investments that
make sense for example in 2013 murphys main headquarters in minneapolis went through the process
of leed certification although we accomplished most aspects of the leed requirements the age of the
buildings required investments that were not feasible at this time

for each material aspect that is discussed in the following pages we describe why it matters and how
we manage the impacts our management approach undergoes continuous evaluation through internal
executive level review additionally to ensure our management approach resonates with our customers
and the marketplace the director of customer service the vp of business development and client
relations and the vp of transportation send out customer surveys every other year to

   1 determine customer satisfaction
   2 obtain a measurable indicator of the customers perception of the warehousing and distribution
      services they receive
   3 evaluate certain areas of interest for murphy
for quality assurance any customer survey rating of three or less on a scale of five is followed up and
recorded in our online quality system




              murphy has consistently achieved above average to exceptional
                  ratings from our customer service satisfaction surveys




                                                                                                            7

energy efficiency
energy conservation is by far the single greatest opportunity to reduce our dependence on fossil
fuels and decrease carbon emissions becoming more energy efficient is not just a onetime initiative
looking for ways to reduce energy consumption is an ongoing endeavor and as technology improves
murphy continues to be on the cutting edge


            murphy electricity         in 2013 we have accomplished energy

renewable energy
energy conservation can only take us so far toward
reducing our reliance on fossil fuels renewable energy
 specifically solar energy  can take us even further


solar power
murphy has been working hard toward achieving
our goal of increasing our percentage of electricity
generated by renewable sources by utilizing our
large flat roofs for solar panels to date we have
installed 326 kw of solar power guided by the state
of minnesota and utility company programs we have
achieved this by installing a series of 40 kw arrays
on our owned buildings this includes multiple 40 kw         what do these systems do

water efficiency
murphy continues to take strides to become more efficient in our operations while our operations do
not utilize a great amount of water we recognize that water is a precious resource

our goal is to reduce water consumption by 25 below the 2010 baseline

there are two primary components of water usage plumbing fixtures and irrigation therefore there are
two strategies to accomplish this goal
      upgrade plumbing flow and flush fixtures to lowflow
      reduce irrigation through investing in
           landscape that requires less irrigation such as native prairies
           highefficiency irrigation systems that sense current conditions and forecast weather patterns

stormwater management
stormwater runoff is a major source of water pollution conventional logistics campuses are made up of
vast amounts of impervious surfaces such as roofs and pavement these hard surfaces known as gray
infrastructure present a problem during major rainfall events because large volumes of stormwater can
overwhelm and damage storm sewers this often requires expensive infrastructure upgrades to reduce
volume and improve water quality moreover processing water takes a significant amount of energy
producing more greenhouse gas emissions and higher municipal taxes and fees

                                                          realizing the significant contribution that
                                                          the logistics industry makes to regional and
    main headquarters                                     national stormwater challenges murphy has
    before 2008 nearly 100 of stormwater                made an ambitious investment in reducing
    occurring at our headquarters in minneapolis          its stormwater impact murphys strategy
    was running offsite since implementing              has been to invest in green infrastructure
    these strategies we retain nearly 100 of            which uses environmentallyfriendly
    our stormwater onsite for major storm                techniques to manage stormwater these
    events because of this we no longer pay a           investments include
    stormwater fee to the city of minneapolis
    these infrastructure upgrades will pay for
    themselves in less than 7 years and continue
    to save us 73000 annually

                                                          runoff and eliminate contaminants

                                                          stormwater retention is based upon how
                                                          much water the property will absorb on site

                                                          it requires complex civil engineering analysis
                                                          at our 4700 and 4850 fridley facilities we

biodiversity
biodiversity is the variety of life in the world or in a particular habitat or ecosystem why is biodiversity
important everything that lives in an ecosystem is part of the web of life including humans each
species of vegetation and each creature has a place on the earth and plays a vital role maintaining a
wide diversity of species in each ecosystem is necessary to preserve the web of life that sustains all
living things

most logistics campuses devote a majority of their site
to storage and transportation paying little attention to
green space and biodiversity these sites are typically
surrounded by thin strips of turf grass weeds aggregate
and very few trees which are often neglected or require
high maintenance in contrast murphy has chosen to
maximize the utility of its green space with biodiversity
by planting native prairie landscapes which provide
ecological services such as promoting biodiversity the
purification of water and air pollination and importantly
carbon sequestration in plants


native landscape
in 1994 murphy installed its first native prairie in fridley               native prairie vs lawn
today all of our campuses have been planted with                              4700  4850 campuses

transportation
murphy owns and operates 27 longhaul
trucks these trucks travel an average
of between 150 and 450 miles per day
consuming diesel fuel at a rate of 65 miles
per gallon

recognizing that logistics requires
energy we do what we can to be as
efficient as possible in our own logistical
operations our strategies for reducing the
environmental impact of our operations are


retrofitting our trucks         increasing                      locating our facilities near
and trailers to reduce          our usage of

greenhouse gas emissions
greenhouse gas emissions can result from direct and indirect consumption  or burning  of fossil fuels
murphy reports on both our direct greenhouse gas emissions from utilizing our 27 dieselpowered
trucks and 95 propanepowered forklifts the other 25 forklifts are electricpowered and our indirect
greenhouse gas emissions from heating cooling and ventilating our warehouses

murphy wants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions because its simply the right thing to do but there
are other benefits as well as we reduce carbon emissions we are reducing pollutants  such as carbon
dioxide nitrous oxide and methane  in addition to helping reduce smog and fine particulate matter

because murphys indirect emissions from
warehouse operations contribute about twice
the amount of greenhouse gas emissions as do
operating our trucks and forklifts combined
murphy prioritizes its corporatewide goals on
measuring and managing our facilities

murphys goal is to be under 50 of the
national median for indirect greenhouse gas
emissions for similar facilities as measured by
the epas portfolio manager online tool

opportunity
we plan to stay ahead of the game in our industry as more customers are looking to green their supply
chain we are here for them because we are investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy we are
lowering our operating costs while helping reduce greenhouse gases

risk
climate change presents regulatory and physical risks for our business operations from a regulatory
standpoint a carbon tax would have financial implications to our bottom line it could also affect our
customers and our own ability to transport goods we believe our central locations and access to
rail lines are important risk  mitigating factors we also continue to invest in our long haul trailers to
improve their fuel efficiency

from a physical standpoint our locations are not near shorelines and our facilities are not that
vulnerable as a logistics company that serves the entire united states however any weatherrelated
disaster on either coast affects our business to manage this risk we continue to diversify across
industries and customers

we view our efforts here as risk mitigation the most recent legislation enacted in 2013 has not been
discussed much but businesses are getting closer to having to pay for carbon emissions the more we
can reduce our carbon footprint the better off we are financially especially compared with
our competition

materials  resources
material selection plays a significant role in sustainable building operations the life cycle of a material
 extraction processing transportation use and disposal  can have negative health and environmental
consequences murphy has adopted environmentally responsible procurement and waste management
policies that can significantly reduce these impacts


purchasing
by showing preference for products with recycled content we are doing our part to expand markets
for recycled materials slow the consumption of raw materials and reduce waste entering landfills in
2013 we formally established a corporatewide sustainable purchasing policy for all of our campuses
this means we try to meet thresholds established for purchasing products with recycled content rapidly
renewable content are rechargeable or are thirdparty certified


                                     waste management
                                     at murphy we are reducing the quantity of waste generated
                                     through responsible procurement practices our goal is to manage
                                     solid waste in a manner that will
                                      minimize landfilling andor incineration and reduce toxicity
                                      protect the environment and public health
                                      conserve natural resources
                                     the nature of our business is such that we encounter a great deal of
                                     packaging materials coming in to our warehouses while we cannot
                                     avoid that we can make a difference in where those materials end
                                     up through efforts like extensive cardboard metal and plastic
                                     recycling along with the use of starchbased packing peanuts we
                                     are able to divert more than 99 of the ongoing consumables we
                                     use daily in the office and warehouse from going into the landfill

reuse
our commitment to reuse is further exemplified by several standard murphy policies




        utilize        donate            reuse               100 reuse of
     refurbished        used          rechargeable        shipping pallets and
