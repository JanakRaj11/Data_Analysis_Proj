                   the intention of fujitsu
                   our world faces many challenges relating to population growth these include the security of supply of energy other
                   resources and food climate change the increasing frequency of natural disasters and loss of biodiversity these social and
                   environmental issues are deeply interconnected and they cannot be managed in isolation society expects businesses to
                   proactively take actions to address these challenges

                   deploying information and communications technology ict in an intelligent manner can improve the efficient use of

              information to save energy                                             from wastewater
              companies that have already spent many years reducing their            as copper mines have penetrated deeper and deeper into the
              environmental burden find it difficult to identify additional          earth in recent years the waste and the amount of energy
              areas for improvement fujitsu is working to save energy               needed for refinement have increased giving rise to concerns
              through the use of its environmental management                        about environmental burden resource reuse therefore is
              dashboard a tool that visually represents energy usage in             now more important than ever
              real time we use the environmental management dashboard                    at fujitsus nagano plant we are working to recover
              inhouse and have begun to provide it to customers as well           copper from the large amounts of sludge1 that are produced
                    fujitsu isotec limited fit which manufactures personal        from the processing of industrial wastewater chemicals used
              computers pc servers and printers had already implemented           for wastewater processing however bind with copper particles
              various energysaving measures mainly for its manufacturing           making it difficult to recover copper in high concentrations
              facilities and was finding it harder and harder to achieve                  we therefore have begun to replace the coagulating
              additional energy savings of consequence                              sedimentation treatment that uses the problematic chemicals
                    adopting the environmental management dashboard                 with a new wastewater treatment system that uses a functional
              however has made it possible for fit to know exactly from visual     powder that provides high filtering efficiency since implementing
              representations how much energy it is using not on an entire         this new system in june 2012 we have been able to recover high
              plant basis but by production line production process and even      concentrations of very fine copper particles coppercontaining
              product now it knows how much energy it is using at particular        sludge has been improved to a concentration of 9095 from
              times and in particular areas the energy management                   15 before the amount of sludge from chemical treatment has
              dashboard shows fit for example when it is using additional          been reduced to 5 tons per month only 17 what it was before
              energy even though production volume has not increased and             and money spent on chemicals has fallen by 548 million yen
              how much electricity is being used even on days off when there             at present we are aiming to use this new system for
              are no production activities with this knowledge in hand fit can     about 10 of the total wastewater from the nagano plant
              seek the causes of inefficiency and develop and implement new         with plans to gradually increase this figure looking to the
              energysaving measures in a pdca cycle                                future fujitsu will continue to actively promote resource reuse
                    because individual employees can check the energy                and reduction of waste generation

                                            when thinking about the diversity of human assets it is important to view differences in nationality ethnicity gender
                                            and other attributes as part of each persons individuality doing so enables appropriate placement of personnel
                                            without being swayed by nationality or gender support for activity by women too should be considered on the
