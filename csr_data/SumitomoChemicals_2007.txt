  sumitomo ssbr solution polymerization styrene butadiene rubber

as the worldwide momentum toward resource conservation and environmental preser
vation grows consumers awareness of the need for energy efficiency and safety in
driving is rising the performance required of tires has grown increasingly sophisticated
with each passing year in terms of fuel efficiency and safety in particular the role of
roadgripping tire treads is significant and enhanced functions are required
      sumitomo ssbr solution polymerization styrene butadiene rubber is used for
tire treads as a synthetic rubber material that can simultaneously improve the two often
opposing characteristics of fuel cost saving energy conservation and brake
performance safety

for technical development for 2006 for its development                            under construction for the rabigh project
and commercialization of its new propylene oxide process
the award ceremony took place at kansai university in
osaka in march 2007
     propylene oxide is traditionally manufactured using
the propylene oxideonly process using chlorine which
generates chlorides or by a coproduction process that
generates styrene monomer making the production of pro
pylene oxide subject to fluctuations in the styrene market
the new process adopts the new concept of recycling
cumene enabling the production of propylene oxide alone
without generating byproducts and coproducts the use
of highperformance catalysts in this process has achieved
high product yields the process is also a green process
that achieves resource and energy conservation through
the effective use of reaction heat recovered in each rele
vant step of the manufacturing process

             introduction of environmental efficiency indicators
             the sumitomo chemical group has been aggregating the environmental impact of its activities and study
             ing ways of assessing relationships between production efficiency the cost of environmental activities
             and environmental impact through these studies we are attempting to develop environmental efficiency
             indicators that will enable us to reduce the environmental impact of our activities more effectively


      studies toward practical application of environmental efficiency indicators using jepix1

since wastewater generated from manufacturing plants pro             there are now fewer plants at the oita works that consume
cess wastewater is contaminated with a large quantity of              large quantities of energy and this has caused a decline in the
organic matter it is not possible to discharge it into public         operational efficiency of the boilers supplying energy steam

concentration of organic contaminants in highconcentration            ing the boilers of sumitomo chemical and oji paperboard with
organic wastewater allowing us to switch successfully from            12 km of piping through which sumitomo chemical uses the
incineration processing to activated sludge processing as a           lowpressure steam that oji paperboard has used for power
result the fuel that had previously been used for incineration        generation energy savings and the difference between the
