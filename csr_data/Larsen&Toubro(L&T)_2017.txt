    a water conservation campaign with
    the bhatpara municipality jagaddal
    police station and local panghat
    club the team conducted awareness
    sessions on the value of water and
    encouraged locals in the area to use
    water efficiently the municipality
    had installed drinking water taps for
    the locals but some of them were
    either stolen or damaged leading to
    wastage the company repaired the
    existing taps and saved up to 3800
    litres of water per day

blanketing soil to lay tracks the area around it had a      thereby creating a winwin situation for both parties
considerable overburden and limited amount of good soil       the soil collection process created large mine pits which
as the ground hits hard rock five to six meters below the    could be converted into water storage reservoirs this

the company had a choice to either purchase soil from         value and reservoirs which they could not have created
areas closeby or from a distant location which adds to       by themselves
the transportation costs if they were to use soil from the
vicinity it meant additional procurement efforts as it had   result
to be gathered from many farms the land owners in the
area are farmers with large farmlands yet they lacked       the intervention led to storage of rainwater in reservoirs
water all year round and had no access to rivers or canals   which is now used for growing crops like wheat and
to cater to farmland requirements                            rice these reservoirs are part of individual farmlands and
                                                              water is directly pumped for irrigation the soil is fertile
the only available source of water was the monsoon            and hence indias best quality wheat is now cultivated
showers monsoons brought in a good amount of                 in the region the area now harvests up to two crops a
rainfall yet the water could not be stored and used for      year improving its prosperity more than 39 reservoirs
agriculture this situation restricted income from farming    were created which are filled once a year holding more
as it could only support one crop a year and that too        than 1159 million liters of water this transformed the
crops like chana which do not require large amounts of        lives of villagers making it a defining case of bringing

at lt we have recognized effective waste management as a key part of environment management we reduce reuse
and recycle waste generated at our project sites to cut down our environmental impact and carbon footprint we have
measures in place to eliminate and contain spills and regularly report on waste and spills as part of iso 14001 and ohsas

   effective use of rundown water

   hand pumps are a primary source of drinking water but have many disadvantages including wastage
   traditionally workmen at sites use it to wash their hands and themselves before they drink water resulting
   in a lot of water rundown and waterlogging


   a water storage tank of 30 m3 capacity was constructed with waste concrete 68 m3 near a hand pump with a
   slope provided towards the tank as people use the water at the pump the rundown water is collected in the tank
   this water is then reused for curing of fresh concrete and cover blocks and for settling dust through sprinkling
   over and above water conservation the initiative also ensured that the areas near hand pumps remained free of
   collected water and saved manpower needed to clear waterlogging

cement collectors improve air quality
and health

 at our power project sites ground mounted cement collectors are used to collect cement reduce pollution and
 improve air quality cement collectors are installed at batching plants to separate cement particles that flow
 out using filtering elements made of fabric polyester as the dusty air flows through the cement collector and
 the filter it separates cement particles the cement accumulated on the filter elements surface is periodically
 removed by reverse air jet cleaning system with compressed air it facilitates cement collection while moderating
 risk in maintenance apart from being a costeffective solution


 these centralized ground mounted cement collector units help protect workforce and society from exposure to
 cement particles reducing associated health issues it also helps recover cement reduce wastage and enhance
 improve air quality


 we have installed ground mounted cement collectors at nine power project sites for
 17 batching plants which collect on an average one percent of cement fed to the silos

risk of a soil collapse and collection above the shoring     30meter pipe spools a 25 mm pp rope was used to pull
box additionally the use of ms shoring plates requires     one end of the belt from the ground level to remove the
an 18mt crawler crane due to its high operating              cotton belts from the lowered pipeline
radius resulting in additional execution costs moreover
executing pipe jointing at a ninemeter depth can also       result
lead to life threatening situations
