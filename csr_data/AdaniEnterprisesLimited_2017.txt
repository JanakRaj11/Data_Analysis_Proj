     which delegalized almost
     85 of the currency in the
     system in november 2016
     and the implementation
     of the goods and services
     act gst that will have
     a farreaching impact on
     the economy through a
     unified tax regime these
     structural resets are
     expected to strengthen
     indias economic growth by
     at least 100150 bps over

		          the cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined

            developments in the future these include the determination of the discount rate future salary increases and mortality

			             a the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash
                    flows and
			             b contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                    and interest sppi on the principal amount outstanding
			             this category is the most relevant to the company after initial measurement such financial assets are subsequently
                measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate eir method amortised cost is calculated by taking
                into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir the eir
                amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss the losses arising from impairment

             cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in oci is reclassified to statement of profit and loss for equity
             instruments the company may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value
             in oci if the company decides to classify an equity instrument as at fvtoci then all fair value changes on the
             instrument excluding dividends are recognised in the oci there is no recycling of the amounts from oci to
             statement of profit and loss even on sale of investment

		 3        at fair value through profit  loss fvtpl
			          fvtpl is a residual category for debt instruments and default category for equity instruments financial assets
             included within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of
             profit and loss
			          in addition the company may elect to designate a debt instrument which otherwise meets amortised cost
             or fvtoci criteria as at fvtpl however such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a
             measurement or recognition inconsistency referred to as accounting mismatch

         derecognition
		       on derecognition of a financial asset the difference between the assets carrying amount and the sum of the
         consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive
         income and accumulated in equity is recognised in statement of profit and loss if such gain or loss would have
         otherwise been recognised in statement of profit and loss on disposal of that financial asset

		       impairment of financial assets
		       the company applies expected credit loss ecl model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the
         financial assets and credit risk exposure the company assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses
         associated with its receivables based on historical trends and past experience
		       the company follows simplified approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade receivables or
         contractual receivables under the simplified approach the company does not track changes in credit risk but it
         recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date right from its initial recognition
         if credit risk has not increased significantly 12 month ecl is used to provide for impairment loss however if credit risk
         has increased significantly lifetime ecl is used
		       ecl is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the company in accordance with the contract
         and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive discounted at the original eir ecl impairment loss
         allowance or reversal recognised during the period is recognised as income  expense in the statement of profit
         and loss

  b financial liabilities
		   financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss the
     measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described below

		       at amortised cost
		       this is the category most relevant to the company after initial recognition financial liabilities are subsequently
         measured at amortised cost using the eir method gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss
         when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eir amortisation process amortised cost is calculated by
         taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir the
         eir amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss

		at fair value through profit  loss fvtpl
		 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
   designated upon initial recognition as such subsequently any changes in fair value are recognised in the statement
   of profit and loss

		       derecognition of financial liability
		       a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires the
         difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss




                                                                                                                                  115

            foreign currency risks such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently measured at
            fair value through profit or loss fvtpl derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and
            as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative
		          any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised in the
            statement of profit and loss and reported with foreign exchange gainsloss not within results from operating

            a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time
            of the transaction
		          deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
            the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
            utilised the carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to assess
            their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying values of deferred tax assets in the financial
            statements
		          deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
            is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
            at the reporting date
		          deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets and
            liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority
		          deferred tax includes mat tax credit the company recognises tax credits in the nature of mat credit as an asset only
            to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the company will pay normal income tax during the specified
            period ie the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward the company reviews the such tax credit
            asset at each reporting date to assess its recoverability

notes to above reconciliations 
a   mtm on derivative financial instruments 
     derivative financial instruments have been fair valued through profit and loss under ind as under previous gaap the
     net mark to market losses on derivative financial instruments other than those designated as cash flow hedges were
     recognised in statement of profit and loss and the net gains if any were ignored

b   impact on accounting of financial instruments at amortised cost 
     the company has valued financial assets other than investment in joint ventures subsidiaries and associates which are
     accounted at cost and financial liabilities at fair value at the inception of the contract impact of fair value changes as
     on date of transition is recognised in opening reserves these financial instruments have been subsequently accounted
     under the amortised cost model with resultant changes thereafter being recognised in statement of profit and loss

c   actuarial valuation 
     actuarial gains  losses on account of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income

d   accounting for asset retirement obligations 
     cost of decommissioning any item of property plant and equipment is included in the initial cost thereof and a liability
     equivalent to present value of such costs is recognised depreciation on asset and imputed interest on the provision is
     subsequently recognised in the statement of profit and loss

e   deferred tax 
     the impact of transition adjustments together with ind as mandate of using balance sheet approach against profit and
     loss approach in the previous gaap for computation of deferred taxes has resulted in charge to reserves on the date of
     transition with consequential impact in the statement of profit and loss for the subsequent periods

f   reversal of proposed dividend including tax 
     under previous gaap dividends proposed by the board of directors after the reporting date but before the approval
     of financial statements were considered to be adjusting event and accordingly recognised along with related dividend
     distribution tax as liability at the reporting date under ind as dividends are recognised when the same is approved by
     the shareholders in the general meeting accordingly provision for so proposed dividend and dividend distribution tax
     recognised under previous gaap has been reversed




                                                                                                                              121

		        reporting date is 31st december 2016

b   use of estimates and judgements
     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with ind as requires management to make certain judgements
     estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities including
     contingent liabilities and the accompanying disclosures future results could differ due to these estimates and differences
     between the actual results and the estimates are recognised in the periods in which the results are known  materialised

     estimates and assumptions are required in particular for
  i     useful life of property plant and equipment and intangible assets
		       determination of the estimated useful life of property plant and equipment and intangible assets and the assessment
         as to which components of the cost may be capitalised useful life of these assets is based on the life prescribed in
         schedule ii to the companies act 2013 or based on technical estimate taking into account the nature of the asset
         estimated usage expected residual values and operating conditions of the asset

  ii    impairment
		       determining whether property plant and equipment and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of
         the value in use of the relevant cash generating units the value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash
         flow model over the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or cash generating units further the cash flow
         projections are based on estimates and assumptions relating to expected revenues operational performance of the
         assets market prices of related products or services inflation terminal value etc which are considered reasonable by
         the management

  iii taxes
		     significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of paying advance tax determining
       the provision for income taxes including amount expected to be paidrecovered for uncertain tax positions significant
       management judgement is also required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised
       based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies
       including estimates of temporary differences reversing on account of available benefits from the tax laws applicable
       to respective entities

  iv fair value measurement of financial instruments
		    when the fair values of financials assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured
      based on quoted prices in active markets their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the
      discounted cash flow model which involve various judgements and assumptions

  v     defined benefit plans
		       the cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined
         using actuarial valuations an actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual
         developments in the future these include the determination of the discount rate future salary increases and mortality
         rates due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its longterm nature a defined benefit obligation is highly
         sensitive to changes in these assumptions all assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date




                                                                                                                             189

    ii   subsequent expenditure related to an item of property plant and equipment are included in its carrying amount or
          recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that the future economic benefits associated
          with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably all other expenses on existing
          property plant and equipment including daytoday repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of replacing parts
          are charged to the statement of profit and loss for the period during which such expenses are incurred
    iii the group adjusts exchange differences arising on translationsettlement of longterm foreign currency monetary

      license are initially capitalised on a license by license basis costs including indirect cost incurred for the block are
      held undepleted within capital work in progress until the exploration phase relating to the license area is complete
      or commercial oil  gas reserves have been discovered indirect costs are expensed off in the year of incurrence
		        exploratoryappraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised within capital work in progress on a block by block basis
          until the success or otherwise of the block is established the success or failure of each explorationappraisal effort
          is judged on a block basis
		        where results of seismic studies or exploration drilling indicate the presence of oil  gas reserves which are ultimately
          not considered commercially recoverable and no additional exploratory activity is firmly planned all related costs are
          written off to the statement of profit and loss in the year of cessation of the exploration activity
  vii exploration and evaluation assets
		     exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises cost that are directly attributable to 
		           cost of acquiring mining and exploration tenements

            accumulated impairment charges no amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase as the
            assets is not available for use

g    investment property
      i property which is held for longterm rental yields or for capital appreciation or both is classified as investment property
          investment properties are measured initially at cost including transaction costs subsequent to initial recognition
          investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss if any
      ii   the group depreciates investment properties over their estimated useful lives which are determined based on
            technical evaluation and management estimates
      iii investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed of or when they are permanently
           withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal the difference between the net
           disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in statement of profit and loss in the period in
           which the property is derecognised

h    intangible assets
      i intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less any accumulated
          amortisation and accumulated impairment losses if any internally generated intangibles are not capitalised
      ii   the intangible assets of the group are assessed to be of finite lives and are amortised over the useful economic life
            and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired the group
            reviews amortisation period on an annual basis
		          intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows
             intangible assets                                            estimated useful life years
             software applications                                        35 years based on management estimate
             mine development assets                                      over a period of underlying contract
      iii gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
           disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when
           the asset is derecognised

i    impairment of nonfinancial assets
      i the carrying amount of the nonfinancial assets of the group is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
         whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the assets is
         estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment
      ii   the impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generation unit exceeds its
            recoverable amount the recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less cost of disposal and value in
            use which is determined based on the estimated future cash flow discounted to their present value all impairment
            losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss
      iii an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount
           and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss the reversal is limited so that the increased carrying amount
           does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in
           prior years
      iv goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually as at year end or when
          circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired impairment for these assets is determined by
          assessing the recoverable amount of each cgu to which they relate when the recoverable amount of the cgu is less
          than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognised impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed in

     with respect to sca revenue and costs are allocated between those relating to construction services and those relating to
     operation and maintenance services and accounted for separately the infrastructure used in a concession are classified
     as an intangible asset or a financial asset depending on the nature of the payment entitlements under the sca when
     the company has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor
     such right is recognised as a financial asset and is subsequently measured at amortised cost when the demand risk is
     with the group and it has right to charge the user for use of facility the right is recognised as an intangible asset and is
     subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses the intangible assets are amortised
     over a period of service concession arrangements

k   government grants  subsidies
     government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received
     and all attached conditions will be complied with
     when the grant relates to an expense item it is deferred and recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss on
     a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match the related costs which they are intended to compensate
     when the grant relates to an asset or a nonmonetary item it is recognised as deferred income under liabilities and is
     recognised as income in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the
     related asset or a nonmonetary item

l   financial instruments
     a financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
     instrument of another entity
     financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value transaction costs that are directly attributable
     to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities other than financial assets and financial liabilities at
     fair value through profit or loss are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities as
     appropriate on initial recognition transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial
     liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss
     an equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its
     liabilities equity instruments issued by a group entity are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs

  a financial assets
		   all financial assets except investment in subsidiaries associates and joint ventures are recognised initially at fair
     value
		       the measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as described below

		 1         at amortised cost
			           a financial asset is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met 
			           a the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash
                  flows and
			           b contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                  and interest sppi on the principal amount outstanding
			           this category is the most relevant to the group after initial measurement such financial assets are subsequently
              measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate eir method amortised cost is calculated by taking
              into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir the eir
              amortisation is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss the losses arising from impairment
              are recognised in the statement of profit and loss this category generally applies to trade and other receivables

		 2         at fair value through other comprehensive income fvtoci
			           a financial asset is classified as at the fvtoci if both of the following criteria are met
			           a   the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the
                   financial assets and




                                                                                                                                    193

			          b contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
                 and interest sppi on the principal amount outstanding
			          debt instruments included within the fvtoci category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at
             fair value fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income oci and on derecognition
             cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in oci is reclassified to statement of profit and loss for equity
             instruments the group may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value in oci
             if the group decides to classify an equity instrument as at fvtoci then all fair value changes on the instrument
             excluding dividends are recognised in the oci there is no recycling of the amounts from oci to the statement of
             profit and loss even on sale of investment

   3        at fair value through profit or loss fvtpl
			          fvtpl is a residual category for debt instruments and default category for equity instruments financial assets
             included within the fvtpl category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of
             profit and loss
			          in addition the group may elect to designate a debt instrument which otherwise meets amortised cost or fvtoci
             criteria as at fvtpl however such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or
             recognition inconsistency referred to as accounting mismatch

		derecognition
		 on derecognition of a financial asset the difference between the assets carrying amount and the sum of the
   consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive
   income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been
   recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that financial asset

		      impairment of financial assets
		      the group applies expected credit loss ecl model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the
        financial assets and credit risk exposure the group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses
        associated with its receivables based on historical trends and past experience
		      the group follows simplified approach for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade receivables
        or contractual receivables under the simplified approach the group does not track changes in credit risk but it
        recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ecls at each reporting date right from its initial recognition
        if credit risk has not increased significantly 12 month ecl is used to provide for impairment loss however if credit risk
        has increased significantly lifetime ecl is used
		      ecl is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the group in accordance with the contract
        and all the cash flows that the group expects to receive discounted at the original eir ecl impairment loss allowance
        or reversal recognised during the period is recognised as expense  income in the statement of profit and loss

  b financial liabilities
		   financial liabilities are classified at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss the
     measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as described below

		      at amortised cost
		      this is the category most relevant to the group after initial recognition financial liabilities are subsequently measured
        at amortised cost using the eir method gains and losses are recognised in statement of profit and loss when the
        liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eir amortisation process amortised cost is calculated by taking
        into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eir the eir
        amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss

        at fair value through profit or loss fvtpl
		      financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities
        designated upon initial recognition as such subsequently any changes in fair value are recognised in the statement
        of profit and loss

        derecognition of financial liability
		      a financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires the
        difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss

    c derivative financial instruments
		      initial recognition and subsequent measurement
		      the group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward and options currency contracts to hedge its foreign
        currency risks such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value
        through profit or loss fvtpl derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial
        liabilities when the fair value is negative
		      any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised in the
        statement of profit and loss and reported with foreign exchange gainsloss not within results from operating
        activities changes in fair value and gainslosses on settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments
        relating to borrowings which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance expense

m income taxes
   income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability during the
   year current and deferred taxes are recognised in statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that
   are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity in which case the current and deferred tax are also
   recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively

  i    current income tax
		      provision for current tax is measured at the amount of tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year
        as determined in accordance with the provisions of the tax laws of the concerned jurisdictions current income tax
        assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities
		      current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the group has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either
        to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

  ii   deferred tax
		      deferred income tax is recognised using the balance sheet approach deferred income tax assets and liabilities are
        recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and
        their carrying amount except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in
        a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time
        of the transaction
		      deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which
        the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be
        utilised the carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to assess
        their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying values of deferred tax assets in the financial
        statements
		      deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset
        is realised or the liability is settled based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted
        at the reporting date
		      deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets and
        liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority
		      deferred tax includes mat tax credit the group recognises tax credits in the nature of mat credit as an asset only to
        the extent that there is convincing evidence that the group will pay normal income tax during the specified period
        ie the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward the group reviews the such tax credit asset at
        each reporting date to assess its recoverability




                                                                                                                               195

		          stores and spares		         weighted average cost
      iv net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost of completion

      pretax rate that reflects when appropriate the risks specific to the liability when discounting is used the increase in the
      provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost
      contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a result of past events the existence of which will be confirmed only
      by the occurrence or non occurrence of one or more future events not wholly in control of the group are not recognised
      in the accounts the nature of such liabilities and an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial
      statements
