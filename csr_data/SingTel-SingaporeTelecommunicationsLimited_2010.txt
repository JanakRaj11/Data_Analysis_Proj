                        the kim chuan telecommunications centre 2 was officially commissioned in january 2010
                        the new data centre was awarded the green mark gold by the building and construction

                    in 2009 195 photovoltaic panels have been installed on
                    the roof which allow the system to collect energy to
                    power up 182 personal computers for ten hours or half
                    the lighting system per day at this exchange in total
                    we harnessed 49750 kwh with this system last year
