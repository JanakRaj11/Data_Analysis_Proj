                                  president




iwatani will contribute to a new era of clean energy
with its combined strength as a leading energy supplier

iwatani s history is the one of clean energy
energy supply is iwatani s core business we have always selected the best forms of energy
in line with our corporate philosophy those needed by society can prosper  we were
among the ﬁrst to focus our attention on clean energy our combined strength comes from
covering the full range of processes including manufacture storage distribution and safety
measure of lpg liqueﬁed petroleum gas natural gas and hydrogen  the nextgeneration
energy  for safe and secure delivery to our customers
we deliver familiar clean lpg to nearly 31 million households through our sales networks
across the country in a comprehensive system from import to delivery we are also extending
our supply bases and areas for natural gas as industrial demand for this energy increases we
began our hydrogen business more than half a century ago and as a pioneer have played an
important role in numerous projects which have integrated the separate players in industry



                                                                                                    message from the president
government and academia we have also actively promoted a hydrogenbased society
through sponsoring hydrogen energy forums around the country



better society with clean energy
people s concerns about the environment are constantly growing with particular attention being
paid to the importance of resources and energy society is on the threshold of a major change to
a lowcarbon society there are now moves to disseminate householduse fuel cell cogeneration
systems with new applications and the development of hydrogen energy progressing steadily
clean energy is literally a driving force supporting our daily lives and society in the future a
cornerstone upon which a sustainable society will be constructed pursuing an ideal and promot
ing clean energy applications are our themes and our mission iwatani has developed a combined
strength over the years as a leading supplier of clean energy and using this strength will
continue to tackle environmental issues and ﬁnding solutions we sincerely ask your continuing
