     earnings risks
     underwriting risk can be defined in general as a change in value caused by ultimate costs for full
     contractual obligations varying from those assumed when these obligations were estimated hence
     underwriting risk realizes as a loss or adverse change in the value of insurance liabilities due to pricing
     and provisioning assumptions on claims payments being different than the actual ones

                        e underwriting risk s

     in nonlife insurance underwriting risk is often divided in premium and reserve risk in order to
     distinguish between the risks related to unexpired and expired contracts

     premium risk relates to future claims and originates from claim sizes being greater than expected
     differences in timing of claims payments from expected and differences in claims frequency from those
     expected as a result the claims cost for future claims exceeds the expected level and there is a loss or
     adverse changes in the value of insurance liabilities

     catastrophe risk can be seen as an extreme case of premium risk it is the risk of low frequency high
     severity events such as natural catastrophes these events lead to significant deviations in actual claims
     from the total expected claims

     reserve risk only relates to incurred claims ie existing claims and originates from claim sizes being
     greater than expected differences in timing of claims payments from expected and differences in
     claims frequency from those expected as a result technical provisions are not sufficient to cover the
     cost for already incurred claims and there is a loss or adverse changes in the value of insurance
     liabilities

     biometric risks refer to the risk that the company has to pay more mortality disability or morbidity
     benefits than expected or the company has to keep paying pension payments to the pension policy
     holders for a longer time longevity risk than expected when pricing the policies when a low
     frequency high severity event leads to a significant deviation in actual benefits and payments from the
     total expected payments catastrophe risk has realized

     policyholder behaviour risks arise from the uncertainty related to behaviour of the policyholders the
     policyholders have the right to cease paying premiums lapse risk and may have a possibility to
     interrupt their policies surrender risk

    expense risk arises from the fact that the timing andor the amount of expenses incurred differs from
    those expected at the timing of pricing as a result expense charges originally assumed may not be
    enough to cover the realized expenses

    values of financial assets and liabilities as well as by changes in the economic value of insurance

    spreads and the risk of unexpected changes in repayment schedules of assets in both cases the market
    values of financial instruments in investment portfolios may change

    risks and returns in different markets are considered when sampo group companies enter into
    investments or sell investments from investment portfolios the fundamental distinction between market
    risks and underwriting risks is that relating to market risks sampo group is in most cases a price taker
    and not a price giver

     counterparty risk is part of credit risk in general credit risk refers to losses arising from occurred
     defaults of debtors issuer risk or other counterparties counterparty risk or from increases in assumed
     probability of defaults

     in the case of issuer risk the final loss depends on the investors holding of the security at the time of
     default mitigated by the recovery rate in most cases issuer risk has already been fully priced as a lower
     market value before the event of default has occurred in essence credit spread is the market price of
     credit risk similarly as other earnings risks spread risk can be actively managed therefore it is
     categorized in sampo group under investment portfolio market risks

     in the case of counterparty risk the final loss depends on the positive marktomarket value of
     derivatives or reinsurance recoverables at the time of default and on the recovery rate counterparty
     credit risk is mitigated by careful selection of counterparties by diversification of counterparties to
     prevent risk concentrations and by using collateral techniques eg isda master agreements backed by
     credit support annexes

     operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems from
     personnel or from external events this definition includes legal risk but excludes risks resulting from
     strategic decisions the risks may realize for instance as a consequence of

       internal misconduct
       external misconduct
       insufficient human resources management
       insufficiencies in operating policies as far as customers products or business activities are concerned
       damage to physical property
       interruption of activities and system failures and
       defects in the operating process

     materialized operational risks can cause immediate negative impact on financial results due to additional
     costs or loss of earnings in longer term materialized operational risks can lead to loss of reputation and
     eventually loss of customers which endangers the companys ability to conduct business activities in
     accordance with the strategy

some risks such as interest rate currency and liquidity        and liabilities may fluctuate at the total balance sheet
risks are by their nature linked to various activities          level under different scenarios is needed these
simultaneously in order to manage these risks                  balance sheet level risks are commonly defined as

addition a thorough understanding of how expected              relevance to risks and earnings in the long run
cash flows and the market consistent values of assets




     alm risks
     when changes in different market risk variables interest rates inflation foreign exchange rates cause a
     change in the fair values of investment assets and derivatives that is of different size than the respective
     change in the economic value of insurance liabilities the company is exposed to alm risk it is crucial to
     remember that the cash flows of insurance liabilities are modelled estimates and therefore uncertain in
     relation to both their timing and amount this uncertainty is a central component of alm risk as well

     on balance sheet level alm risks contribute considerably to economic values risks and capital need
     sampo group companies analyse alm risks and monitor alm exposures actively and the risks are taken
     into account when managing investments and developing insurance products

     in addition to the risks relating to fluctuations in market values and economic values alm risks include
     liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that group companies are due to lack of available liquid funds
     andor access to relevant markets unable to conduct their regular business activities in accordance
     with the strategy or in extreme cases are unable to settle their financial obligations when they fall due
     liquidity risk includes potential illiquidity of investments and unexpected nonrenewal of insurance
     policies moreover the availability and cost of refinancing and prices of financial derivatives affect the
     group companies ability to carry out normal business activities

     the sources of liquidity risk are either internal or external if the companys rating declines or if the
     companys solvency otherwise appears jeopardised its ability to raise funding sign reinsurance
     contracts or enter into financial derivatives at a reasonable price is endangered moreover policyholders
     may also not be willing to renew their policies these effects may realize in a general market turmoil
     situation simultaneously with difficulties to sell investment assets

     sampo group manages the liquidity risk by maintaining both parent companys and the subsidiaries
     creditworthiness and reputation on appropriate level also diversification within business operations
     exposed to liquidity risks is sought in particular the maturity diversification of expected cash flows
     generated from different business activities is under constant scrutiny since there is no unambiguous
     technique to quantify the capital need for liquidity risk it is not directly taken into account in capital
     need estimates thus only the interest rate risk part of alm risks is accounted for in the economic
     capital framework

defined above with the exception of operational risks          any activity is the reputational risk




     concentration risks at different levels
     direct concentrations can evolve within separate activities  large single name or industry specific
     insurance or investment exposures  or across the activities when a single name or an industry is
     contributing widely on profitability and risks of the company through both insurance and investment
     activities

     concentration risk may materialize also when profitability and capital position react similarly to general
     economic development or to structural changes in institutional environment in different areas of
     business in that case concentration risk can be seen as part of strategic risk




     reputational risk
     reputational risk refers to the risk that adverse publicity regarding the companys business practices or
     associations whether accurate or not causes a loss of confidence in the integrity of the institution
     reputational risk is often a consequence of a materialized operational or compliance risk and realizes
     often as a deterioration of reputation amongst customers and other stakeholders

     principles of investment portfolio management
     investments excluding mandatum lifes investments covering unitlinked policies are managed
     according to the subsidiaries investment policies that are based on the features of insurance liabilities
     and solvency

     the investment portfolios are reported on fair value basis these fair values are determined either on the
     basis of direct market quotes or by using various valuation models more information on the valuation
     methods of the investment assets is presented in note 17 in the sampo group financial statements

     sampo groups chief investment officer is responsible for managing investments within the limitations
     of the investment policies prepared by the group companies and approved by the group companies
     boards of directors the insurance subsidiaries and the parent company have a common group wide
     infrastructure for investment management as well as for performance and risk reporting which facilitates
     simultaneous company level and group level reporting

     sampo group considers that it has a thorough understanding of the nordic markets and issuers and
     consequently sampo groups direct investments are mainly made in nordic securities when investing in
     nonnordic securities funds or other assets third party managed investments are mainly used these
     investments are primarily used as a tool in tactical asset allocation when seeking return and secondarily
     in order to increase diversification

     market risk control is separated from portfolio management activities in two ways firstly the persons
     independent from investment unit prepare investment policies for the board approval secondly middle
     office units that are independent from investment unit as well measure risks and performance and
     control limits set in investment policies on a daily basis market risks and limits are also controlled by the
     icc in if pc and alco in mandatum life on a monthly basis at a minimum these committees are
     responsible for the control of investment activities within the respective legal entity

     the aggregated market risks and concentrations at sampo group level are controlled by the groups
     audit committee quarterly at a minimum

         investments denominated in the scandinavian currencies and in the respective countries
        the external asset managers and funds managed by them are selected for both companies by the
         same members of sampo groups investment unit the funds are mostly allocated to areas outside
         the nordic countries consequently the risk of unidentified or unwanted concentrations is relatively
         low
        furthermore concentrations at group level are actively monitored and if deemed necessary further
         managed by deploying group level exposure restrictions for instance by industries or by individual
         issuers

     economic capital and adjusted solvency capital in sampo group
       ec is used as an internal measure of capital required for measurable risks the group is exposed to ec
        is defined as the amount of capital required to protect the solvency over a one year time horizon with
        a probability of 995 per cent that is the calculation basis in solvency ii as well
       ec accounts for market credit insurance and operational risks as well as the diversification effect
        between them ec is calculated using a set of calculation methods seen suitable for the specific
        needs of each business area
       when assessing the ec need arising from nordea sampo plc uses the ec calculated and publicly
        reported by nordea multiplied by the proportion of sampo plcs share in nordea 2125 per cent at
        the end of 2013 this figure is converted from confidence level 9997 per cent used by nordea to 995
        per cent
       ec is considered to be a good estimate of the capital required to cover risks that can be measured in

testing goodwill for impairment

goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with ias 36 impairment of assets no impairment losses have been recognised
based on these tests

for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment sampo determines the recoverable amount of its cashgenerating units to
which goodwill has been allocated on the basis of value in use sampo has defined these cashgenerating units as if group and
mandatum life

the recoverable amounts for if have been determined by using a discounted cash flow model the model is based on sampos
managements best estimates of both historical evidence and economic conditions such as volumesinterest rates margins
capital structure and income and cost development the value in use model for mandatum life is greatly influenced by the long
term development of insurance liabilities affecting eg the required solvency capital and thus the recoverable amount that is
why the forecast period is longer for mandatum life 10 years the derived cash flows were discounted at the pretax rates of the
weighted average cost of capital which for if was 94 per cent and for mandatum life 97 per cent these are somewhat higher
than last year due to the increase in nordic government bonds

forecasts for if approved by the management cover years 2014  2016 the cash flows beyond that have been extrapolated
using a 2 per cent growth rate a 2 per cent growth rate for years beyond 2023 has been used for the for mandatum life as well
as it is believed to be close to the anticipated inflation

in mandatum life the recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount by some eurm 180 with the calculation method used
eg an increase of about 14 per cent in the weighted average cost of capital could lead to a situation where the recoverable
amount of the entity would equal its carrying amount

as for the if group the management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would not
cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount

in the table above are presented fair values and carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities the detailed measurement
bases of financial assets and liabilities are disclosed in group accounting policies


the fair value of investment securities is assessed using quoted prices in active markets if published price quotations are not
available the fair value is assessed using discounting method values for the discount rates are taken from the markets yield
curve


the fair value of the derivative instruments is assessed using quoted market prices in active markets discounting method or
option pricing models


the fair value of loans and other financial instruments which have no quoted price in active markets is based on discounted cash
flows using quoted market rates the markets yield curve is adjusted by other components of the instrument eg by credit risk


the fair value for shortterm noninterestbearing receivables and payables is their carrying amount


disclosed fair values are clean fair values ie less interest accruals




                                                                   214

17 determination and hierarchy of fair values

a large majority of sampo groups financial assets are valued at fair value the valuation is based on either published price
quatations or valuation techniques based on market observable inputs where available for a limited amount of assets the value
needs to be determined using other techniques


the financial instruments measured at fair value have been classified into three hierarchy levels in the notes depending on eg if
the market for the instrument is active or if the inputs used in the valuation technique are observable


on level 1 the measurement of the instrument is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities


on level 2 inputs for the measurement of the instrument include also other than quoted prices observable for the asset or
liability either directly or indirectly by using valuation techniques


in level 3 the measurement is based on other inputs rather than observable market data

increase recognised in profitloss of eurm 12 15 and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 11 11 in life
insurance 10 percentage point depreciation of all other currencies against eur would result in an increase recognised in profit
loss of eurm 14 52 and in a decrease recognised directly in equity of eurm 68 64 in holding 10 percentage point

since january 1 2008 the main swedish pension plan has been closed to new employees born in 1972 or later and the
corresponding norwegian pension plan has been closed to new employees since january 1 2007 regardless of age the pension
benefits referred to are oldage pension and survivors pension in sweden and oldage pension survivors pension and disability
pension in norway a common feature of all of the pension plans is that the employees and survivors encompassed by the plans
are entitled to a guaranteed pension that depends on the employees service period and pensionable salary at the time of
retirement the dominating benefit is the oldage pension which refers in part to temporary pension before the anticipated
retirement age and in part to a lifelong pension after the anticipated retirement age


the retirement age for receiving premature pension is normally 62 years in sweden and normally 65 years in norway in sweden
premature oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 65 per cent of the
pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1955 or earlier and who were covered by the insurance sectors collective
bargaining agreement of 2006 in norway premature oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of
approximately 70 per cent of the pensionable salary and applies to all employees born in 1957 or earlier and who were employed
by if in 2013


the anticipated retirement age in connection with lifelong pension is 65 years for sweden and 67 years for norway in sweden
lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at a rate of approximately 10 per cent of the pensionable
salary between 0 and 75 income base amounts 65 per cent of salary between 75 and 20 income base amounts and 325 per cent
between 20 and 30 income base amounts in norway lifelong oldage pension following a complete service period is payable at
a rate of approximately 70 per cent of the pensionable salary up to 12 norwegian base amounts together with the estimated
statutory oldage pension paidup policies and pension payments from the swedish plans are normally indexed upwards in an
amount corresponding to the change in the consumer price index however there is no agreement guaranteeing the value and
future supplements in addition to the contractual pension benefit could either rise of fall pension payments from the norwegian
plans are indexed upwards in an amount corresponding to the change in the consumer price index


the pensions are primarily funded through insurance whereby the insurers establish the premiums and disburse the benefits ifs
obligation is primarily fulfilled through payment of the premiums should the assets that are attributable to the pension benefits
not be sufficient to enable the insurers to cover the guaranteed pension benefits if could be forced to pay supplementary
insurance premiums or secure the pension obligations in some other way in addition to insured pension plans there are also
unfunded pension benefits in norway for which if is responsible for ongoing payment


to cover the insured pension benefits the related capital is managed as part of the insurers management portfolios in such
management the characteristics of the investment assets are analysed in relation to the characteristics of the obligations in a
process known as asset liability management new and existing asset categories are evaluated continuously in order to diversify
the asset portfolios with a view to optimising the anticipated riskadjusted return any surplus that arises from management of
the assets normally accrues to if andor the insured and there is no form of transfer of the asset value to other members of the
insurance collective


the insurers and if are jointly responsible for monitoring the pension plans including investment decisions and contributions the
pension plans are essentially exposed to similar material risks regarding the final amount of the benefits the investment risk
associated with the plan assets and the fact that the choice of discount interest rate affects their valuation in the financial
statements


when applying ias 19 the pension obligations are calculated as is the pension cost attributable to the fiscal period using
actuarial methods pension rights are considered to have been vested straight line during the service period the calculation of
pension obligations is based on future anticipated pension payments and includes assumptions regarding mortality employee
turnover and salary growth the nominally calculated debt is discounted to the present value using an interest rate based on
current market interest rates adjusted to take into account the duration of the companys pension obligations as a basis for
determining the discount interest rate for the swedish obligation if uses liquid covered mortgage bonds issued by a mortgage
institution covered mortgage bonds are also used for the norwegian obligation after a deduction for the plan assets a net asset
or net liability is recognised in the balance sheet


the following tables contain a number of material assumptions specifications of pension costs assets and liabilities and a
sensitivity analysis showing the potential effect on the obligations of reasonable changes in those assumptions as at the end of
the fiscal year the carrying amounts have been stated including special payroll tax in sweden 2426 per cent and a
corresponding fee in norway 141 per cent

the board of directors of sampo plc has decided on the longterm incentive schemes 2009 i  2011 i for the management and key
employees of sampo group the board has authorised the ceo to decide who will be included in the scheme as well as the
number of calculated incentive units granted for each individual used in determining the amount of the incentive reward in the
schemes the number of calculated incentive units granted for the members of the group executive committee is decided by the
board of directors over 110 persons were included in the schemes at the end of year 2013


the amount of the performancerelated bonus is based on the value performance of sampos a share and on the insurance
margin im and regarding the 2011 i scheme also on sampos return on the risk adjusted capital rorac the value of one
calculated incentive unit is the tradeweighted average price of sampos ashare at the time period specified in the terms of the
scheme and reduced by the starting price adjusted with the dividends per share distributed up to the payment date the pre
dividend starting prices vary between eur 1649  2407 the maximum value of one incentive unit varies between eur 2849 
3907 reduced by the dividendadjusted starting price in the 2011 i scheme the incentive reward depends on two benchmarks
the payout is 70 per cent if the im is 6 per cent or more and 35 per cent if the im is between 4  599 per cent no imrelated
reward will be paid out if the im stays below these in addition the return on the risk adjusted capital is taken into account so
that an incentive reward of 30 per cent is paid out if the return is at least risk free return  4 per cent if the return is risk free
return  2 per cent but less than risk free return  4 per cent the payout is 15 per cent if the return stays below these
benchmarks no roracbased reward will be paid out


each plan has three performance periods and incentive rewards are settled in cash in three installments in the scheme 2009 i
when the reward is paid the employee shall buy sampos ashares at the first possible opportunity taking into account the
provisions on insiders with 30 per cent of the amount of the reward after taxes and other comparable charges and to keep the
shares in hisher possession for 2 years in the 2011 i scheme the employee shall buy sampo a shares with 60 per cent of the net
amount of reward received the shares are subject to transfer restrictions for three years from the day of payout a premature
payment of the reward may occur in the event of changes in the group structure or in the case of employment termination on
specifically determined bases the fair value of the incentive schemes is estimated by using the blackscholes princing model


the longeterm incentive scheme 2009 i ended in september 2013 when the last reward was paid out
