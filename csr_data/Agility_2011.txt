offering more efficient logistics solutions

agility strives to create efficient supply chains and the process of optimizing supply chains for customers often creates reduced environmental impact this is best illustrated by example

case study dubai container freight station

over a period of two years agilitys dubai operation noticed that there was increase in the number of lessthanfullcontainer loads being shipped from dubai in response agility developed a container freight
station cfs at the jebel ali free zone the countrys largest manmade terminal and a major hub for freight movements throughout the middle east the 1000 square meters station is a major consolidation and
redistribution service center that enables agility to consolidate cargoes originating from ports worldwide and redistribute them throughout the arabian gulf region and africa by using a centralized distribution
center agility is able to reduce costs and improve environmental performance because shipments from multiple customers can be consolidated into a single container moving to a single destination where cargo
was once being moved on four or ﬁve different containers today they can be consolidated into only one freight move the container freight station also eliminates the need for a third party consolidators and
eliminates the trucks and trips required to transport containers to and from the thirdparty consolidators
