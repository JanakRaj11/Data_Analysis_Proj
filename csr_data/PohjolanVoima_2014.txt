joining resources is the path to the future
pohjolan voimas joint resources increase our customers competitive advantage through producing efficient and innovative energy services the year 2013
was pohjolan voimas 70th year of operations according to our strategy we continued the development of the corporate structure production plant
improvement and our investments in carbonneutral production in this way we can better tackle the challenges brought about by the continuing uncertain
financial situation and changes in the operating environment


more efficiency through iijoki hydropower plant renovation
pohjolan voima focuses on the production of hydropower thermal power and nuclear power the hydropower renovation programme continued in iijoki
over eight years we have renewed the machinery of eight power plants which improves their efficiency ratio and increases the production of renewable
energy our renovation programme in iijoki is ready for now the challenge for hydropower continues to be that the large volume of water during the flood
season has to be routed past the units because there are no reserve basins in iijoki about 20 of the water was routed past the power plants in 2013

in hydropower we adopted an operating model where plant operation and maintenance was assigned to an external partner through the partnership
operating model we make our operations more costeffective and develop them at the same time we ensure the longterm competence that we need


the worlds largest biogasifier introduced
the thermal powerrelated bioenergy programme continued in 2013 the worlds first power plantclass biogasifier built by our associated company
vaskiluodon voima in vaasa is the 16th power plant in our bioenergy programme in the gasifier a substantial part of the coal used as the fuel is replaced
with wood chips in thermal power preparations for the new requirements specified in the eu industrial emissions regulation continued the profitability of
thermal power plants was improved by renewing organisation structures


recordhigh volume of nuclear power production
the production of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant reached the best result in its history the construction of the third reactor progressed and the design
and tendering phase of the fourth reactor continued posivas construction permit application for the final disposal of nuclear fuel is being processed


stakeholder day on the future of energy and climate
the goals for 2030 were highlighted in the energy and climate policy in 2013 the stakeholder day spent in celebration of pohjolan voimas 70th year of
operations focused on the future of energy and climate the basic goal of the energy and climate policy should continue to be to secure energy supply at a
competitive price while keeping the impact on the environment minimal the goals for 2030 should focus on reducing emissions and to give up binding
goals for renewable energy steering should trust emissions trade and there should not be steering methods that overlap or cross it


market functionality jeopardised
extensive support to the production of wind and solar power which vary according to weather conditions in europe has caused a situation where the
profitability of basic power capacity is jeopardised in many countries many eu states are planning the introduction of capacity mechanisms to support the
use of basic power this is causing a situation where the electricity market is crumbling and no form of electricity production is profitable anymore without
societys support support systems should be abolished and faith in marketbased investments should be restored




 1                                                                                                            pohjolan voima  annual report 2013

loadfollowing capacity should also be selfsufficient
finnish energy production should be enough to cover the needs during peak consumption and disruptions relying on imports is a major price and
competitiveness risk finland needs more production capacity just to replace the plants which will be shut down in the next few years

the increase in wind power production increases the need for loadfollowing capacity hydropower is the best and most costeffective production form of
balancing power in addition it is the only renewable form of electricity generation that can be increased without financial support the government should
have the courage to discuss hydropower in the energy and climate strategy work spanning to 2050 the coalfired plants in use are a vital part of load
following capacity in finland and they should not be given up before the expiry of their technical life


power plant tax causes investment risks
in late 2013 the finnish parliament decided on the power plant tax on existing hydropower and nuclear power the taxation of carbonneutral production
does not comply with the climate policy and this increases the political risks on energy investments and causes higher financing costs to companies the
power plant tax is still being processed by the european commission


longterm policies appreciated
since the turn of the millennium pohjolan voima has invested a total of 4 billion euros in carbonneutral production capacity about 15 billion euros of this
has been directed at renewable energy sources the share of our carbonneutral production was 76 in 2013

our farreaching investments need to be supported by a stable predictable operating environment it is rejoicing that the roadmap spanning to 2050 with a
lowcarbon finland as the goal is being drawn up by a parliamentary committee appointed in 2013 the work enables a review spanning election periods
in the bestcase scenario the review will provide the operating environment with the desired forecasting features


future challenges tackled through joint resources
pohjolan voima effectively produces and supplies electricity and heat for its shareholders at cost price in this way we secure the success of our customers
and our operations indirectly create jobs and wellbeing for society as a whole in 2013 we did well in this task creating possibilities for future success in the
process i wish to warmly thank our employees shareholders and partners

we will also tackle future challenges through joint resources

process steam for local industry and communities and also electricity heat production in 2013 was 66 twh ie at the same level as in 2012

thermal power plants produced a total of 52 twh of electricity of which 30 twh was at joint production plants of heat and electricity the electricity
production of thermal power plants increased by 40 from the previous year this was affected by the cold first part of the year and the increase in
industrys need for thermal power

compared to 2012 separate production of electricity produced in condensing power plants doubled to 22 twh the production of condensing power
increased substantially from the previous year due to the weaker hydrological situation in the nordic countries

the decrease in the net import volume of electricity and especially the decrease in finnish hydropower production almost doubled coal consumption
compared to the previous year the use of woodbased fuels in heat and electricity production increased slightly from the previous year and exceeded 8
twh for the first time the use of recycled fuels ref remained at the level of previous years peat use for fuel decreased by 15 from the previous year
this was affected by the poor peat summer and the poor availability of peat in 2013 thermal power plants consumed 80 twh of coal 81 twh of wood
fuels 17 twh of peat and 04 twh of recycled fuel oil and natural gas are used as start and backup fuel

longterm management of the water environment
hydropower production has regional and local impacts on waterways and fish stocks in order to fulfil its obligation to sustain the fish stocks of the kemijoki
and iijoki waterways and the sea area pvovesivoima oy stocked around 25 million fry in 2013 together with kemijoki oy 48 million fry were stocked in
the kemijoki sea and river area of these pvovesivoima oys share was 17 or 08 million fry



          did you know
              iijoki and kemijoki fell short of the goals for transporting river lamprey past dams in iijoki the number transported was 21000
              whereas the annual obligation is 60000 on the kemijoki river the shared obligation of pvovesivoima and kemijoki oy is 100000
              transported specimens in 2013 the number transported in kemijoki was only slightly more than one third 35000 in total of the
              obligation the obligations are evened out yearspecifically in good years the number transported exceeds the obligation in 2013
              the fishing of transported river lamprey was made difficult by the exceptionally warm and dry autumn the slow river flow and the
              low seawater level the migration of the river lamprey is tied to the flow volume of the rivers and the dominant strong westerly and
              southwesterly winds which raise the sea level


in cooperation with the iijoki regions municipalities and other key operators pvovesivoima oy participates in the iijoki fishway project managed by north
ostrobothnia ely centre the goal is to draw up detailed fishway plans for the power plants in the lower part of iijoki river and to apply for fishway
construction permits applying for permits requires the establishment of a joint municipal administration body

in 2013 inspections held regularly every five years according to the dam safety act took place at the pahkakoski and haapakoski dams

hydropower renovation scheme decreased oil damage risk

the new technology adopted within the hydropower renovation programme has resulted in considerable environmental improvements compared to earlier
technology the risk of oil damage has decreased substantially as water instead of the previously used oil is now the lubricant of pole bearings of renewed
turbines


production affects thermal power emissions
pohjolan voimas thermal power plants use wood fuel peat coal and refusederived fuels as primary fuels and some natural gas and oil as auxiliary fuels
the most significant environmental impact of thermal power production concerns the atmosphere the power plants emissions into the air vary according to
the fuel and the production volumes of electricity and thermal power

in 2013 the carbon dioxide emissions of thermal power production increased to 34 million tonnes this was caused by the growth of condensing
production which uses coal at the same time the characteristic emissions from electricity production increased to 192 g co2kwh

the industrial emissions ie directive which entered into force in january 2011 poses a major challenge to the future of thermal power production in
finland the directive will be enforced through the upgrade of the environmental protection act and some related decrees the directive establishes
extremely rigorous requirements on power plants emissions into the air these requirements will not however apply to existing power plants until in 2016
at the earliest to most of pohjolan voimas power plants the biggest challenges lie in cutting nitrogen oxide nox and particle emissions pohjolan voima
is currently investigating potential technological means of reducing emission levels


more extensive reutilisation of byproducts
the aim of pohjolan voima is to reuse a maximum share of the byproducts of thermal power production as raw material that could replace nonrenewable
natural resources such as rock and stone

a total of 320000 tonnes of fly ash bottom ash and gypsum were produced fly ash and gypsum as byproducts from flue gas cleaning in the context of the
power plants combustion process of this volume 81 was reutilised in earth construction the construction industry or as forest fertiliser through the
increase in thermal power production the amount of byproducts was higher but their utilisation reached a new level 80 in 2012 the utilisation
percentage was 64 this is largely explained by the construction of the sampaanala field in rauma with the ash of rauman biovoima oys power plant
the ash had been stored for the project from previous years



       geoteko prize awarded to rauman biovoima
           rauman biovoimas field project was granted the 2013 geoteko recognition award for leading the way in economic and ecological

nuclear power production complies with environmental permits
the operations of the nuclear power plant units owned by tvo a joint venture partially owned by pohjolan voima complied with the companys
environmental policy environmental permits and environmental management system

the greatest environmental impact of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant results from the heat released into the sea via cooling waters any other
environmental effects are negligible as was the case in previous years radioactive emissions into the air and water were minimal and considerably below
the authorised limits

projects
pohjolan voima actively finds designs and implements energy solutions for the challenges of the future in this millennium we have invested
4 billion in carbonneutral production of hydropower thermal power and nuclear power of this renewable energy accounts for 15 billion
the proportion of our carbonfree production will increase to 90 within a few years we do our part in securing a carbonneutral future in
2050

in 2013 an eightyear hydropower renovation scheme was completed in iijoki an extensive bioenergy scheme introduced a biogasification plant for our
partnership company vaskiluodon voima in vaasa rauman biovoima decided to invest in recycled fuels the years of major investments related to nuclear
power plants in olkiluoto


hydropower renovation project concluded in iijoki
the renovation of the pahkakoski hydropower plant in iijoki was completed in the spring the renovated machine 2 was introduced before the spring flood
season the renovation of machine 1 was completed in the spring 2012 the renovation included new turbines new generator stators basic maintenance
of generator rotors and the renewal of electrical and automation systems

the pahkakoski renovation marked the completion of the extensive renovation scheme of four hydropower plants in iijoki the renovation has provided 20
mw of new hydropower capacity which is renewable and very suitable for use as load


hydropower renovation continues in melo at kokemäenjoki
hydropower renovation continues in melo at kokemäenjoki the melo power plant will be renovated in 2014 and 2015 the generator stators will be
replaced and the electricity and automation systems will be modernised the plant completed in 1971 was renovated in 1999


additional machinery to be built at harjavalta hydropower plant
a decision was made to build a third machine at the harjavalta hydropower plant of partnership company länsisuomen voima this is one of the highest
capacity power plants in southern finland and its current capacity of 73 mw will increase by 22 mw the plan is to build the new machine in 2016

with the additional machinery it will be possible to reduce the need for diversion to improve the plants utilisation rate and to make for an easier joint use of
kokemäenjoki power plants the project also promotes flood control


kollaja projects natura assessments approved by authorities
through environment reviews and dialogue pohjolan voima has been developing the kollaja project for years in a totally new way so that the project could
be implemented by respecting natural values and retaining the characteristics of rapids

in june 2013 pohjolan voima submitted the requested additional reviews to the ely centre of northern ostrobothnia in regard to the assessments of the
kollaja projects impact on the natura values of the venkaa spring and pudasjärvi in early january 2014 the centre approved the reviews the centre
states that the project will have no significant impact on the natural values of the area

the kollaja project would provide the region with many benefits

when implemented the kollaja project would improve flood protection produce emissionfree energy and help increase finlands selfsufficiency in energy
production it would provide the increasingly necessary domestic loadfollowing production capacity to balance out gaps between energy consumption and

worlds largest biomass gasification plant was inaugurated in vaasa
the worlds largest biomass gasification plant was inaugurated in vaskiluoto vaasa in march it is the 16th biopower plant built within pohjolan voimas
extensive bioenergy programme

thanks to the new gasification plant 2540 of the coal used by the vaskiluoto power plant can be replaced by domestic biofuels mainly wood chips in
the gasification method developed in finland biofuels are converted to biogas which can be burned in a coal boiler the fuel capacity of the biogasification
plant is 140 mw

the plant has a positive impact on the regions economy and employment the use of bioenergy substantially reduces the power plants carbon dioxide
emissions

construction work at vaskiluodon voimas biogasification plant began in autumn 2011 vaskiluodon voima is jointly owned by pohjolan voima and epv
energia biogasification at the plant commenced in late 2012


rauman biovoima to invest in recycled fuels
rauman biovoima invested in recycled fuels by acquiring a new receipt and processing system for recycled fuels the investment will substantially increase
the use of recycled fuels at the power plant of rauman biovoima

once the investment has been completed the volume of recycled fuels can be brought up to about 90000 tonnes per year the recycled fuel used by the
plant mainly consists of energy waste gathered from retail and industrial facilities as well as wooden demolition waste that cannot be utilised in other ways

the construction work begins in spring 2014 and the installation of the equipment in early summer the equipment will be introduced in the autumn of
2014


biocoal research project includes reviews on replacing coal in energy production
pohjolan voimas subsidiary pvolämpövoima is involved in a research project on the potential of biocoal torrefied biomass in partially replacing coal in
coalfired power plants

in the project pvolämpövoima studies the integration of torrefaction to the power plant process and finds out the potential for using biocoal in heat and
electricity production biocoal is renewable fuel which is produced from wood chips through torrefaction or steam processing the material created can be
made into pellets or briquettes biocoal can be burned in coalfired power plants together with coal the use of biocoal would reduce the plants carbon
dioxide emissions

other parties to the joint project include upm valmet and helsingin energia the project has been funded by tekes


years of major investments will continue in nuclear power

operating environment
in 2013 electricity consumption in finland was 839 twh 852 twh in 2012 of this volume 682 677 twh was produced in finland while net imports
into finland amounted to 157 174 twh net imports remained high and covered 187 205 of finnish power consumption the good water
situation in the nordic countries in 2012 continued to be reasonably good in early 2013 which increased the amount of imports process industry
production showed signs of recovery although the challenges in the export industry and the exceptionally warm year caused total energy consumption to
decrease by 1 from the previous year industrial power consumption increased by 1 whereas the power consumption of other sectors was 35 lower
than in the previous year due to the warm weather

nord pool spot trade amounted to 493 twh 432 twh the annual average system price was 3810 3120 per mwh while the annual average of the
finnish area price was 4116 3664 per mwh finlands higher area price was affected by the good water situation in norway and sweden and by
capacity fees which limited russian imports

power plants the most difficult thing is the reduction of nitrogen oxide nox and particle emissions and studies are being conducted on different technical
solutions

major legal actions pending
in 2012 teollisuuden voima filed a claim and a rejoinder in the arbitration procedure compliant with the rules of the international chamber of commerce
icc on the delay of the construction of the ol3 plant unit and the related costs the estimated costs and losses amounted to approximately 18 billion
including the actual claim and an estimated sum

the arbitration procedure began in december 2008 at the initiative of the ol3 plant supplier the monetary demand updated by the plant supplier in 2013
and spanning until the end of june 2011 is about 27 billion in total among other things the sum includes about 70 million in postponed payment items
pursuant to the plant delivery contract about 700 million in interest in arrears and about 120 million in lost profit

teollisuuden voima has declared the plant suppliers previous claim to be unjustified teollisuuden voima will investigate the updated claim and will
address it accordingly the arbitration may take several years and the figures in the parties demands may still change

no receivables or provisions have been recognised as a result of the demands presented during the arbitration proceedings

the agreement between the finnish state and pvovesivoima on the use of iijoki hydropower owned by the state at four power plants expired at the end
of 2005 the permit authority granted pvovesivoima the permanent right in 2008 and set the consideration at 225 million metsähallitus appealed
against the decision to the vaasa administrative court which in its decision in 2010 declared the decision of the northern finland environmental permit
authority valid metsähallitus appealed to the supreme administrative court which issued a decision in august 2013 according to the statement pvo
vesivoima had to pay 115 million to metsähallitus for the permanent right to use hydropower owned by the state the remuneration for the permanent
right to use the hydropower has been entered in intangible assets for the 2013 financial period in addition metsähallitus demands an interest for the
remuneration for 20062013 in that case the remuneration increases to about 159 million pohjolan voima considers the interest claim to be excessive
no reservation has been entered for the interest claim and any interest to be paid will be activated in intangible assets which will not be depreciated

future outlook
the construction and preproduction preparation of the ol3 nuclear power plant unit continues in february 2014 teollisuuden voima announced that the
supplier has not provided the requested update of the ol3 projects overall schedule the launch time for electricity production at the ol3 plant unit will be
specified once the plant suppliers schedule report is ready

the preparations of the ol4 nuclear power plant project progress investigation into the licensability and suitability of plant alternatives continue together
with the procurement process aiming at making a selection between the alternatives

in late 2012 posiva submitted to the government an application for a construction permit for a spent nuclear fuel disposal facility posiva is continuing the
construction work furnishing and surveys in onkalo the underground research facility on the disposal of spent fuel in olkiluoto and preparing for the
launch of the encapsulation plant and final disposal facility projects fullscale testing of final disposal technology has started in onkalo

the kollaja plan was updated and the environmental impact assessment was supplemented as required by the authority the authority issued a statement
on 3 january 2014 and stated that the project does not substantially weaken natura values in the pudasjärvi river delta and venkaa spring areas in the
impact zone of the project there is an assertion in the government programme stating that the rapids protection act will not be reformed which is why
the kollaja project is not likely to progress while this government remains in power

due to a notification the gasifier premium included in the act on production subsidy for electricity produced from renewable energy sources is still being
processed by the european commission

the finnish parliament ratified the power plant tax act as a budgetary act in december the sum to be collected with the power plant tax decreased from
the previous 170 million to 50 million the act will take effect through a separate regulation once approved by the commission the commission will give
its response to finland in the next few months it is unclear how the act will apply to 2014 if approved by the commission in the middle of the year if the act
takes effect in the form presented it will substantially increase hydropower costs and also nuclear power costs

in december the parliament approved the governments updated energy and climate strategy the work of the parliamentary committee preparing a
national roadmap to 2050 has progressed slower than expected the roadmap is likely to be completed in 2014 as defined in the governments policy the
goal is to decrease peat use so that peat is not replaced by coal the peat tax will increase at the beginning of 2015

the parliament will start processing the reform of the environmental protection act and the estimate is that the reformed act will take effect in mayjune
2014 at the earliest according to the transition regulations in the proposed environmental protection act the deadline for submitting large combustion
plants environment permit inspection applications is 30 june 2014 there may be changes to the deadline in regard to other plants than the ones in
transition plans due to the fact that the estimated approval time of the act is near the authority processing of permit applications is an urgent tasks
because the new regulations stipulate that the environment permits should be valid until the start of 2015 so that emissions limit value flexibility can be
used for example

the updating of the best usable technology comparison document lcpbref is currently going on in the eu as a result of the industrial emissions
regulation bat conclusions made on the basis of new bref documents are binding on the basis of the bat conclusion drafts for large combustion
plants it is estimated that the emissions limit values become tighter bat conclusions are likely to be approved in 2015 at the earliest after which time the
need to update the environment permits will be assessed

the national transition plan in compliance with the industrial emissions regulation gives power plants more time to adjust to the tighter emissions
requirements until the end of june 2020 finlands national transition plan is still waiting for commission approval the commissions estimate is that the

borrowing costs

borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless they are directly attributable to construction of a power plant
in which case they are capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset

income taxes

pvo delivers electricity and heating to its shareholders at cost price the shareholders are delivered a proportionate share of the energy generated or
procured by pvo according to their proportionate ownership in the various series of shares based on the cost based pricing the group does not pay any
taxes on its energy related operations therefore the group does recognise any deferred tax assets or liabilities on these operations

income taxes and deferred taxes are recognised on the other hand on the services provided by the group

the tax expense for the period comprises current tax relating to the current period and any adjustments made to taxes for the previous financial period and
deferred taxes the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted the taxes for the current period are adjusted if necessary
by the taxes related to the previous period

deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements however deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or
liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred
tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the undistributed profits of the subsidiaries if it is not probable that
the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future the most significant temporary differences for the group arise from the depreciation of
property plant and equipment losses carried forward and the fair valuation of assets at acquisition

deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date deferred income tax assets are recognised
only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised

intangible assets

intangible assets are carried at historical cost less government grants received accumulated amortisation and impairment historical cost includes all costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of the intangible asset intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised using the straightline method over the
following estimated useful lives

computer software                        310 years
other intangible assets                  510 years

no amortisation is recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets with infinite useful lives instead these assets are tested annually for
impairment intangible assets having infinite useful lives are water rights that have an infinite useful life based on the water act and certain
utilisation rights for transmission roads and land based on the act on the redemption of immoveable property and special rights

emission allowances

carbon dioxide co2 emission allowances are included in the intangible assets emission allowances are recognised at cost whether received free of
charge or acquired from a third party emission allowances received free of charge are in other words recorded at zero a short term liability is recognised
to cover the obligation to return emission allowances to the extent that group already holds allowances to meet the obligation the liability is measured at
the carrying amount of those allowances any shortfall of allowances held over the obligation is valued at the current market value of allowances emission
right and the related liability are derecognised when they are returned to cover the obligation or when they are sold emission allowances are not amortised
the cost of the provision is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within materials and services gains from sales of emission rights are
presented in other income

property plant and equipment

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less government grants received less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated
impairment historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets borrowing costs directly attributable to the
acquisition or construction of assets that necessarily take a substantial amount of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost



 32                                                                                                                  pohjolan voima  annual report 2013

of the related asset additionally the cost of an item of property plant and equipment includes the discounted estimated cost of its dismantlement removal
or restoration

land and water areas are not depreciated depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straightline method to allocate their cost or revalued
amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives the costs for dismantling a power plant are depreciated over the estimated useful life of
the specific power plant

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated
useful lives as follows

the assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate to reflect the changes in estimated future economic benefits
associated with the assets

if the asset consists of different components which have different estimated useful lives each component is recognised as a separate asset replaced
components are capitalized and any possible remaining carrying value of the replaced component is derecognised in other cases subsequent costs are
included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the asset will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

annual repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred power plant
modernization and improvements are recognised in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate

gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other operating income or
other operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income

depreciation on assets classified as held for sale according to ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations is ceased

government grants

grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will
comply with all attached conditions government grants relating to the purchase of property plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of
the asset and are recognised as income by reducing the depreciation charge of the asset they relate to government grants relating to costs are deferred
and recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate
these grants are presented in other operating income

inventories

inventories are stated at cost cost is determined using the firstin firstout fifo method the cost of inventory comprises raw materials and other direct
costs inventories are always stated at cost as the energy generation operations are conducted based on cost price and therefore the cost of inventory is
always equal to its net realizable value

leases

leases group as lessee

finance leasing

property plant and equipment leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred by the lessor to the group are
classified as finance leases finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the
present value of the minimum lease payments the property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the
useful life of the asset and the lease term the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in other current and noncurrent
liabilities each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges the interest element of the finance cost is charged to the statement of
comprehensive income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period

if a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount shall not be immediately recognised as
income by a sellerlessee instead it shall be deferred and amortised over the lease term if the leaseback is an operating lease and the lease payments
and the sale price are at fair value there has in effect been a normal sale transaction and any profit or loss is recognised immediately ias 39 is applied for
the collateralized financial liabilities that are resulted from sale and leaseback transactions that do not contain a lease in substance the liability is amortised


 33                                                                                                             pohjolan voima  annual report 2013

at cost each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges according to the effective interest method

operating leases

leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases payments made
under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

rental income from operating lease contracts where the group acts as the lessor are recorded in other operating income on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease

leases the group as lessor

leases of property plant and equipment where the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are classified as
finance leases the lease income is recorded as a receivable at its present value the interest element of the lease income is recorded to the
comprehensive statement of income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the asset for
each period

operating leases of property plant and equipment where the group acts as the lessor are included in the property plant and equipment in the balance
sheet these assets are in the same way as assets in groups own use depreciated over their useful life rental income is recorded on a straight line basis
over the period of the lease

arrangements containing a lease agreement

the group has entered into arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but conveys a right to use an asset in return for a payment of series of
payments and therefore contains a lease in order to determine if the arrangement includes a finance lease component or other lease agreement the criteria
in ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease is used determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whethera fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or
assets the asset and

b the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset

if the arrangement includes a lease ias 17 is applied to determine whether it is an operating or financial lease as described above other elements of the
arrangement are recognised according to the relevant standards

impairment of nonfinancial assets

the individual assets carrying values are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if there is an indication
of impairment the asset is tested for impairment goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets in progress are not subject to
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment regardless of there is indication of impairment or not impairment for assets excluding goodwill is
assessed at the cashgenerating unit cgu level which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely
independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets goodwill is tested for impairment at the level at which it is monitored by
management which may be an individual cgu or groups of cgus but is not tested at a level higher than an operating segment

an assets recoverable amount is the higher of a cashgenerating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use value in use is the estimated
discounted future cash flows expected to be provided by the asset or group of assets the discount rates used are pretax and reflect current market
assessments of the time value of money and specific risks relating to the relevant asset or group of assets

where the carrying value of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable
amount impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income impairment arising from a goodwill impairment test is allocated
first to goodwill and any excess thereafter rateably over the other assets in the cgu assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment charge are
reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment if the estimates used in the calculation of the recoverable amount have changed a reversal of an
impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount net of amortisation or depreciation that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset in prior years impairment losses on goodwill are never reversed

financial assets and financial liabilities

purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the tradedate at fair value financial assets are derecognised when the rights to
receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of
ownership

the group classifies its financial assets in the following categories financial assets at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables and available
for sale financial assets the classification is determined at initial recognition and depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading or initially designated in this category derivatives are categorised as
held for trading unless they are designated as hedges all derivatives held by the group are classified as financial assets at fair value trough profit or loss



 34                                                                                                               pohjolan voima  annual report 2013

as hedge accounting is not applied by the group derivatives in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months
otherwise they are classified as noncurrent when the derivatives have a negative value they are classified as financial liabilities held for trading liabilities
in this category are classified as current liabilities if expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are classified as noncurrent gains or losses
arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the statement of comprehensive
income in the period in which they arise

loans and receivables

loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and not held for sale
the groups loans and receivables comprise trade and loan receivables loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest method they are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period these are
classified as noncurrent assets trade receivables are recorded at cost which corresponds to their fair value loans granted which have a maturity date
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method loans lacking a maturity date are valued at cost

availableforsale financial assets

availableforsale financial assets are nonderivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories they are
included in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period
availableforsale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently valued at fair value unquoted securities
for which fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost changes in the unrealized fair value of availableforsale financial assets are
recognised in other comprehensive income within the fair value reserve changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income
when the asset is sold or when it has been impaired the availableforsale financial assets held by the group comprise unquoted securities valued at cost
there is no active market for the securities and pvo has no intention to dispose of these securities

cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand deposits held at call with banks and other shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less

impairment of financial assets

the group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired
a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred in the statement of comprehensive income only if there is
objective evidence of impairment if in a subsequent period the fair value of an availableforsale financial asset increases the impairment loss of an equity
instrument is not reversed through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the group recognises an impairment of trade receivables if there
is objective evidence that the receivable will not be paid in full

financial liabilities

financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred financial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortised cost any
difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the
period of the borrowings using the effective interest method

fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all of the facility
will be drawn down in this case the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs to the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the
facility will be drawn down the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates

derivative instruments are recognised as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss these are recognised similarly as financial assets at fair value
through profit or loss they are included in noncurrent liabilities unless the liability is settled within 12 months of the end of the reporting period

derivative instruments

derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value the
method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is hedge accounted

teollisuuden voima oyj tvo a joint venture of the group is consolidated using the equity method see

associates and joint ventures under the notes to the financial statements tvo uses derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate
risk in fuel purchases as well as the foreign currency risk and interest rate risk in borrowings denominated in foreign currencies hedge accounting
according to ias 39 is applied to foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swap contracts hedging foreign currency risk in procurement
contracts of uranium in addition hedge accounting is applied to some of the interest rate swap contracts entered into hedging the fluctuations in cash flows
of interest payments on borrowings tvo documents its assessment both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis of whether the derivatives that are
used in the hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the cash flows of the hedged itemtvo applies both cash flow and fair value hedge
accounting the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other
comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedge instruments relating to the ineffective



 35                                                                                                                pohjolan voima  annual report 2013

portion is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income and costs unless they are capitalized as a part of an
investment in a power plant changes in fair values accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit
or loss when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting any cumulative gain or loss
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and are recognised in profit or loss only when the forecasted transaction is also recognised in profit
or loss when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised in the
statement of comprehensive income any changes in the fair value of the interest rate options and some interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards
for which hedge accounting is not applied are presented in the finance income and costs unless they relate to the building of a power plant and are
capitalised as a part of the asset

tvo applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings that are quoted the gain or loss relating to the effective portion of
interest derivatives hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the profit or loss within finance costs the carrying amount of hedged borrowings and fair
values of derivatives hedging them are considered part of interest bearing liabilities and assets if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting the adjustments to the carrying amount of a hedged borrowing is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity

tvo presents fair value changes relating to nonhedge accounted interest rate options and certain interest rate swaps within finance costs as regards those
are not capitalised in the cost of the power plant under construction

other companies in the group have derivative instruments that do not fulfil the hedge accounting criteria according to ias 39 examples of these
instruments are some interest rate swap agreements which have been used to exchange floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings and foreign
currency forward contracts hedging the foreign currency risk in fuel purchases derivatives are recorded at fair value in the assets or liabilities changes in
the fair values of foreign currency forwards and interest rate derivative instruments are recorded through profit and loss within finance income and costs
derivatives are classified as current or noncurrent assets or liabilities depending on their maturity date

employee benefits

pensions for the personnel in the group have been arranged through an external pension insurance company the finnish tyel pension system as well
as the voluntary pension insurances are recognised as defined contribution plans a defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group
pays fixed contributions into a separate entity the group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold
sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods payments made to the defined contribution
plans are recognised as expenses in the period in which they were incurred defined benefit plans are plans that are not defined contribution plans the
group does not have any defined contribution plans

provisions and contingent liabilities

provisions for environmental restoration asset retirement obligations and legal claims are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably
estimated

provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pretax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised
as interest expense where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party the reimbursement is
recognised when and only when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received provisions are not recognised for operating costs

a contingent liability is disclosed when there is a possible obligation that arises from external events and whose existence is only confirmed by one or more
doubtful future events or when there is an obligation that is not recognised as a liability or provision because it is not probable that on outflow of resources
will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably estimated contingent liabilities are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements

environmental provisions

environmental provisions are recognised based on current interpretation of environmental laws and regulations when it is probable that a present
obligation has arisen and the amount of such liability can be reliably estimated environmental expenditures resulting from the remediation of an existing
condition caused by past operations and which do contribute to current or future revenues are expensed as incurred

accrued expenses related to the handling of ashes

group companies may have in temporary storage ashes generated from the power plant operations which are subject to waste tax these ashes may
have an alternative utilisation an alternative utilisation is being sought or there is no alternative utilisation which will result in the ashes being transported to
a waste disposal site financial statements include an accrued expense representing the best estimate for the costs of the handling of the ashes held in
temporary storage at the end of the reporting period




 36                                                                                                               pohjolan voima  annual report 2013

asset retirement obligations

an asset retirement obligation is recognised either when there is a contractual or a legal obligation and the obligation amount and timing can be reliably
estimated the asset retirement obligation is recognised as part of the cost of an item of property and plant when the asset is put in service or when
contamination occurs the costs are depreciated over the remainder of the assets useful life

assets and liabilities relating to nuclear waste management

the treatment of the nuclear waste management liability has a material effect on the profit and loss of teollisuuden voima oyj tvo the nuclear waste
management liability based on the nuclear energy act is covered by a contribution to the national waste management fund the liability covers all future
costs for the handling of the existing nuclear waste including the decommissioning of the nuclear power plants and final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel

in the consolidated financial statements of tvo the share of the funds in the national waste management fund is presented as part of noncurrent assets
according to ifric 5 the nuclear waste management liability is presented in provisions within noncurrent liabilities present value of the nuclear waste
management liability is calculated by discounting the cash flows based on the planned estimated future operations and their costs taking into account the
already realized operations

the initial present value of the provision for decommissioning of the nuclear power plant is included in the capitalized investment cost of the power plant
the initial present value is adjusted according to subsequent planned future changes the cost for decommissioning of the plant is depreciated over the
estimated useful life of the power plant

the provisions made for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel at the end of the reporting period covers all the future cost for final disposal the cost of the final
disposal of the spent nuclear fuel is recognised over the time the nuclear fuel is being used any planned changes are recognised immediately in the
statement of comprehensive income based on the spent nuclear fuel at the end of the reporting period

the time value of money when discounting the nuclear waste management liability is recognised by recording the interest expense in the statement of
comprehensive income

share capital

pvo has 19 different series of shares each series of shares entitle their owner to the energy generated by a specific subsidiary associate or joint venture
each shareholder is entitled to the proportionate share of the energy according to their proportionate ownership of a specific series of shares

equity loans to shareholders

equity loans to shareholders are classified as equity instruments and recognized initially at fair value including transaction costs the equity loans do not
have a maturity date and the debtor can repay the loan at will in one or several tranches the debtors board of directors has discretion over the coupon
interest payments for the loan unpaid interest does not accumulate to the subsequent periods the equity loan is unsecured and is subordinate to all other
forms of debt instruments but senior to the companys other equity instruments

the interest for the equity loans is recognized as a liability only after entity has decided to pay the interest the relating interest expense is recognized on a
cash basis directly in retained earnings and not through the consolidated income statement

segment reporting

segment reporting according to ifrs 8 applies only to individual financial statements of an entity whose debt or equity instruments are traded in a public
market or an entity that is in the process of filing its financial statements with a securities commission or other regulatory organization for the purpose of
issuing any class of instruments in a public market pohjolan voima oys shares are not publicly traded and it has not issued any debt or equity

market risk

interest rate risk
changes in interest rates on the interestbearing receivables and liabilities create an interest rate risk the interest rate risk in the loan portfolio of the parent
company and subsidiaries is managed by changing the interest rate period and the duration the objective of the interest rate risk management in pohjolan
voima is to obtain the lowest possible interest expense and to reduce the volatility of interest expenses in accordance with the financing policy of the
group the duration of the loan portfolio of pohjolan voima is monitored separately for each series of shares the duration of the loan portfolios of the parent
company and subsidiaries are set at the level where the electricity price sensitivity to changes in interest rates is on an acceptable level considering the
individual riskbearing capacity of each series of shares


the interest rate period of loan portfolios in the parent company and subsidiaries may be changed with fixed rate loans interestrate swaps forward rate
agreements and interest rate cap and floor agreements subsidiaries interest rate hedges are made so that the counterparty is always the parent company
the parent company will then enter into a corresponding contract with a bank


currency risk
pohjolan voima group is exposed to foreign currency risk mainly due to fuel purchases both shortterm and longterm loans are mainly denominated in
euros other than the eurodenominated borrowings are hedged latest at the time when the loan is drawn


coal purchases are made almost entirely in us dollars because purchase agreements for coal are entered into up to 10 months in advance before delivery
and payment the euro versus dollar exchange rate changes will affect coal prices and thus also impact the price of electricity produced the weakening of
the euro leads to exchange losses and the strengthening of the euro leads to exchange gains


the changes in foreign exchange rates are hedged for the undelivered contracts pvo hedges only purchases that are based on signed contracts or that
are secured by derivative financial agreements consequently hedging is made on the date of the derivative contract or on the order date and it covers the
period to the expected payment date of the coal delivery hedging is reversed in line with the payment of delivery batches cost of hedging is allocated to
the cost of each batch of coal and therefore included in the production costs of each production facility if the terms of delivery of the coal batches are
changed the hedging will be changed in line with the change of the terms of delivery


currency swaps forward contracts and options can be used for the currency risk hedging

fair value estimation

carrying value of receivables and other receivables with variable interest rates are calculated using the effective interest method this is also a reasonable
estimate of their fair value shortterm trade and other receivables approximate their fair value as the effect of discounting is not significant for these
receivables due to their short maturities


availableforsale investments include investments in unlisted securities which are carried at acquisition cost because their fair values are not readily
available the group has no intention to dispose of these securities


carrying value of longterm loans and shortterm interestbearing liabilities is calculated using the effective interest method carrying value of loans with
variable interest rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value carrying value of shortterm interestbearing liabilities approximate their fair value as the
effect of discounting is not significant due to their short maturity fair value of loans with fixed interest rate is determined using a discounted cash flow
method discount rates used are the market interest rates at the closing date which were in between 02  22 01  16


derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value at the closing date the fair values reflect the
prices which pvo would have to pay or would receive if it called a derivatives contract fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted
cash flow method using market rates prevailing at the closing date as the discount rate which were 02  22 01  16 fair values of forward foreign
exchange contracts and swaps are determined using quoted forward rates from contracts with similar duration pvo does not apply hedge accounting
according to ias 39 so the changes in fair values for derivative instruments are recorded in profit or loss


according to ifrs 7 items measured at fair value are classified into three different levels for the notes depending on how much the fair values are based
on market information fair values of instruments categorized as level 1 are based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical
instruments fair values of level 2 instruments are derived either directly or indirectly from quoted prices and level 3 of the fair values are determined using
input data that is not based on observable market data only derivative financial inatruments are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and they are all
in level 2 in the fair value hierarchy
