 2014 key topics for cedec

     the year 2014 marked a new phase for europes energy
     framework with a new european commission a new
     european parliament and a new president of the european
     council the creation of an energy union and energy
     security are key priorities for europes policy makers

     energy has become one of the major challenges that
     the european union is currently facing the way energy
     is produced and consumed has a considerable impact
     on our environment economy and society faced with
     volatile energy prices and in the transition from a fossil
     based centralized energy system to a decarbonized and
     decentralizing energy environment european industries
     and consumers are spending an increasing share of their
     income on energy

     simultaneously greenhouse gas emissions have risen
     globally requiring rapid and decisive action the impor
     tance of decarbonisation of the energy system needs to
     take centre stage

     significant progress has been made in completing the
     internal energy market energy market integration in
     the eu has already delivered positive results but in
     order to obtain the full benefits and to realize the energy
     transition more investment is needed in crossborder
     infrastructure and smart distribution grids

     cedec has provided in 2014 strategical and technical po

cedec therefore analysed some different options such as           particular integrating elements from capacity tariffs and
a shift from largely volumebased tariffs to purely capacity       volume tariffs or prices
based grid tariffs as well as hybrid solutions

the analysis showed that current grid tariff structures
are largely based on the old energy environment this is
volume tariffs while capacity tariffs can bring an answer
to the challenges that dsos are confronted with today
already as distribution network costs are largely based on
capacity elements peak capacities for grids and connec
tions and not on the volume consumed
