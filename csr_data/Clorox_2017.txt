             innovating on innovation

             a conversation about how it happens
             innovation takes many forms at clorox  from developing a product that becomes a
             household name to advertising that creates buzz to an instore display that grabs attention
             here are perspectives on how weve been evolving to meet consumers changing needs
             from four senior leaders who help shepherd innovation throughout our organization chief
             innovation officer denise garner chief customer officer matt laszlo chief marketing
             officer eric reynolds and chief information officer manjit singh




             q how does the consumer inspire clorox innovation
                    denise garner  in rd the consumer is our muse we pay attention to what
                    consumers tell us they want in a product as well as observe their pain points to
                    identify unarticulated needs that present opportunities to innovate and delight
                    consider the new brita stream pitcher millennials wanted a highcapacity
                    pitcher that was streamlined enough to fit inside the refrigerator door delivered
                    fast filtration on demand and allowed them to add ice to the pitcher their
                    feedback inspired us to reinvent our filtration technology and pitcher design

                    manjit singh  consumers embrace of technologies such as voice integration
                    and inhome smart speakers has us asking how we can leverage them to make
                    products even more practical effective and easier to use the brita infinity
                    pitcher cloroxs first internet of things product is an example of how it
                    partners with other groups inside clorox to deliver a superior consumer
                    experience while were using our voice integration skills to improve consumers
                    experiences with our products in their homes


             q how has clorox innovation made a difference for our
                    retail customers
                    matt laszlo  it starts with putting the consumer first being able to meet
                    consumer needs through innovation makes us an extremely valuable effective
                    partner to our retailers we know that for many consumers scent can make
                    a mundane experience more enjoyable that approach has helped clorox
                    scentiva cleaners get off to a good start with strong retailer support

                                q how has your approach to innovation changed
                                      matt laszlo  were thinking about innovation more broadly than ever before not only
                                      are we developing new products but were also expanding our existing products to new
                                      spaces places and faces  for instance by placing clorox disinfecting wipes in the
                                      pharmacy section why is this important because consumers dont make all of their
                                      purchases in one place anymore  or even two or three places so we need to always
                                      look beyond traditional roles and rules to continue growing our business

                                      denise garner  weve enhanced our innovation processes from end to end so we can
                                      create bigger more sustainable ideas while moving at a faster pace  and minimize
                                      needed resources and costs in the process this positions us to meet everchanging
                                      consumer and retailer needs much more effectively and it gives us a much better
                                      chance of being first to market with an innovation were already seeing results with a
                                      stronger innovation pipeline




         q what does the next phase of innovation look like at clorox
               eric reynolds  its about creating a seamless consumer experience that
               means unlocking what motivates someone to purchase our products and
               bring them home

               take the brita infinity pitcher its not just a pitcher it connects to the internet
               and can reorder filters for all our brands we need to bring together the
               physical and digital experience  because people want an experience rather
               than just products

               matt laszlo  weve got to be more and more digitally enabled that could
               mean the product itself the packaging or the online content which educates
               influences and tells the consumer a story

               for example do you get a push notification from hidden valley ranch
               suggesting a recipe to try when youre walking down the dressings aisle
               or can we create packaging with more information on it for shoppers to
               engage with via their smartphones more and more our retailers want to
               play in the online world even for the instore experience our innovation




14   the clorox company 2017 integrated annual report

   needs to address the consumer desire for more education and interaction
   with our products

   manjit singh  its going to be all about speed with it involved from
   the start well be able to embed technology into our processes as
   well as our products to meet consumers everevolving needs


q in a crowded media landscape how does innovation
   strengthen your marketing efforts
   eric reynolds  the challenge for us is not the media landscape its all the
   information and noise the average person gets today

   to penetrate through with clear product ideas and messages we need to
   innovate everywhere including media because communication is a big
   piece of what were trying to do

   one area where were doing this is media planning whats worked well
   for decades  tv print digital  has started to fall as media consumption
   continues to shift and fragment across multiple channels and environments
   gaining consumers attention is challenging there are too many messages and
   channels and we need to break through this clutter so were changing the way
   we approach the question were trying to slide into their daytoday lives at
   just the right moment with a piece of information theyre open to receiving at
   that particular time



                      q how do you nurture the spirit of innovation
                           denise garner  we need to stay close to emerging trends with a laser focus
                           on our consumer our categories and our competition as well as on the retail
                           environment and overall global trends

                           then it is all about nurturing a sense of bold curiosity in our culture curiosity
                           can help unlock insights about our consumers and technology which can serve
                           as the foundation for innovation breakthroughs whether its adapting the
                           technology or discovering a new consumer need that helps us focus our product
                           development efforts

                           manjit singh  our curiosity has led us to establish relationships with organizations
                           such as research boards venture capital groups and investment firms which expose
                           us to earlystage innovations that can inspire new ideas and further improve our
                           speed to market we encourage our employees to tap these relationships to
                           learn more about technology advances that will allow us to discover innovative
                           ways to solve consumer needs


                                                                                                                   15

           upstream supply chain

           as the fifth year of our footprint reduction goal period comes to a close we have already exceeded our
           2020 goals to reduce solidwastetolandfill and water use and remain on target to reach our 2020 goals
           to lower energy use and greenhouse gas emissions our facilities are not energyintensive or waterintensive
           making ongoing progress challenging now that we have already reduced energy and water use by 23 percent
           and 33 percent respectively per case of product sold since establishing our first sustainability strategy in
           2008 nevertheless we continue to seek innovative ways to reduce our overall operational footprint

                   the board of directors and stockholders of the clorox company

                   we have reviewed selected quantitative performance indicators the subject matter included in exhibit a and

                   executive summary the reports for the year ended june 30 2017 or otherwise noted in accordance with the
                   criteria also set forth in exhibit a the criteria we did not review all information included in the reports we
                   did not review the narrative sections of the reports except where they incorporated the subject matter cloroxs
                   management is responsible for the subject matter included in exhibit a and as also presented in the reports in
                   accordance with the criteria our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the subject matter based on our review

                   our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the american institute of certified
                   public accountants those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about
                   whether any material modifications should be made to the subject matter in order for it to be in accordance with
                   the criteria a review consists principally of applying analytical procedures making inquiries of persons responsible
                   for the subject matter obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate
                   aggregate and report the subject matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
                   the circumstances a review is substantially less in scope than an examination the objective of which is to obtain
                   reasonable assurance about whether the subject matter is in accordance with the criteria in all material respects
                   in order to express an opinion accordingly we do not express such an opinion a review also does not provide
                   assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination we believe
                   that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion

                   as described in exhibit a the subject matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations
                   inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data the selection of different but acceptable
                   measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements the precision of different measurement
                   techniques may also vary

                   based on our review we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the selected
                   quantitative performance indicators for the year ended june 30 2017 or otherwise noted in order for it to
                   be in accordance with the criteria

                           corporate responsibility priorities
                           priorities and matrix
                           our corporate responsibility priorities are based on an exercise conducted in fiscal year 2016 to help us
                           focus our attention on the companys most important issues we are using the term corporate responsibility
                           priorities instead of materiality topics to avoid confusion with the term as it relates to key information that
                           can impact financial statements

                           the priorities and accompanying matrix were developed with support from a third party capturing key inputs
                           from the companys 2020 strategy which includes corporate responsibility commitments as well as feedback
                           from employees and numerous external stakeholders
