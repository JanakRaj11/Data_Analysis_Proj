     risk management
     every year we identify the major risks that could have a significant impact on stakeholders and promote our risk prevention measures
     each major risk is mapped out on a matrix evaluating degree of impact and frequency of occurrence from the viewpoints of damage
     to the brand and impact on personnel and financial consequences risks scoring high in risk points are flagged as priority risks and
     monitored by the risk management committee and risk mitigation activities are promoted throughout the entire group


     strengthening of compliance
     in order to prevent violations we believe that we must strengthen our management system and create an organization that respects
     compliance for this reason we developed two training courses throughout the business group namely interactive compliance
     training and compliance management training
