1 csr management system
  development
           11 identifying material aspects of csr activities
as part of preparing of the corporate social responsibility csr report for 2014 we implemented the material aspects
identification procedure recommended by new version g4 of the international gri guidelines this process aimed at identifying
the areas of our csr activities which are recognised as important by the bank management and represent an area of concern
for our stakeholders

firstly implementation of this analysis allowed us to form the basis for further csr work we understood which of the csr
areas and management processes must be built and improved secondly we used the analysis results to determine the content
of the report to make it more relevant and aimed at meeting the stakeholders information needs

                                      so that the report reflects both
                                      positive and negative impacts

explained in terms of corresponding gri guidelines aspects and indicators the topics located outside the orange zone on the
map were not recognised as material and according to gri guidelines are not required to be disclosed in the report neverthe
less we made the decision to include some of these topics in the report which might also be of interest to our stakeholders

to reduce the number of client complaints we took the following measures in 2014

          developed a new version of service standards  the guidelines for our employees on how to deal with clients and
            their complaints
          introduced standards for transactional procedures for the most common issues such as searching for and refunding
            payments and handling any transactions issues that involve selfservice machines to facilitate instantaneous
            assistance and prevent grievances

analysis of complaints in the group revealed that most often complaints are connected to issues that arise while a customer is
making payments depositing and withdrawing cash through atm and internet booking also our clients are not fully satisfied
with the quality of service and the terms of the products offered

           24 ensuring security
to ensure the privacy and security of personal data and clients funds we take organisational and technical measures covering
all service channels facetoface as well as remote in 2014 we achieved the following results in fighting fraud at sberbank

           71 attempts of theft of corporate funds and 87000 attempts of theft of individuals funds were prevented and the
             amount of prevented damage equals to rub 29 bn

             that made mass attacks on sberbank clients funds the criminals were arrested and prosecuted
           attempts of fraud for a total of rub 08 bn were detected and prevented in trade outlets that accept credit cards for
             payment through payment terminals of sberbank


            antiskimming measures

            due to an increasing number of selfservice machines we focus on antiskimming measures during the year we were
            implementing our preplanned technical security for selfservice machines against skimming we installed more than
            13000 sets of active antiskimming equipment and developed a system of interaction among sberbank branches to be
            used while checking reports of suspected skimming as a result 702 cases of possible skimming were prevented 142
            sets of skimming equipment were confiscated and about rub 47 bn of financial damage was avoided


we also continued to work on raising the level of security of our information systems to protect the personal data of our clients
in particular data leakloss prevention dlp system was introduced in 2014 and a certification audit of the main processing
centre of sberbank was conducted to comply with the international safety standards of the payment card industry pci dss

         25 procurement activities
increasing procurement efficiency

in order to raise purchasing efficiency we implement the process of centralisation of the purchasing function in the central
office which entered the final stage in 2014 we introduced a new organisational structure  centre for logistics  and launched
the supply transformation programme aimed at increasing the quality of purchasing and reducing the purchasing time we also
made some improvements in our regulatory framework with the following results

          a new draft of the regulations on purchasing was developed
          a new contract negotiation concept was introduced which significantly reduces signing time
          the share of standard contracts signed in the central office reached 735 69 in 2013

purchasing will be further expanded through the entire branch network of sberbank thus in 2014 the pilot projects to centralise
purchasing in northwest bank and central chernozyomny bank were already completed as a result a single purchasing unit
will be set up in each region what will make it possible to expand the purchasing volume and reduce the number of personnel
involved in purchasing activities

procurement from local suppliers and small businesses

we attracted about 6300 suppliers in the whole sberbank group in 2014 due to the specifics of our activity our main suppliers
are it companies on average 2030 of total sum spent on purchasing leaseholders advertising marketing and design
agencies providers of office equipment and stationary we try to buy from local businesses5 to support economic activity of

the share of this supplier category in the purchasing budget of sberbank was 33 in 2014 which considerably exceeds the 18
requirement set by the ministry of economic development under the road map improving the access of small and medium
sized businesses to procurements of infrastructure monopolies and stateowned companies


         26 compliance risk management
we are currently developing a uniform system for compliance risks management across the entire sberbank group the purpose
of this system is to ensure that our activity is in line with legal regulations and best business practices relative to

          fighting money laundering and financing of terrorism
          controlling the economic sanctions imposed by the russian federation international organisations and individual
            states
          supporting market behaviour and fair competition when making transactions on financial markets
          preventing use of insider information and price manipulation on financial markets
          managing conflict of interest and fighting corruption
          complying with any other ethical norms of employee conduct

to create the uniform system in 2013 we developed an organisational structure of compliance business units in sberbank
and in 2014 set up a compliance function in our subsidiary banks and the groups companies adopted unified methodological
approaches to managing compliance risks and implemented them among group members

furthermore one of our goals in 2014 was to develop initiatives aimed at promoting a complianceoriented model of the groups
employee conduct and maintaining a strong connection between employees behaviour and financial compensation with the
purpose of developing compliance culture and increasing the level of employee awareness we created training programmes
in different areas of compliance and provide regular employee trainings all employees are informed of the compliance
requirements upon employment and have facetoface or distance trainings

based on the evaluation results an anticorruption policy was developed which defines a number of interconnected principles
and procedures for fighting corruption in the bank and the group it covers all employee regardless of their position this policy
is the basis of the anticorruption programme of sberbank group and manifests the principle of the bank and the group not to
accept corruption in any form zero tolerance principle in 2014 the group members adopted and consistently implemented
their own internal documents and procedures to prevent corruption as required by the policy

the groups activities had a positive impact we observed a reduction in corruption records in the banks subsidiaries and zero
records among affiliated companies the number of corruption cases in sberbank decreased from 68 in 2013 to 11 in 2014

           31 ensuring availability of financial services
developing our branch network we aim to place our offices in convenient locations in order to gain as many customers as
possible using geomarketing technologies we identify areas with high concentration of customers and open customer service
outlets near the places where these people live work and study or open outlets close to major pedestrian traffic routes we
opened 302 service outlets in new places in 2014 while 545 service outlets were moved to other places and 1138 service
outlets were closed because of their inefficient location

when designing our network we are trying to provide equal access to our services to customers throughout russia including
underdeveloped and lowpopulated areas7 where doing business could be economically challenging while overall reduction of
number of service outlets in 2014 the share of branches in those regions increased by percentage point and constituted 27
we also continue to develop a network of selfservice machines during the reporting year the number of selfservice machines
increased by 15 in underdeveloped and lowpopulated areas

          improving banks services availability under the online village project

          we initiated a pilot project called online village to make our services available in small villages in remote areas the
          project included the following activities

           installation of free internet kiosks at the administrations and public institutions with access to banking services
             through sberbank online and sberbank business online to the personal account of network operators and to
             public services portal
           meetings and trainings of local customers on how to operate the remote banking services
           support of activists in promoting online services to the public

          in 2014 six regional banks participated in the project and 104 service outlets in 11 regions of russia were opened
          altai and stavropol territories tambov novgorod pskov tomsk kemerovo novosibirsk kirov nizhny novgorod
          and orenburg regions

          this project helped people in remote areas to repay loans pay for traffic fines and communication services pay for
          utilities and taxes without going to regional centres residents of villages will also be able to get access to a public
          services portal to schedule an appointment with a doctor to apply for a passport and to ask questions to the municipal
          authorities

or lifts and reception desks were installed at a lower level to implement a sittingsitting format of service a callbutton was
mounted near the office entrance so that disabled client can call for assistance and access the premises with help of a bank

         32 enhancing financial literacy
as a part of our efforts to improve the populations financial literacy we provide information about basic banking products form
a responsible attitude to personal finances and explain how to use new online services

working with the population we apply a targeted approach to its various categories one of our innovations was the launch of
a training programme targeted at specifically senior people  the socalled new opportunities club at the pensioners club
seminars we talk about banking products and teach senior people how to use online banking by means of easy and interactive
examples from real life

for young people we initiated a course of lectures about foundations of the financial system in our times entitled investing in the
future the course was specifically designed by lecturers from the plekhanov russian academy of economics and implemented
together with universarium elearning system we also launched our entertainment application financial games on three
social networks in 2014 the game idea is based on the popular tv show brain ring where participants must quickly answer
financial questions the application allows teams to compete in the same or between different social networks vkontakte
odnoklassniki and facebook and was installed by more than 239000 users

for children sberbank opened its office in the masterslavl moscow and kidburg st petersburg childrens centres
furthermore a day celebrating financial literacy for children in grades 15 was held on september 1st the day of knowledge
within this project children learn about banking careers in a simple game form pretending to be cashiers or collectors thus
the bank aims at generating a positive image of the profession and installing a habit of seeking help in banking institutions for
financial matters

at the beginning of the school year the bank launched the financy prosto specialised portal wwwfinprostoru which is the
basis of sberbanks communication programme to improve financial literacy on the portal users can receive detailed theoretical
information on existing financial products and services moreover it has features that motivate users to continue ongoing
training and to improve their knowledge in the financial area about 1 million unique visitors have visited the portal since it was

housing loans
an important social task for sberbank is to increase affordability of housing for the population for this purpose we adopted
a new customer service model for mortgage lending by expanding the network for acceptance of mortgage applications in
2014 now to file an application our customers do not need to go to the mortgage centre  they can apply at any bank office
with the sales manager or mortgage lending managers assistance in 2013 our clients were consulted by 2000 sberbank
professionals and in 2014 the number of qualified mortgage sales consultants increased to 20000 which significantly simplified
the populations access to mortgages

we raised salaries of employees in some sberbank units where a salary lag was found due to the increase in salaries and total
number of employees labour costs raised by approximately 13 in 2014

when using infrastructure facilities we generate some hazardous waste most of which is old office equipment cartridges
fluorescent lamps batteries and sediments caused by mechanical and biological sewage water treatment hazardous waste is
also generated in maintenance of the corporate car fleet used lubricants tires oiled rags oiled sand etc weve been working
on the improvement of our hazardous waste management system over the last three years as a result 98 of the hazardous
waste we generated in 2014 was recycled or neutralised

5 about the report
sberbank has been publishing nonfinancial reports since 2010 and this is the second corporate social responsibility report
of sberbank group hereinafter referred to as the report our main objective in the development of the reporting system in
2014 was to unify the approach to data collection at subsidiary banks and affiliated companies all over the group for their
consolidation we are just at the beginning of this process but already in this reporting period we have managed to disclose
more csr indicators of the group in comparison to the previous year from now forward we will continue to improve the
methods and forms of data collection for the report within the group

another innovation for the year 2014 was the transition to the new g4 version of the gri guidelines basic version the new
version focuses on identifying material aspects of the companys csr activities and stakeholder engagement during this
process for compliance with the requirements we undertook a poll of our stakeholders and top management of sberbank
read more about the procedure for identifying the material aspects and its results in section 11 identifying material aspects
of csr activities

in the reporting period we specified the criteria for including subsidiaries in the report boundaries for the 2014 report we
used the following criteria

          control of sberbank over the subsidiaries ownership of over 50 of shares
          materiality of the influence of the subsidiaries on the stakeholders in the regions of operation over 60 employees
          financial operations in the field of the main business of the group or supplementary functions for implementation
            of the main business of sberbank

in comparison to the previous reporting period sberbank switzerland was included in the report boundaries and korus
consulting cis was excluded the definition of sberbank group was modified in accordance with the updated report boundaries
therefore the information and data in the report relate to the following

          sberbank ojsc sberbank of russia with its head office and 16 regional banks of the russian federation
          subsidiary banks that are listed in table 27

the key methodical changes as compared to the 2013 report are as follows

            unification of the method for defining underdeveloped and lowpopulated areas for the group they represent top
              level political units where the population density is below the national average and which belong to the 25 of
              regions with the lowest average income per capita
            in table 16 main socially oriented products of sberbanks housing loans credit disbursements for the product
              military mortgage are indicated for 2013 and 2014 years respectively while in the 2013 report this indicator
              contained disbursements since the launch of product in 2011 cumulatively

changes mentioned above could have resulted in divergences in comparison to the data published in the previous report

as we are just starting to develop consolidated csr data collection at sberbank group some of the subsidiary banks and
affiliated companies have no systems for nonfinancial data collection or do not do such collection yet the area of coverage of
subsidiary banks and affiliated companies of the group by gri indicators is shown in table 28
