compressed natural gas cng series hybrid bus

the internal combustion engine is a highly nonlinear system which is efficient only in a small operating zone cng
offers lower co2 emissions per kwh and thus a cng series hybrid bus becomes the lowest co2 emitting urban bus
considering the energy mix in india we have developed this technology and have now commercialized the
technology with 10 buses sold to emt madrid the public transportation authority of the city of madrid spain in
2013 the buses have been in operation for more than 2 years and have covered close to a million km cumulative in
operation the vehicles have been giving 24  27 savings in fuel consumption in
general and have reported up to 40 fuel savings the customer is saving around
16300 kg of cng every year due to the tata motors hybrid bus fleet which
translates to about 45 tonnes of co2 emissions which could reach up to 200 tonnes
co2 in the long term cng series hybrid buses further reduces co2 emissions and
are arguably the lowest co2 emitting public transportation solution today for
buses in india

we are committed to maximizing customer satisfaction and strives to achieve the goal of excellence by continual
improvement through ongoing design and development of safe cost effective quality products by using
environmentally sustainable technologies in line with the corporate quality and environmental policies as the
global demand for energy increases exponentially the energy sources mainly fossil fuels are being seriously
depleted there is therefore critical need for finding means of conserving nonrenewable energy sources as well as
to identify nonpolluting renewable energy sources which will fuel our energy needs in our longterm future with
this in mind we have focused on development of fuel efficient vehicles and vehicles using alternate fuels

life cycle thinking at tata motors

with a view to design and develop sustainable automobile products we have taken up life cycle assessment lca
initiative at engineering research centre pune we have adopted lca approach in two ways fuel life cycle
analysis and product life cycle analysis energy use and emissions are a function of fuel production and vehicle
efficiencies and emissions fuel life cycle assessment consists of welltotank wtt analysis and tanktowheel
ttw analysis the wtt analysis covers the energy use and emissions generated during the fuel production stage
whereas the ttw stage concerns the energy use and emissions associated with vehicle operation over a typical
indian drive cycle this is the first fuel life cycle assessment study conducted in indian context providing inputs on
future sustainable fuels for automotive products

we are the 1st indian automobile company to conduct such lca studies and completed lca of a car  nano during
the fy 201415 we conducted lcas of four products viz nanocng safari storme acediesel and acecng
environmental impacts including carbon footprint of these products were assessed and compared

utilization of vacant rooftop space of buildings and shops in our existing manufacturing locations have for long
presented an opportunity to enhance onsite renewable power generation feasibility of rooftop solar pv projects
had been evaluated but could not be implemented due to various limitations now with the technology to
switchover plant electrical load to solar power during daytime and readiness of solar power companies to invest
capital for erection of rooftop pv panels we have created a model which benefits tata motors the solar power
company and the environment tml has entered into longterm power purchase agreements with service providers
in which we provide the idle roof space on available builtup area and the solar power company supplies the
generated solar power at a price lower than grid power the 1st solar pv plant of 223 kwp was commissioned at
pune which will eventually culminate into a total capacity of 1500 kwp capacity at pune we are in the process of
replicating this pune model across other manufacturing locations which will have a combined capacity of 5000 kwp

coprocessing of hazardous waste in cement industry

coprocessing is the use of high calorific value hazardous waste in cement industry as an alternative fuel or
material substitute coprocessing is being promoted by regulatory authorities as a sustainable alternative to
destruction through incineration and  or landfilling our manufacturing plants at sanand dharwad 
jamshedpur which have cement manufacturing plants in proximity explored the possibility and have commenced
disposal of suitable hazardous waste types for coprocessing after obtaining the necessary regulatory permissions
the benefits of coprocessing are  energy recovery from hazardous waste avoidance of corresponding quantity of
coal required as fuel for cement manufacturing and ghg emissions thereof and the safe disposal of hazardous
waste as the high kiln temperatures ensure complete destruction of hazardous components

car plant pune  effluent recycling through innovative
finance model

the rising cost of industrial raw water legal conditions
regarding zero discharge and the need to conserve
water  a precious natural resource provides
compelling reasons to recycle industrial effluent and
sewage back for reuse in manufacturing process
various technologies are available for tertiary
treatment of effluent of which reverse osmosis is
widely used high energy cost variability in feed
treated effluent characteristics high cost of
membranes skilled manpower for operation are some
challenges faced in adoption of this technology                      quality of recycled effluent which is blended with

at car plant pune we adopted a unique financial model
to overcome these challenges by opting for a build
own operate  transfer boot model with a well
known oem in which the service provider set up a
containerized ro plant which uses their patented plate
and tube type of membrane instead of conventional
spiral wound membrane cost of energy and utilities
are factored into the financial agreement as per which
the service provider charges tml per m3 of permeate
generated permeate is blended with raw water from
utility midc and reused in manufacturing process in

tata motors supplier base is several decades old and includes suppliers of nonproprietary parts such as sheet
metal components or subassemblies rubber and plastic components cast and machined parts with or without
surface treatment design changes fluctuating business and lack of robust systems often lead to quality issues
with material sourced from such suppliers

during the reporting year tata motors launched project sankalp  a supplier transformation initiative project
sankalp is intended to benefit those suppliers who have low rating in terms of quality productivity and
profitability cross functional teams which pools the expertise of several inhouse functions such as quality
manufacturing technical services production engineering and kaizen are nominated as a supplier improvement
team sit to closely engage and work with identified suppliers through capability building waste elimination re
work rejections transit damages etc resource conservation and improving work environment hygiene and
safety

project sankalp has received a good response from the targeted suppliers who have eliminated cost of rework
rejections and penalties with improvement in quality of supplied parts 25 suppliers were covered during the
reporting period and the initiative is being scaled up to cover the remaining suppliers across locations identified for
collaboration over the next two years

installation of handpump under amrutdhara project

kanti bala debi 38 years of village kokda potka block east singhbhum led a perilous life for having to cross a long
stretch of paddy land almost 300 meters to fetch water from river gurra there were a few hand pump in her
village but either they were defunct or the quality of water was not fit for consumption owing to high turbidity
and iron content the water from which was mostly used for washing clothes cleaning utensils and bathing
purposes on request by village gram sabha led to installation of a hand pump under smdfs amrutdhara project
keeping in view the problem of the quality of ground water this project was installed in the farm area and deep
boring and fortunately after testing the water sample it was found that the quality of water was drinkable and
safe today kanti debi and other
ladies of her village are saved from
the misery of travelling all the way to
fetch the river water which was
highly unsafe for drinking the same
was palpable with most villagers
suffering from skin and stomach
disorders before the installation of
the amrutdhara project kanti debi
still recalls the hard times particularly
during rainy season when she had to
walk through the puddle more so at
late evening when it was highly
unsafe and insecure to venture out of
her home to the distant river




project amrutdhara addressing the need of drinking water

ms chinta majhi of village rajdoha jamshedpur block east singhbhum was used to toiling hard every day for
fetching drinking water from a lone hand pump at an adjoining hamlet of her village which was 250 meters away
from her home ever since she came to her village after marriage it was her regular chore every morning and
evening along with covillage women
and girls which she had never
thought she will get relieved from
during summer her drudgery
increased in many folds when the
lone hand pump would not supply
enough water to meet every bodys
ends and she had to traverse almost
100 meters extra for accessing water
from a well belonging to a generous
villager with hand pump installed
through the amrutdhara project
she sighs with un describable relief as
her discomfiture reduced immensely
as she has access to potable safe
drinking water almost at her
doorstep she now spends quality
time tending her 3 years old small girl
child kunti also now she and the co
villagers are assured of safe drinking
water

tml is in the process of establishing systems to capture the informationdata for some performance indicators which are
partially reported in the report we have evaluated the reports adherence to the following principles on a scale of good
acceptable and needs improvement

stakeholder inclusiveness as a part of its stakeholder engagement process the company has engaged with nine key
stakeholder internal and external groups for assessing the emerging risks at its indian operational sites based on the
selected reporting boundary the material issues emerging from the stakeholder engagement were collected and
prioritized and the results are fairly reflected in the report however the company needs to bring out key risks and
opportunities in the value chain the report may explicitly bring out outcomes of stakeholder engagement and tml
response to identified material issues in our opinion the level at which the report adheres to this principle is acceptable

materiality the materiality determination process was validated based on inputs from key stakeholders including
employees fleet customers suppliers institutional investors road safety experts government authorities media local
communities and senior management of tml and this report has not missed out any known material issues in our opinion
the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good

responsiveness the report focusses its disclosures on key material aspects at the macro level the company has fairly
responded to identified key sustainability aspect topics and challenges in the local sustainability context including aspects
related to the automobile sector within the reporting boundary in our view the level at which the report adheres to this
principle is acceptable

reliability the majority of data and information verified at the corporate office and five operational sites were found to be
accurate some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to
transcription interpretation and aggregation errors and the errors have been communicated for correction in our view the
level at which the report adheres to this principle is good

completeness the report has fairly reported the general and specific standard disclosures including the management
approach monitoring systems and sustainability performances indicators against gri g4 requirements corresponding to
the in accordance  core option for the reporting requirements however the company needs to further disclose the
sustainability strategies management approach related to significant impact of its value chain in our view the level at
which the report adheres to this principle is acceptable

neutrality the disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are reported in a neutral tone in terms of
content and presentation in our view the level at which the report adheres to this principle is good

 opportunities for improvement

 the following are an excerpt from the observations and opportunities for improvement reported to the management of the
 company and are not considered for drawing our conclusions on the report however they are generally consistent with the
 managements objectives
    to further strengthen the disclosure of the sustainability impacts of material aspects and strategic responses to material
     issues and stakeholder expectations
    the disclosure on management approach could consider disclosure on specific aspects to further explain the
     management approach with respect to material aspects
    future reports may expand aspect boundary to include all subsidiaries joint ventures and supply chain partners and
     disclose the sustainability performance
