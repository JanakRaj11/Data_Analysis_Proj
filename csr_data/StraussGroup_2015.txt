       notes
           it is important to note that categorizing many thousands of employees in different roles and a positions in to three groups  nonmanagers middle managers and senior
            managers  generates broad groups of very heterogeneous populations that include many diverse roles that are different in levels of responsibility seniority and complexity within
            each group strauss groups remuneration approach is based on among other things a comparison of market salary levels for similar roles without reference to gender the
            average salary calculated by group does not correctly reflect current salary levels for similar roles at each organizational level therefore this analysis of comparative salary levels
            for men and women on the basis of average salaries per group is not representative of our organizational reality and highlights gaps in salary levels due to significant differences in
            the nature and level of diverse roles and the levels of salaries determined by market norms and not because of different womenmen salary levels on a role by role basis
            salary data is not available for comparison in all locations where data was not comparable at management or nonmanagement level this has been excluded
           rest of world includes brazil australia and mexico in 2014 as we expanded the scope of our reporting to include these new sabraobela operations in 2012 and 2013 this
            refers to brazil only
           data excludes max brenner operations for all years due to some inconsistencies which are under review 2012 figures are restated accordingly
            data excludes nonmanagement figures for sabra operations in the us due to some inconsistencies which are under review
            data for nonmanagers in israel is restated for 2013 due to a calculation error in the prior report
           at senior management level due to small overall management numbers small changes can make a big difference in the salary ratios in the us at senior management level
            for example a change in the composition of the fivestrong management team caused a shift from women at 64 of men salaries in 2013 to 107 in 2014
