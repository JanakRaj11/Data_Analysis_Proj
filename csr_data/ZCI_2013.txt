chairmans report

i am pleased to provide to all stakeholders of the group my first report as acting chairman of the board of directors
of zci limited

the period covered by this report has been a diffxowrqhiruwkhmxqlruplqlqjlqgxvwudqgirulwkdvdjdlqehhq
a period of challenges and change as in the prior years chairmans report i have sought to include information to
allow our stakeholders to get a clear picture of where we are what we stand for and where we would like to be as a
company the elements were  and remain  effective running of the board corporate governance and compliance
achievements risk and risk management and our future outlook i would like to take this opportunity to report on our
progress with each of these elements

effective running of the board

one of the key responsibilities of the chairman of the board is to ensure that the board takes full responsibility for the
important issues facing the group that the board has the right mix of skills and experience to meet the challenges that
it faces and that the board understands the risks and challenges that its strategies must take into account

the appointment of tom kamwendo as ceo during the 2012 financial year has greatly helped to ensure that the board
is well placed to meet all of our objectives as a result mr kamwendo has been reappointed as ceo on 21 march
2013 for a further year the board appreciates his unrelenting commitment to the company and i would like to express
my gratitude for the renewed strategic focus he has brought to the group and the outstanding leadership he has
provided during the past financial year as the ceo of zci limited

the board met regularly during the year to ensure that it was capable of fulfilling its charter and dealing with the many
strategic and risk management issues that have arisen during this period of change continuing work has been put into
ensuring the company is adequately addressing risk and considering issues of strategic importance

the board welcomes feedback from cdf as its major shareholder and considers the interests of all stakeholders in
formulating its policies and strategies

corporate governance and compliance

the board is aware of the need to comply with the jse listing requirements and remains committed to best practice
corporate governance principles appropriate for the size type and activity of zci during the year further progress in
the area of governance and compliance was made and the benefits of the increased implementation of king iii
principles made during the last reporting period has come to the fore in line with the strategic objectives of zci the
board will continue to ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements and improved corporate governance

risks and risk management

in line with king iii requirements we have sought to provide our stakeholders with an increased amount of information
on how risks are managed within the group

zcis investment in the mining operations of african copper plc acu has many risks many of which are common
to all mining enterprises as the drive toward sustainable commercial production levels continues our risk
management focus has been on ensuring risks at an operational level are considered and action plans to combat them
are implemented while zci can exercise little control over world commodity prices and foreign exchange rates we
are confident that the risk management and internal controls in place at zci are addressing the key issues under our
control

during the prior year the company reported that we had initiated a process intended to unlock value from its
investment in acu in march 2013 the board elected to suspend this process in light of the effect of adverse global
market conditions on junior mining companies and the general increased risk aversion among investors

                                                                                                                        18

zci limited
integrated annual report for the year ended 31 march 2013
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

the company received a number of proposals which the board believed did not reflect the intrinsic value of its
investment in acu and accordingly chose not to proceed with any of those proposals the board is continuing to work
towards realising the full value of its investment in acu

global copper market

the major investment of zci is in the copper mining operations of the group the global copper market is therefore a
key factor in the outlook of the group as the demand for copper and the copper price are key to the revenues of the
group

commodity markets have been negatively impacted by the uncertainties and risks relating to the growth of the
european chinese and american economies growth in global copper consumption continues to be closely linked to
demand from china  the worlds largest copper consumer  and the use of copper as an industrial metal in such
applications as buildings electronics appliances and automobiles means that demand is sensitive to fluctuations in the
global economy nevertheless we continue to believe that the copper market has strong underlying fundamentals
which should support demand for copper through the current period of global instability in world markets

early 2012 saw a strong rise in the price of copper which remained at these relatively high levels well into 2013
market consensus is that estimated global stocks of copper are still below those of other base metals while visible
terminal market stocks are also reasonably low many analysts have therefore in the light of the relatively low levels of
readily available stocks the continued mine disruptions and supply under performance taken a bullish viewpoint for
the copper price continuing into the next year a strong copper price for the coming period will have positive
implications for the profitability of the groups operations

botswana

the mining operations of the group are undertaken in north eastern botswana the economic and political stability
both of botswana and its neighbouring countries are deeply relevant to the outlook of the group

botswana continues to be a politically stable environment for the groups mining activities when compared to other
countries in the region and botswana consistently outperforms many of its peers in mining policy surveys and
governance performance assessments

the botswana government has continued to emphasise its interest in promoting the nondiamond mining sector and is
reported to be working on further incentives for this sector this bodes well for the groups principal investments in
botswana

the botswana labour regime can be regarded as friendly with limited labour stoppages increased investment in
botswana by competitors has increased the demand for skilled labour incentive schemes and training plans are in
place within the group to help reduce the impact of skilled labour being attracted to the mining operations of
competitors

mining operations

over the past years zci has undertaken significant investment in the thakadu and mowana mining operations with a
view to obtaining selfsustaining levels of production and we continue to believe that our properties provide
tremendous opportunities for growth it is with great pleasure that i can report that this has been an overall strong year
and despite the short term difficulties experienced in the early part of the current financial year clear progress toward
realising the full potential of the assets has been made




                                                                                                                        19

acu generated improvements in all of its key operating measures production levels and recovery rates increased and
we expect the generally more stable operating conditions to continue through the coming year the board and i remain
excited and confident in the future of our mining operations and we expect to realise the benefits of our capital
expenditure programme through the remainder of the year with continuing operating stability and consistent throughput
and production levels

sustainable development

at the mowana and thakadu mines management has focussed on promoting and ensuring that a strong safety culture is
developed and maintained the group again similar to the prior reporting period achieved a fatality free year we are
very proud of this achievement

as a company zci takes the environmental impact of mining activities and the mitigation thereof seriously
particularly prevention of contamination of a relatively scarce water supply and avoidance of damage of archaeological
sites during the year further strides have been taken to remediate historical impact increase corporate social
involvement and to implement preventative measures for future impacts key of which was successful workshops with
community leaders from the five villages in the surrounding area during the latter half of 2012 ensuring that we obtain
direct input from the community with regards to their needs and expectations surrounding the environment and social
responsibility and enabling us to respond accordingly

outlook

a key driver in the companys future direction is the need to create value for shareholders the group will also
continue to strive to create value for its employees and the communities in which the group operates sustainable
growth is a key component of any future strategic direction of zci

the board is continuing to work towards realising the full value of its investment in acu and will pursue all relevant
opportunities to unlock value and put the group in a position to build a more diversified investment portfolio providing
sustainable growth for its shareholders

the reappointment of the ceo will continue to provide a strong focus for moving forward with the companys
strategies and helps ensure that the interest and concerns of zci are well represented throughout the group structure
we will shortly under the leadership and guidance from our ceo commence to undertake an endtoend review of the
groups strategy and look forward to sharing the updated strategic direction with our stakeholders in the coming
months

finally i would like to thank my fellow board members for their dedication and contribution throughout the year as
well as the reliable and appreciated work done by our major service providers

chief executive officers report

introduction

i am pleased to present to all zci stakeholders the integrated annual report for the year ended 31 march 2013 this
integrated report details the activities of the company during the previous period including details of financial and
sustainability performance as well as detailing the many challenges issues and opportunities for the company

operations

zci has continued its ongoing financial support of the groups mining activities the short to medium term goal of
this investment is to provide a platform on which mining operations can reach commercial production levels and
become cash flow positive and selfsupporting management has made significant progress towards achieving this
objective which is evident from the positive trend in copper produced

one of the key drivers behind my role as ceo remains enabling zci to have a greater presence and influence over the
mining operations to ensure that full value is being achieved for our stakeholders i continue to work closely with our
management team to help ensure they have the resources available and that production targets can be achieved i am
glad to report that we made clear progress toward realising the full potential of our assets and we generated
improvements in all of our key operating measures

african copper plc acu continued to register improvements in its performance over the financial year and generated
an operating profit from its mining operations while significantly reducing its overall net loss the improvement was
as a result of a significant increase in the production of tonnes of copper in concentrate mainly due to improved
recovery rates achieved this improvement was achieved despite a background of poor performance by acus mining
contractors a new drilling contractor as well as a new load and haul contractor both engaged in the last quarter of the
current financial year are expected to perform better than their predecessors which should result in further improved
production optimal contractor performance is a key focus area for management in the coming period

exploration

the groups continued exploration at matsitama during the financial year focussed on the nakalakwana area an
intensive review of all the geological data and a subsequent drilling programme showed very promising results with
rock types and alteration intersected consistent with that seen in other ironoxidecoppergold iocg type deposits

we anticipate further encouraging progress from our exploration project at matsitama during the periods ahead

safety environmental issues and communities

the group again achieved a fatality free year the lost time injury frequency rate ltifr measured as a ratio of lost
time injuries per 200000 man hours worked increased from 031 in the previous year to 070 in the current year which
despite being higher than the previous year is lower than historical average while we are satisfied with our
performance in this area we will be working to improve this further

we have made significant progress in our development of environmental management standards and operating
procedures key aspects of these standards and procedures are waste management water management dust
management progressive rehabilitation wildlife management and the related environmental performance reporting to
the botswana chamber of mines among other things we deployed more than 10000m³ of waste water for use in
access road rehabilitation saving both potable water and diesel fuel and are currently investigating the potential to use
waste water for agricultural purposes we also carried out procedures to improve sewage management and are
investigating means of suppressing dust production from different aspects of our operations including the main
mowana access road



                                                                                                                         21

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

we are seeing benefits from the more structured approach in developing our corporate social investment programme
and with the inputs obtained from the five villages in the surrounding area by means of a community workshop with
the community leaders during the latter part of 2012 we now have a much greater understanding on their key needs
and are much better placed to address these needs in a focused manner we remain very positive about the interaction
with the community and will continue to strive to be aware of and where possible meet their demands within the
framework of environmentally sustainable operations

strategy

a common theme in both the 2011 annual report and the 2012 integrated annual report was that zci is undertaking
a period of transition in which the company would seek to realign its investment portfolio with its strategic objectives
this period is still continuing and the overall strategy for zci remains largely unchanged

the engagement of rand merchant bank corporate finance rmb to realise value from the investment of zci in
acu was an important first step in that direction zci received a number of proposals in this process but the nature of
these proposals were such that its board did not believe them to reflect the intrinsic value of acu and accordingly
chose not to proceed with any of those proposals consequently and as a result of globally challenging market
conditions and specifically that of the junior mining section coupled with a marked increase in risk aversion among
investors zci elected to terminate the engagement with rmb zcis board is continuing to work towards realising the
full value of its investment in african copper and we are considering a number of ways in which this can be achieved
with this in mind the board has begun to reassess the companys strategy and determine key initiatives activities and
processes to achieve these goals

achieving production levels at which the operations of acu can be financially selfsufficient remains an important
goal for zci and considerable investments have been made by zci in the past to achieve this with this objective in
mind we continued to undertake and complete key capex projects during the year these were all instrumental in
achieving the results for the past financial year furthermore in preparation for the likely depletion of the thakadu ore
during the next twelve months drilling has commenced at the mowana pit to ensure that there will be ore available
from mowana by april 2014 further detailed information can be found in the operational review section of this
report

risks

risk management is a key component of the decision making process within zci many of the risks faced by zci are
common to all companies involved in mining operations and some of the risks are particular to the nature of zcis
structure operations and investment portfolio

zci has defined material issues or risks as topics and indicators that reflect the organisations significant economic
environmental and social impacts or that would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of
stakeholders this enabled the board to identify material issues and risks faced by the group as well as corresponding
strategies

a lack of diversity in the investment portfolio of zci and the risks that this can present remains one of the key risks
faced by zci zci currently has one major investment being debt and equity held in acu considerable investment
has been made by zci into achieving production levels at which the operations can be financially selfsufficient
although there has been a significant improvement in the production levels in the year under review this still
represents a significant financial risk for zci and the group overcoming the issues preventing the achievement of our
production targets remains the key focus of management and all employees throughout the group

the rmb process to realise value from the investment in acu was intended to help alleviate some of the immediate
risks being faced by zci and the group but as mentioned previously the desired results were not obtained by this
process whilst the board of zci is continuing its efforts to realise the full value of its investment in acu the group
mining operations will require further investment to support the development of the resource to its maximum level

                                                                                                                        22

from a group mining perspective the risk of running a single line plant continues to be the companys main
operational risk this is being mitigated by the acquisition of critical spare parts which are expected to be delivered
within the first half of the new financial year

only upon achievement of consistent cash flow positive production levels will the value from the investment and
potential benefits to all stakeholders be obtained the board remains confident that these production levels can be
achieved and the mining operations continue to have our full support

conclusion

while we remain cautious on commodity price forecasts and still face a number of challenges within the group mining
operations we are encouraged by the positive trends seen in production and are optimistic that the more stable
operating conditions will continue allowing continuing improvement towards achieving our goals the new financial
year has commenced with record monthly production of tonnes of copper in concentrate which bodes well for the next
financial year

i would like to take this opportunity to extend my appreciation on behalf of the company to the hard working and
dedicated management and operations staff at the mowana and thakadu operations and at the matsitama project that
has enabled us to deliver good results i would also like to acknowledge the efforts of the finance director and our
administration team at maitland finally special thanks go to the chairman and all of the directors of zci for their
support and guidance

operational review  mining and exploration activities

mowana mine and process plant

during the period under review we continued our progress towards achieving stable operations at the mowana mine in
northeast botswana and have been active in implementing the capital expenditure programmes necessary to support
this goal for the year ended 31 march 2013 we produced copper in concentrate of 9496 tonnes 37 higher than the
corresponding period last year and we achieved record production levels in march 2013 of 1314 tonnes of copper in
concentrate

this increased production was due to the following factors

  x     greater plant throughput as the plant became more stable  we processed 801901 tonnes of ore in 2013
        compared to 738921 tonnes in 2012  a 9 increase

  x     all the ore processed during the current financial year came from the thakadu pit with an average grade of
        178 in 2012 the average grade was 193 with 73 of the ore coming from the thakadu pit and the balance
        from the mowana pit

  x     recovery rates increased to 665 from 48 for the year as whole with the latter months of the financial year
        recording substantially higher recoveries during december 2012 we recorded our highest recovery rate to date
        at 956 this reflects the decline in the relative percentage of oxide ore processed through our plant and the
        increase in that of higherrecovery sulphide ore from the thakadu openpit

we experienced some production issues subsequent to the end of the year necessitating production delays for
approximately 15 days in april 2013 we have ordered new mill gear critical spares which we expect to be available
for installation in august 2013 on the whole however we expect recovery rates to remain higher than 80 throughout
the current year due to treatment of thakadu sulphides this shift will also correspondingly reduce our reliance on
chemical reagents which was a significant expense during the period

the following table summarizes the mines performance during 2013 compared to 2012

                                                                       jan to       jan to

1 12 months ended 31 march 2013
2 12 months ended 31 march 2012


our operating costs per tonne remained above budgeted levels maintenance costs caused by major component
inefficiencies and design upgrades throughout the plant were higher than we originally anticipated on average the
plant processed about 66825 tonnes per month during the year compared to 61577 tonnes in 2012 lower than its
design capacity of 90000 to 100000 tonnes per month while we have now addressed many of the past production
bottlenecks a change to a new mining contractor in january  february 2013 at thakadu contributed to ore delivery
delays thereby increasing productionrelated costs




                                                                                                                      24

during the year we spent approximately us66 million on capital expenditure upgrades at the plant and capitalised
deferred stripping costs at thakadu the major areas of expenditures at the plant including expenditures on future
projects were as follows

x   primary crusher to increase throughput and plant availability  fabrication is complete and installation is planned
    at the beginning of july 2013
x   upgrades to conveyors and pumps  these are ongoing and will help sustain stable plant operations
x   automated bagging of concentrates to reduce cost  this is at design stage
x   treatment of tailings to recover copper locked in copper  this is at testwork stage

as previously reported in order to accelerate to higher grade thakadu sulphides mining activities at the mowana
openpit were stopped during the prior year and the mowana mining fleet moved to thakadu this was in line with our
processing strategy as described below to maximise copper units through the plant by focusing production on higher
grade ore we plan to recommence full mining activities at the mowana pit in october 2013 although a small fleet has
been mobilised in june 2013 to prepare for full operations our mining schedule has been designed to provide
sufficient time to perform the required waste stripping necessary to expose supergene ore for processing after the
reserves at thakadu are depleted which we expect to be in mid2014 at mowana oxide ores provide recoveries of
approximately 60 whereas supergene ore recoveries are approximately 80 we therefore plan to stockpile the oxide
ore encountered at higher levels of the mine and process to supergene ore as a priority

thakadu openpit

thakadu is the groups high grade coppersilver deposit lying about 70km from the mowana processing infrastructure
thakadus ore is transported by road to the mowana mine processing facility and shares the mowana mine
infrastructure and management

during the year under review mining operations reached below 60 metres depth in the thakadu open pit with a
corresponding increase in the proportion of sulphide ore mined and processed with the exception of april 2013 ore
supplied to the plant since december 2012 has been primarily sulphides generating monthly recoveries in excess of
85 in december 2012 we established a record monthly recovery rate of 956 in may 2013 we produced 1408 mt
of copper in concentrate our highest ever production benefiting from both higher throughput and a recovery in excess
of 89

from a mining perspective operations at thakadu performed below budget due to a change in mining contractor and to
persistent equipment and efficiency problems with the drilling contractor in addition during the year we identified
certain localized instability on the north eastern highwall of the thakadu pit to address this instability the mine plan
was redesigned including the development of a new ramping system on the hanging wall side south west as part of
this redesign haul road widths were also increased from 15m to 20m to accommodate larger capacity trucks the
impact of the budget shortfalls and redesign of the pit has caused the forecast strip ratio for the thakadu pit to increase
from 64 to 87 until it is depleted during 2014

the change in mining and drilling contractors in february and march 2013 generated immediate production increases
we believe this enhanced performance will continue putting us in a good position to achieve the objectives set out in
the thakadu mine plan

environmental activity

we place great emphasis on our responsibility to the environment and communities surrounding our properties in
botswana and we submitted quarterly reports to the botswana chamber of mines on our performance in this regard
during the year among other things we deployed more than 10000m³ of waste water for use in access road
rehabilitation saving both potable water and diesel fuel and are currently investigating the potential to use waste water
for agricultural purposes we also carried out procedures to improve sewage management and are investigating means
of suppressing dust production from different aspects of our operations including the main mowana access road
                                                                                                                          25

exploration

during the current financial year we focused our exploration activities primarily in the nakalakwana area within
prospecting licence pl 172004

we carried out an intensive review of all the geological data in the nakalakwana area resulting in an eight hole
diamond drilling programme targeting iron oxide copper and gold iocg mineralization drilling results to date have
been very promising with rock types and alteration intersected as seen in other iocg type deposits the average
footprint of an iocg deposit worldwide is 10 hectares 500 x 200 metres given that the area being explored is greater
than 30km2 we are currently assessing modern geophysical techniques to identify areas of high prospects before
further drilling would be undertaken

exploration expenditure totalled us22 million for the financial year

we continue to enjoy a very productive relationship with the botswana government in the normal course we have
exploration and prospecting licences which come up for renewal from time to time as at the date of this integrated
report we have a prospecting license and an exploration licence to the north of our mining licence area which has
expired but for which we have filed applications with the government of botswana for renewal in addition we have a
prospecting licence that falls due for renewal at 31 december 2013 and five more that fall due for renewal in 2014 we
currently intend to seek renewal of all our existing licences since the work done to date has confirmed our interest in
and potential of the underlying properties we believe the likelihood of their renewal is supported by our strong
relationship with the government of botswana and the past work and expenditures we have incurred however no
assurance exists that any new licences will be granted on a timely basis nor that all or any of our existing licences will
be renewed for the same areas or with the same terms and conditions that currently apply as at 31 march 2013 license
numbers pl332005 and pl802008 situated within the mowana tenements are post expiry date applications for
renewal have been submitted but as at the date of this integrated report confirmation of renewal remain outstanding
as a result we have impaired exploration expenditure relating to these licences as described in note 12 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 march 2013 which forms part of this integrated report

with the preparation of a circular to ordinary shareholders of zci dated 17 december 2009 and appeared in a
competent persons report of rsv dated october 2009 the cpr

in preparing the cpr rsv reviewed the companys existing mineral resource and mineral reserve models for the
mowana pit which were calculated on assumptions determined to be appropriate by african copper including a
010 cu cutoff grade and which have previously been disclosed by african copper in an announcement dated
26 november 2007 rsv applied its own set of assumptions including a higher cutoff grade of 025 cu and re
estimated certain values these reserves were reestimated allowing for depletions due to mining between the period
august 2009 and 31 march 2012 no mining depletions have occurred at the mowana pit during the period under

rounding of figures may result in minor computational discrepancies

the inferred material has been included at the bottom of the mowana mineral reserve statement because it is
incidental to the mine plan mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic
viability

no mining activities have taken place at the mowana pit since march 2012 at this time mining equipment was
transferred to thakadu pit to facilitate access and mining of the higher grade sulphide ore available at this operation
mining activities are currently expected to resume at mowana during october 2013

thakadu pit

the table below sets out the most recent estimates of probable mineral reserves at the thakadu pit in preparing the
original estimates which appeared in the rsv cpr rsv reviewed the companys existing mineral resource models
for the thakadu pit which were calculated based on assumptions determined to be appropriate by african copper
including a 05 cu cutoff grade utilizing ordinary kriging and which had previously been disclosed by the
company in its announcement dated 25 july 2007

in converting the resources to probable mineral reserves rsv applied its own set of assumptions including a higher
cutoff grade of 05 cu to evaluate an economic pitshell based on african coppers existing proposed pit design
these reserves have been reestimated allowing for mining depletions between the period august 2009 and 31 march

matsitama minerals

matsitama minerals holds title to six prospecting licenses pls in eastcentral botswana 60km to 90km west of
francistown the pls are contiguous with the mowana pit to the north and the thakadu pit to the south and cover
much of the highly prospective matsitama schist belt msb totalling 20848km2 in extent

exploration activities continued in the msb the exploration team did further work on the iocg prospective
nakalakwana area in pl172004 and the matsitama west area in pl162004 it also did extensive work around the
thakadu pit within pl012005 and ml201096l as near mine exploration see figure 2

following the extension of pl012005 for another 2 years ending june 2014 trenching activities and rc drilling of
high copper anomalies was done to establish the presence of ore grade mineralization around the thakadu pit five
diamond drill holes have also recently been completed in the vicinity of the thakadu pit  see figure 3  results of this
exploration effort indicate that copper mineralization within the immediate area of the pit is much lower grade the
copper mineralization seen is sub economic due to the poor development of the quartz carbonate unit which hosts the
high grade mineralization within the thakadu pit

exploration in the msb continues to be focused on ironoxidecoppergold iocg mineralization these deposits
can be very large capable of supporting mining operations for periods of 30 or more years it has long been believed
that the msb may host iocg mineralization but until recently no conclusive proof had been found to confirm the
existence of this type of deposit in the belt agedating from the previous reporting year have revealed younger granite
intrusions and therefore the affinity with iocgtype deposits

the initial funding in july 2010 of usd25 million resulted in drilled targets across the msb which tested various
priority targets and which later formed the basis for further work figure 5 as a result of this drilling work was done
in the matsitama west area for iocg related mineralization but resulted in poor copper intersections and the target
being abandoned work was also done on nakalakwana hill protore deposit with an additional 31 drill holes to
increase confidence and upgrade the inferred resource determined earlier by srk consultants follow up work was
done in the nakalakwana tower area located immediately east of nakalakwana hill after drilling a few holes to test
geophysical targets that were determined by induced polarisation ip survey

the matsitama west iocg target was trenched and geologically mapped in detail the review of the data collected in
the area show that the conductive body is graphite no significant mineralization that warrants further work in the area
was identified and work was abandoned a final geological report has been compiled for this area

in september 2012 the geological data in the nakalakwana area was reviewed and a new drilling programme of
3000m was started in october 2012 to test eight proposed drill targets based on geology geophysics soil
geochemistry and rock alteration figure 4 a total of 1976m has been drilled so far with six holes completed on the
programme results of the drilling continue to be encouraging with some copper mineralization intersected and has led
to a better understanding of the area which will help to determine further follow up work

the lephaseiocg target still remains a priority target in msb and will only be committed for further work depending
on final results from the nakalakwana area figure 5

in addition the company continues to consider evaluation of banded iron formation bif exposures in the gamogae
prospects for both iron and gold the bif can be traced over a distance of 13km samples were submitted for
metallurgical test work the samples were found to contain more hematite than magnetite due to surface effects it is
anticipated that an increase in magnetite which is more amenable to treatment for iron ore extraction may be
experienced at depth drilling of the target was attempted but was not carried out due to other priorities at the time
assay values for deleterious elements were also very low

the nakalakwana target also hosts a pretectonic copperrich protore of possible basaltic affinity non codecompliant
mineral resources for the protore have previously been estimated by the msa group and subsequently audited by
srk codecompliant inferred mineral resources have now been estimated for nakalakwana hill the mineral
resource estimate was completed in order to guide infill drilling at nakalakwana which should enable increase in
confidence and a move from inferred resources to indicated resources the infill drilling programme of 6440m was
completed and assays obtained for further resource estimation resource estimation is currently being undertaken by
srk with the aim of assessing the oxide downdip and downplunge potential

sustainability and environmental management

introduction

presented herein is the summary of activities undertaken by the environmental section towards ensuring
environmentally sustainable operations during financial year ended 31 march 2013 information presented is applicable
for mowana mine including the mowana pit and thakadu pit operations as well as mosetse housing estate as an
ancillary operational component as this is the first year that we are presenting an environmental managent report as
part of our integrated report comparative figures for the 2012 financial year are not available

development of environmental management standards and operating
procedures

the operational procedures listed below were developed to guide various aspects of environmental management during
the 2013 reporting period they are expected to be finalized and implemented during the 2014 financial year

  x    waste management strategy
  x    procedure for the management oil oils and greases
  x    procedure for the disposal of fluorescent tubes
  x    procedure for the management of clinical waste
  x    procedure for the treatment of contaminated soils
  x    radiation protection programme

waste management

domestic waste management

due to unavailability of onsite landfills domestic waste continued to be transferred to a local dumping site during the
reporting period approximately 115m3 of solid waste were removed from the mowana mine including mowana and
thakadu pits and approximately us 66900 was spent in the transfer of this waste the quoted figure is inclusive of
expenditure on the rental and service of mobile toilets

scrap metal removal

the arrangement with alman metals pty ltd collecting scrap from the mowana mine operations continued into 2013
approximately three hundred and thirty eight tonnes of scrap raised us36900 of revenue for the group the scrap
sold consisted of conveyor belts general scrap metal and metal drums

accumulation of recyclables

one hundred and eleven ink cartridges were accumulated during the reporting period but were not sent for recycling
the plan is to accumulate more and send off for recycling during the new financial year

clinical waste management

six kilograms of expired drugs were disposed through incineration process at masunga landfill the drugs were
accumulated from 2008 at mowana clinic




                                                                                                                        33

as part of fulfilling the obligation to the memorandum of understanding mou entered into between acu and
mosetse brigade monitoring activities were carried out on mosetse brigade sewage ponds over the reporting period
the outcome of the exercise was positive and has helped to give assurance in the alternative usage of the waste water

waste management facilities

work towards the restoration of mowana salvage yard continued the specific achievements attained included the
following

         x   continued separation of waste to allow for sale of scrap and or safe disposal
         x   design of the salvage yard site as the basis for the development of the site and eventual registration and
             licensing with the department of waste management  pollution control dwmpc

water management

waste water usage

as part of the ongoing efforts to reduce usage of potable water sources waste water generated from mosetse housing
estate mhe and disposed at mosetse brigade was identified as a good source for use during the rehabilitation of the
mosetselepashe access road once permissions were obtained from management of mosetse brigade more than
10 000m3 was obtained for usage on the road this initiative helped to save potable water and diesel fuel

the potential to use waste for agriculture is currently being investigated if feasible the initiative will go a long way to
contributing to zcis social corporate investment initiatives

rainwater harvesting

a concept project geared towards harvesting rain water from roof tops of 50 houses at mosetse housing estate was
drafted the project aims at installation of water tanks in every household to harvest rain water during the rainy season

pit dewatering and tailings dam return water

water from mowana pit and the tailings dam continued to be used to augment the allowed 2640m3day abstraction
from the dukwe wellfields the water recycled in this way plays an important role in minimizing reliance on
groundwater from the wellfields




                                                                                                                             35

dust management

dust suppression on haulage roads

the environmental section facilitated an overview and trial of some more sustainable dust suppression products
dust wrap and calcium chloride as mitigation measures that can be applied in different sections of operations where
dust is a problem including the main access road to mowana mine site visits to other operations where calcium
chloride is used were undertaken as part of the overview a decision on the method to be used should be taken at the
start of the new financial year

dust analysis

at the end of the 2013 reporting period the fallout dust monitoring units sourced in 2011 were not operational due to
delays incurred in arranging for external laboratory analysis of the captured dust the arrangements were finalized in
april 2013 the first batches of the sampling results were being processed at the time of preparing this report

progressive rehabilitation

arrangements for progressive rehabilitation were made in the form of stockpiling top soil stripped at thakadu pit
where operations are currently focused about 120 tonnes were stockpiled during the reporting period once the
targeted height of the waste rock dumps is attained the top soil will be used for capping before revegetation activities
commence

wildlife management

in order to address the problems caused by elephants that usually enter the mowana mine area between the months of
june to november a specialist was brought to site during the reporting period to advise on possible solutions the
application of pepper has been selected as a deterrent method to be piloted during 2014 financial year

training for snake handling occurred in the reporting year targeting more than fifteen employees

environmental performance reporting

quarterly reports were submitted to botswana chamber of mines during the reporting period

conclusion

management takes the environmental impact of mining activities and the mitigation thereof seriously we are
committed to the continuous improvement in this area and in providing transparent reporting the actions discussed
above are ongoing and further actions and initiatives will be considered during the coming financial year




                                                                                                                        36

directors are categorised as executive or nonexecutive in accordance with section 384 f of the jse listing
requirements during the year the board assessed the independence of the independent directors and was satisfied
that they retained their independence the independent directors of zci meet the definition of independence under
king iii the role of ceo is separated from the role of the chairman by a clearly stated division of responsibilities
in accordance with principle 217 of king iii

the nonexecutive directors provide advice to the board that is independent of management or service providers
they also provide an additional layer of control through checks and balances nonexecutive directors are entitled
to seek independent professional advice where deemed appropriate the presence of the independent directors on
the various committees helps to ensure that management and executives do not have unrestricted powers of
decision making

certain of the directors of zci are also directors of acu zci recognises that those directors have fiduciary duties
to the subsidiary and must act in its interests at all times

in line with king iii recommended practice 2163 and section 384 c of the jse listing requirements the
board designated professor stephen simukanga as the lead independent director to assist the board in the event
that any conflict of interest arises or when the chairmans performance is being evaluated the board is confident
that professor simukanga is eminently qualified and capable of fulfilling this role and is considered to be a suitable
person for the position

3 significant accounting policies

the principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out
below the policies have been applied consistently by the group companies

a basis of consolidation

i subsidiaries

subsidiaries are entities controlled by the group control is achieved were the company has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities the financial statements
of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the day that control commences until the
day that control ceases in assessing control the group takes into account potential voting rights that currently are
exercisable the accounting policies of the subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the
policies adopted by the group losses applicable to the noncontrolling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the
noncontrolling interests even if doing so causes the noncontrolling interests to have a deficit balance

ii transactions eliminated on consolidation

intragroup transactions balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated
unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent that there is no
evidence of impairment

iii business combinations

the acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer judgement is applied in determining
the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another
consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred liabilities incurred by the group to the
previous owners of the acquiree and equity instruments issued by the group consideration transferred also
includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and sharebased payment awards of the acquiree that are
replaced mandatorily in the business combination if the contingent consideration is classified as equity it is not
remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity otherwise subsequent changes to the fair value of the
contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss
a contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a
present obligation and arises from a past event and its fair value can be measured reliably the group measures
any noncontrolling interest at its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree transaction
costs that the group incurs in connection with a business combination such as finders fees legal fees due
diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees are expensed as incurred

for each business combination the group elects to measure any noncontrolling interest in the acquire either
  x at fair value or
  x at their proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets which are generally at fair value

acquisitions between 1 january 2004 and 1 january 2010
for acquisitions between 1 january 2004 and 1 january 2010 goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the
acquisition over the groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets
liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree when the excess was negative a bargain purchase gain was
recognised immediately in profit or loss transaction costs other than those associated with the issue of debt or
equity securities that the group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the
cost of the acquisition




                                                                                                                           60

3 significant accounting policies  continued

iv accounting for acquisitions of noncontrolling interests

acquisitions of noncontrolling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as
equity holders and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions
adjustments to noncontrolling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of control are based
on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary

b foreign currency translation

i foreign currency transactions
transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of group entities at
exchange rates at the dates of the transactions

monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the
functional currency at the exchange rate at that date the foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the
difference between amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year adjusted for effective
interest and payments during the period and the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate
at the end of the year

nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are
retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined

nonmonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction

foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss

ii foreign operations

the assets and liabilities of foreign operations with functional currencies different to that of the company
including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated to us at exchange rates at the
reporting date the income and expenses of foreign operations excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary
economies are translated to us at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions

foreign currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the foreign
currency translation reserve fctr in equity when a foreign operation is disposed of in part or in full the
relevant amount in the fctr is reattributed to noncontrolling interest

when the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor
likely in the foreseeable future foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered
to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income and are
presented within equity in the fctr

c financial instruments

i nonderivative financial assets

the group initially recognises loans and receivables and deposits on the date that they are originated all other
financial assets are recognised initially on the trade date at which the group becomes a party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument the group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows
from the asset expire or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset in a
transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred any
interest in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the group is recognised as a separate asset or
liability financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the consolidated statement of
financial position when and only when the group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle
on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously

loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market such assets are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs subsequent
to initial recognition loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less
any impairment losses loans and receivables comprise other financial asset long term receivable and trade and
other receivables and cash and cash equivalents

cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less
bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the groups cash management are
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows

ii nonderivative financial liabilities

the group initially recognises debt securities issued and subordinated liabilities on the date that they are
originated all other financial liabilities are recognised initially on the trade date at which the group becomes a
party to the contractual provisions of the instrument the group derecognises a financial liability when its
contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled or expire financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net
amount presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when and only when the group has a legal
right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously the groups nonderivative financial liabilities are loans and trade and other payables

such financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs
subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest method

iii share capital

ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are
recognised as a deduction from equity net of any tax effects




                                                                                                                           62

d property plant and equipment

property plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and less any accumulated
impairment losses cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset the cost of
selfconstructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour any other costs directly attributable to
bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use the cost of dismantling and removing the items
and restoring the site on which they are located and capitalised borrowing costs preproduction expenditure
relating to testing and commissioning is capitalised to property plant and equipment the recognition of costs in
the carrying amount of an asset ceases when the item is in the location and condition necessary to operate as
intended by management any net income earned while the item is not yet capable of operating as intended reduces
the capitalised amount

subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits
associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be reliably measured all other repairs
and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred

depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount which is the cost of an asset less its residual value and is
recognised in profit or loss depreciation methods and rates are applied consistently within each asset class except
where significant individual assets have been identified which have different economic useful lives residual
values depreciation methods and useful lives are reviewed at least annually depreciation is not adjusted
retrospectively for changes in the residual amount gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the
proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in profit or loss

i mine development and infrastructure

individual mining assets and deferred stripping costs are depreciated using the unitsofproduction method based on
the estimated economically recoverable metal during the life of mine plan mining costs incurred on development
activities comprising the removal of waste rock to initially expose ore at the mowana open pit mine commonly
referred to as deferred stripping costs are capitalised

land is shown at cost and not depreciated

ii mine plant and equipment

individual mining plant and equipment assets are depreciated using the unitsofproduction method based on the
estimated economically recoverable value during the life of mine plan

iii other assets

these assets are depreciated using the straightline method over the useful life of the asset as follows
 x    vehicles                              4 years
 x    information technology                3 years

e leased assets

leases in terms of which the group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
finance leases on initial recognition the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value
and the present value of the minimum lease payments subsequent to initial recognition the asset is accounted for
in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset other leases are operating leases and are not
recognised in the groups statement of financial position

f intangible assets

i goodwill

goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets for measurement of
goodwill at initial recognition see note 3aiii

subsequent measurement
goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses

ii mine development and infrastructure

mine development and infrastructure represents mineral and surface rights for parcels of land owned by the group

mineral and surface rights include acquired mineral use rights in production development and exploration phase
properties the amount capitalised related to a mineral and surface right represents its fair value at the time it was
acquired as part of a business combination and is recorded as cost of acquisition

the groups mineral use rights are enforceable regardless of whether proven or probable reserves have been
established

mineral and surface rights are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses

iii exploration and evaluation assets

all costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal right to undertake exploration and evaluation activities on a project
are writtenoff as incurred

exploration and evaluation costs arising following the acquisition of an exploration licence are capitalised on a
projectbyproject basis pending determination of the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the project
costs incurred include appropriate technical and administrative overheads capitalised exploration costs are carried
at historical cost less any impairment losses recognised

upon demonstration of the technical and commercial feasibility of a project any past capitalised exploration and
evaluation costs related to that project will be reclassified as intangible mine development and infrastructure

capitalised exploration expenditures are reviewed for impairment losses see accounting policy note below in line
with requirement of ifrs 6 exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources in the case of undeveloped
properties there may be only inferred resources to form a basis for the impairment review the review is based on
a status report regarding the groups intentions for development of the undeveloped property

iv subsequent expenditure

subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific
asset to which it relates all other expenditure including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands
is recognised in profit or loss as incurred

v amortisation

amortisation is calculated over the cost of the asset or other amount substituted for cost less its residual value
amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible
assets other than goodwill from the date that they are available for use since this most closely reflects the
expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset

mineral rights associated with production phase mineral interests are amortised over the life of mine using the
unitsofproduction method in order to match the amortisation with the expected underlying future cash flows
mineral interests associated with development and exploration phase mineral interests are not amortised until such
time as the underlying property is converted to the production stage

exploration and evaluation assets are not amortised

amortisation methods useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial yearend and adjusted if
appropriate

amortisation of intangible assets is included as part of other expenses in the statement of comprehensive income

g inventories

inventories of broken ore and concentrate are physically measured or estimated and valued at the lower of cost and
net realisable value nrv nrv is the estimate selling price in the ordinary course of business less the
estimated costs of completion and selling expenses

cost represents weighted average cost and includes direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable
overhead expenditure

inventories of consumable supplies and spare parts to be used in production are valued at weighted average cost

obsolete or damaged inventories are valued at nrv an ongoing review is undertaken to establish the extent of
surplus items and an allowance for impairment is raised for any potential loss on their disposal




                                                                                                                        65

h impairment

i financial assets including receivables

a financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine
whether there is objective evidence that it is impaired a financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates
that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that the loss event had a negative effect
on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated reliably objective evidence that financial
assets are impaired can include default or delinquency by a debtor restructuring of an amount due to the group on
terms that the group would not consider otherwise indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy or the
disappearance of an active market for a security

the group considers evidence of impairment for receivables at both a specific asset and collective level all
individually significant receivables are assessed for specific impairment all individually significant receivables
found not to be specifically impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but
not yet identified receivables that are not individually significant are collectively assessed for impairment by
grouping together receivables with similar risk characteristics in assessing collective impairment the group uses
historical trends of the probability of default timing of recoveries and the amount of loss incurred adjusted for
managements judgement as to whether current economic and credit conditions are such that the actual losses are
likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends

an impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference
between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the assets
original effective interest rate losses are recognised in profit or loss and reflected in an allowance account against
loans and receivables

when a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease the decrease in impairment loss is
reversed through profit or loss

ii nonfinancial assets

the carrying amounts of the groups nonfinancial assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets are
reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if any such indication
exists then the assets recoverable amount is estimated

for goodwill and intangible assets that are not yet available for use the recoverable amount is estimated each year
at the same time

the recoverable amount of an asset or cashgenerating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less
costs to sell in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a
pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to
the asset

for the purpose of impairment testing assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the
smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash
inflows of other assets or groups of assets the cashgenerating unit or cgu




                                                                                                                           66

h impairment  continued

ii nonfinancial assets continued

subject to an operating segment ceiling test for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing cgus to which
goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects the lowest level
at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes

goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cgus that are expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination the groups corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows if there is an
indication that a corporate asset may be impaired then the recoverable amount is determined for the cgu to which
the corporate asset belongs

an impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cgu exceeds its estimated recoverable
amount impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss impairment losses recognised in respect of cgus are
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying
amounts of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis an impairment loss in respect of
goodwill is not reversed

in respect of other assets impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any
indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed only to the
extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined net
of depreciation or amortisation if no impairment loss had been recognised

impairment reviews for capitalised exploration and evaluation assets are carried out on a projectbyproject basis
with each project representing a potential single cgu typically the following circumstances will indicate a
possible impairment
 x     unexpected geological occurrences that render the resource uneconomic
 x     title to the asset compromised
 x     variations in metal prices that render the project uneconomic and
 x     variations in the currency of the operation

i leases

lease payments

minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the
reduction of the outstanding liability the finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability




                                                                                                                         67

payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straightline basis over the term of the
lease

j provisions

a provision is recognised if as a result of a past event the group has a present legal or constructive obligation that
can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability the unwinding of the
discount is recognised as finance expense notional interest

provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate if it is no longer
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required the provision is reversed

environmental rehabilitation provisions
estimated long term environmental provisions comprising pollution control rehabilitation and mine closure are
based on the groups environmental policy taking into account current technological environmental and regulatory
requirements the provision for rehabilitation is recognised as and when the environmental liability arises to the
extent that the obligations relate to the construction of an asset they are capitalised as part of the cost of those
assets

the effect of subsequent changes to assumptions in estimating an obligation for which the provision was
recognised as part of the cost of the asset is recognised against the asset any subsequent changes to an obligation
which did not relate to the initial construction of a related asset are charged to profit or loss

k employee benefits

shortterm employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related
service is provided a liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under shortterm cash bonus or
profitsharing plans if the group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past
service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably

l sharebased payments

certain group employees and consultants are rewarded with equity settled sharebased instruments these are
measured at fair value at the date of grant and either expensed to profit and loss or capitalised to deferred
exploration costs based on the activity of the employee or consultant over the vesting period of the instrument

fair value is estimated using the blackscholes valuation model the estimated life of the instrument used in the
model is adjusted for managements best estimate of the effects of nontransferability exercise restrictions and
behavioural considerations

the proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value

m revenue recognition and measurement

revenue from sales of copper concentrate is recorded net of smelter treatment charges and deductions copper
concentrate is sold underpricing arrangements whereby revenue is recognised at the time of shipment delivery of
the products at the mine gate at which time legal title and risk pass to the customer and provisional revenue is
recorded at current month average price the quoted period established for each sale contract to finalise the sales
price is the month subsequent to the month of delivery within which the contract is required to be settled changes
between the prices recorded upon recognition of provisional revenue and final price due to fluctuation in copper
market prices result in the existence of an embedded derivative in the accounts receivable this embedded
derivative is closely related to the host contract and is therefore not separated

changes in the estimate of concentrate copper content resulting from the final independent analysis of the
concentrate are recognised at the point at which such analysis is agreed

n finance income and finance costs

finance income comprises interest income on funds invested interest income is recognised as it accrues in profit or
loss using the effective interest method

finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings unwinding of the discount on provisions and foreign
withholding taxes

borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition construction or production of a qualifying asset
are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method

o income tax

income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss
except to the extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or in other
comprehensive income

current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous
years

o income tax  continued

deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes deferred tax is not recognised for the
following temporary differences

 x     the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that
       affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss
 x     taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill
 x     temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries associates and jointly controlled entities to the
       extent that the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is
       probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future

deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date deferred tax assets and
liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to
income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities but they intend
to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised
simultaneously a deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses tax credits and deductible temporary
differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be
utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised

p earnings per share

the group presents basic and diluted earnings per share eps data for its ordinary shares basic eps is
calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period adjusted for own shares held diluted eps is
determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of
ordinary shares outstanding adjusted for own shares held and for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary
shares which comprise share options granted to employees

q group segment reporting

an operating segment is a component of the group that engages in business activities from which it may earn
revenues and incur expenses including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the groups
other components the groups only operating segment is the exploration for and the development and mining of
copper and other base metal deposits all the groups activities are related to the exploration for and the
development and mining of copper and other base metals in botswana with the support provided from acu and it
is reviewed as a whole by the board who is considered the chief operating decision maker to make decisions
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial
information is available all mining revenue derives from a single customer

as such no segmental report has been prepared

4 going concern

the directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis having considered the status of
current operations the current funding position and the projected funding requirements of the business for at least
12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements as detailed below

current operations and performance

the group incurred a loss after tax for the year ended 31 march 2013 of us16 million 2012 us358 million
loss

the companys direct subsidiary acu realised a significant increase in revenue up from us428 million in the
prior year to us605 million in 2013 as a result of the favourable increase in tonnes of copper concentrate sold
from 6245 tonnes in 2012 to 8692 tonnes during the 2013 financial year a further positive development was the
decrease in cost of sales down from us461 million in 2012 to us454 million in 2013 resulting in a decrease in
the average unit cost of copper concentrate produced per ton from us3186 in 2012 to us2321 during the 2013
financial year during 2013 consolidated administration and other costs excluding impairment losses remained
relatively stable and net consolidated foreign exchange losses also decreased additionally during the prior year
us 258 million of impairment losses were recorded which contributed to the loss reported in the fiscal year
2012 the group did not identify any further impairment indicators during the fiscal year 2013 and no further
impairment losses were recorded which contributed to the favourable decrease in the loss after tax for the 2013
year

the average copper produced in concentrate for the year amounted to 791 tonnes per month with the highest and
lowest months production yielding 1314 tonnes and 270 tonnes respectively as a result of record production
highs the mass of copper produced in concentrate enabled the business to generate positive cash flows from
operating activities over the year of us33 million there have been significant investing activities with additions
to property plant and equipment to maintain and expand operations resulting in a cash outflow from investing
activities of us83 million in addition cash outflow as a result of net repayment of interest bearing debt
amounted to us102 million during the year overall there has been a positive trend with a net decrease in
consolidated cash and cash equivalents of us6 million during 2013 compared to a decrease of us113 million in
the prior year

subsequent performance

since the year end copper produced in concentrate for the months of april and may was 540 and 1408 tonnes of
copper in concentrate respectively aprils production figures were slightly disappointing and arose as a result of
production issues around the performance of the mill which has been subject to some vibrations following a
production halt for three days for mill relining in may production returned to more normal levels with mill
throughput of 81000 tonnes achieved the source of the before mentioned vibrations have been identified and new
mill gear mechanisms have been ordered these are expected to be available for installation in september 2013
which would result in necessary mill downtime

cash flow forecast  key assumptions and uncertainties

the cash flow projections which have been drawn up on a monthly basis are based on a number of inputs and
assumptions which include mined tonnage all associated mining and processing costs extraction and yield rates
for production of the copper concentrate and the price of copper the groups approved capital expenditure is also
included in the cash flows




                                                                                                                         71

4 going concern  continued

in the opinion of the directors the key assumptions to which the projections are most sensitive are the tonnage of
produced copper concentrate and the copper price the tonnage of produced copper concentrate is itself a function
of mining output and recovery achieved in the processing operations key assumptions 12 months to june 2014

average copper price per tonne                                            us7390
average monthly production                                                1289 tonnes
average throughput                                                        83385 tonnes

the average price per tonne achieved during the financial year was us7839 2012 us8505

the average monthly production is a 629 increase over average production in fiscal 2013 however the 2013
average is significantly impacted by the low production in may 2012 the low production in may 2012 was as a
result of a mechanical failure in the processing plant and a resulting shutdown from 20 may until 5 june 2012 the
lower production in january and february 2013 were as a result of the mining contractor at thakadu giving notice
of termination of contract exiting from the mine during january 2013 the assumed production is a 43 increase
over the average production for the fiscal year 2013 excluding the months of may 2012 january and february
2013

the forecast average throughput of 83385 tonnes is only 24 higher than the 66825 average throughput achieved
during the year ended 31 march 2013 and 11 higher should the months of may 2012 january and february 2013
be excluded from the comparison

although the group has demonstrated its ability to produce at a sustainable monthly level during the second half of
the financial year being reported on the thakadu pit will be depleted within the next 12 months and the groups
future cash generation beyond 2014 is entirely reliant on a successful and timely restart of mining operations at the
mowana pit and associated processing of the supergene ore if there is a material slippage in the timetable for
bringing the mowana pit back into production the group may not have sufficient funds to meet its costs

projected funding requirements

the directors believe that the projections for at least the twelve months to august 2014 are achievable based on
the higher grade and recovery profile of the thakadu ore anticipated to be mined and processed until may 2014 and
a planned switch to mowana ore in june 2014 a conservative view on consensus analyst projections for the copper
price the production targets and the cost factors used in the forecast

the projections show that if the key operational and pricing assumptions are achieved the existing loan facilities
will be sufficient to provide the necessary funding for the company and its subsidiaries for at least the next twelve
months from the date of approval of these financial statements
by way of illustrating other downside sensitivities in the projection a combination of

 x    average copper price for the period 1 june 2013 to 31 december 2013 lowered to the spot price of 328 per
      pound at the time of performing the sensitivity analysis
 x    shortfalls in the average copper price of up to 5
 x    shortfalls in production throughput of up to 5 and
 x    shortfalls in average recoveries of up to 5

would result in an additional funding requirement of up to us147 million all other assumptions unchanged and
additionally

 x    a possible shutdown of operations for approximately 30 days in the event of a critical equipment failure

would result in an additional funding requirement of up to us43 million all other assumptions unchanged

                                                                                                                        72

4 going concern  continued

in light of the above sensitivities the directors of zci extended a letter of financial support to acu confirming
that zci will continue to make sufficient financial resources available to allow acu to meet its liabilities as they
fall due in the course of normal operations furthermore to ensure that zci has the ability to provide such support
based on existing and any additional funding requirements subsequent to year end the company obtained an
extension on a letter of financial support from its controlling shareholder to the value of us7 million

conclusion

uncertainties surrounding the switchover of mining operations and processing of ore from the thakadu pit to the
mowana pit together with the volatility of the copper price may have a significant impact on the directors use of
the going concern assumption should the projected production levels and key financial assumptions not be
achieved the company and its subsidiaries will have to source additional external funding in order to realise their
assets and discharge their liabilities in the normal course of business in the event that additional funding is not
forthcoming these conditions may cast significant doubt about the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to
continue as going concerns and therefore to continue realising their assets and discharging their liabilities in the
normal course of business

impairment review

the group performed an impairment test with respect to the carrying value of property plant and equipment as
well as intangible assets relating to the operations where mining is currently taking place this is considered to be
one cash generating unit together key assumptions include the following

      a revised 65 year mine plan based on processing 5 million tonnes of the mowana mines proven and
       probable reserves and 1 million tonnes of the thakadu pits probable reserves
      discount rate of 11
      average production throughput levels of 80324 tonnes per month to march 2014 with average production
       levels of approximately 81000 tonnes thereafter
      copper sales prices forecasted at end of may spot price of us328 per lb until december 2013 and by
       selected analyst estimates thereafter with the average copper price over the life of mine from january 2014
       of approximately us320 per lb


                                                                                                                        77

impairment review  continued

     grade assumptions based on a 10 reduction of the mowana and thakadu resource model grades which
      experience has shown to be reasonably predictive of the actual grades mined averaging 147 and 177
      respectively
     recovery rates based on historical independent metallurgy and plant testwork
     operating and capital costs based on historical costs and approved budget costs

as required by ias 36 no benefit has been recognised for any additional value that could be generated from the
assets through improving the performance of the assets through additional cash outflows from the development of
underground workings or from production beyond the five year mine plan

the outcome of the valueinuse calculation did not indicate any further impairment of the carrying value of
property plant and equipment or the intangible assets relating to the operations where mining is currently taking
place

during the prior year an impairment loss of us257 million us15 million relating to property plant and
equipment and us107 million relating to intangible assets was recognised as part of other expenses in the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income the directors are of the opinion that the results of the value in
use calculation did not support the reversal of impairment losses recognised in past periods

12 intangible assets  continued

for purposes of impairment testing the directors consider each of the groups exploration and development assets
on a projectbyproject basis currently there are two projects that are separately identifiable cash generating units
 x     exploration expenditures on areas within the mowana tenements but which have not yet been exploited and
       do not form part of the current declared resources mowana underground resources
 x     exploration expenditures on the matsitama tenements

as at 31 march 2013 license numbers pl332005 and pl802008 situated within the mowana tenements are post
expiry date it is the directors intention to retain the licenses and applications for renewal have been submitted as
at the date of these consolidated financial statements confirmation of renewal remain outstanding and as a result
management considers this to be an impairment indicator consequently exploration expenditures of us2025
million has been impaired in the current period and recognised as part of other expenses in the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income

no impairment indicators were identified for exploration expenditures relating to the matsitama project

mine development and infrastructure includes preoperating cost mining rights and exploration expenditures
related to mowana and thakadu open pits these are considered as part of the mining operations for purposes of
impairment testing for details assumptions used and outcome refer to note 11

updated by geoflux pty limited in 2011 to take into account the escalation of mowana estimate and the new
estimate for thakadu open pit

mine including the mowana and thakadu open pits site at closure 2012 us054 million was set aside based on
initial provision the cash provision is set aside on the rate of reserves depletion basis the group will annually
make contributions to this account over the life of the mine so as to ensure these capital contributions together with
the investment income earned cover the anticipated costs

25 contingent liability
as disclosed in the 31 march 2012 annual report and interim financial statements for the period ended 30
september 2012 the company previously entered into an investment advisory and management agreement the
iama with icapital mauritius limited icapital the contract was terminated with effect from 1 january
2012 as at 31 march 2013 the dispute with regards to the interpretation of certain clauses was still ongoing

during the 2013 year an advance payment deed was executed by the parties in relation to the fixed fee claims
under the iama resulting in a payment of us1 million by the company to icapital and recognised as part of
other expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income




                                                                                                                   88

25 contingent liability  continued
subsequent to the year end the company and icapital reached a settlement and relating settlement deeds have been
signed and placed in escrow the terms of the settlement in respect of the performance fees are summarised as
follows

 x    a payment of us2 million in relation to the performance fee for the period from 1 january 2009 to 31
      march 2011 in terms of the iama and
 x    a settlement deed in relation to the performance fee for the period from 1 april 2011 to the date of
      termination of the contract which applies in the event that no disposal of any of the company shareholding
      in its subsidiary acu is completed by 1 june 2013 in which case icapital is compensated by a transfer of
      185 of the acu shares held by the company share transfer deed and
 x    the share transfer deed includes tag along and drag rights provisions which allows the company flexibility
      should a future disposal of its shareholding in acu be considered

settlement and payment of us2 million in relation to the initial performance fee has been completed subsequent
to the financial year end

given that icapital is a related party refer note 21 the terms of the settlement are subject to a fair and
reasonableness opinion as per the listing requirements of the jse and are conditional upon the approval of zcis
shareholders in terms of the listings requirements of the jse a related party transaction requires that an
independent professional expert acceptable to the jse must conclude that the terms and conditions of the proposed
settlement are fair and reasonable as far as the shareholders of the company are concerned accordingly the
directors have commenced the process to retain counsel and initiate the process to obtain necessary shareholder
approval as a result of the required approval process no liability have been recognised in the 2013 financial year
for neither the cash payment nor settlement in shares as the outcome of this process is still uncertain

if the companys shareholders do not approve the terms of the settlement as the case may be by 31 october 2013
the dispute will not be settled and the parties will in effect revert to the procedure set out in the iama in this
case any performance fee that the company might be required to pay under the iama will be adjusted to take into
account the us2 million payment that the company has already paid to icapital contingent asset

commodity contracts or other hedging contracts or techniques to mitigate risks the main risks for which such
instruments may be appropriate are market risk including interest rate risk foreign exchange risk and commodity
price risk and liquidity risk each of which is discussed below

the groups principal financial liabilities comprise an interest bearing debt trade and other payables and a bank
overdraft the groups financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents trade and other receivables and other
financial assets

all of the groups financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities and are measured at amortised cost
and all of the groups financial assets are classified as loans and receivables carried at amortised cost less
impairment losses

the fair value of the groups financial instruments approximates their carrying value as shown in the statement of
financial position

the groups activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks which include interest rate risk foreign currency
risk commodity price risk credit risk liquidity risk and capital risk there were no changes during the year with
regards to the groups objectives policies and processes for managing these risks

a market risk

i interest rate risk

interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will
fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates interest rate risk arises from interest bearing financial assets and
liabilities that the group uses interest bearing assets comprise of fixedrate receivables and cash and cash
equivalents which are considered to be shortterm liquid assets

the group generally does not undertake any specific action to cover its exposure to interest rate risk although it
may do so in specific circumstances

fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency rates the group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of
financial assets and liabilities of the company and its subsidiaries determined in currencies other than their
functional currency the group has not used forward exchange contracts to manage this risk

the table below shows the currency profiles of cash and cash equivalents

                                                                               2013                      2012

as a result of the groups main assets and subsidiaries being held in botswana and having a functional currency
different than the presentation currency note 3b the groups balance sheet can be affected significantly by
movements in the us dollar to the botswana pula the group does not hedge its exposure of foreign investments
held in foreign currencies

a 10 strengthening or weakening of the various functional currencies against the relevant foreign currencies

the analysis assumes that all other variables in particular interest rates remain constant

iii commodity price risk

commodity price risk is the risk that the groups future earnings will be adversely impacted by changes in the
market prices of commodities the group is exposed to commodity price risk as it sells its copper concentrate
underpricing arrangements whereby the quoted period established for each sale contract to finalise the sales price
is the month subsequent to the month of delivery within which the contract is required to be settled changes
between the prices recorded upon recognition of provisional revenue and final price due to fluctuation in copper
market prices result in the existence of an embedded derivative in the trade receivable

from time to time the group may manage its exposure to commodity price risk by entering into put contracts or
metal forward sales contracts with the goal of preserving its future revenue streams no such contracts were entered
into during the year as at 31 march 2013 with other variables unchanged a plus or minus 1 change in
commodity prices on sales revenue would affect the loss for the year by plus or minus us627333 for the year
2012 us536515

b credit risk

credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations

the group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables note 14
which also represent the maximum exposure to credit risk the group deposits surplus cash only with well
established financial institutions of high quality credit standing

credit risk exposure is further managed through the off take agreement with its customers as upfront payment for
95 of each invoice amount is required the group has been transacting with this customer for more than two
years and no impairment losses have ever been recognised against the customer




                                                                                                                          93

million in trade and other payables and us191 million 2012 us621 million due to banc abc

prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of
committed credit facilities further analysis around the risks and uncertainties relating to the going concern basis of
preparation is provided in note 4 the group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows
and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities

                                                      2013                                       2012

d capital risk management

the primary objective of managing the groups capital is to ensure that there is sufficient capital available to
support the funding and operating requirements of the group in a way that optimises the cost of capital maximizes
shareholders returns matches the strategic business plan and ensures that the group remains in a sound financial
position

capital consists of issued share capital and reserves should more capital be required the group will consider
raising additional equity market or bank debt or hybrids thereof

there were no changes to the groups approach to capital management during the year

29 ultimate controlling entity

the companys ultimate controlling party is the copperbelt development foundation
