                  capitals
           dawn believes that the value of its business is a reflection of the quality of the capital underpinning it which yields a model
           that is sustainable in the longterm the group invests in its capitals to ensure its future leadership and accountability and to
           generate value for its stakeholders


                        financial capital
           financial capital is the traditional primary measure of business performance and success the single bottom line in terms
           of reporting performance to shareholders investors regulators and government dawn has adopted a triple bottom line
           approach in its reporting as it acknowledges the dependence on other forms of capital in the creation of financial value

           dawn enhances it financial capital by
              ensuring that the groups financial measures reflect the value of the other five capitals
              valuing intangible assets such as brand and reputation to reflect their contribution to shareholder value
              internalising environmental and social costs and benefits and assigning an economic value to them
              managing opportunities risks and corporate governance issues
              demonstrating a positive stance on and management of sustainability issues to improve access to financial capital
               or reducing financing costs by meeting socially responsible investment criteria and reducing insurance premiums as

            dawn and south africas economic landscape
            dawn reported significant progress during the first six months of the financial year with the implementation of its
            turnaround strategy however dawns results for the second half of the year have been severely impacted by
             	a loss in 49held grohe dawn watertech gdw which had an adverse impact on the total earnings of the group
                directly impacting earnings at associate level and in the trading division of the building segment being gdws largest
                customer
            	a slowdown in governmentspend and payments impacting the trading division of the infrastructure segment
            	difficult trading conditions and currency losses in the africa operations and
            	lossmaking and noncore subsidiary businesses detracting from the performance of the group

            the total losses after tax incurred in certain subsidiary businesses and the associate gdw amounted to r1300 million
            causing management to make significant impairments amounting to a net r637 million to the carrying values of these
            investments restatements which included the restatement of an operating lease liability a written put liability and a share
            based payment obligation are addressed in note 10 to the audited summary consolidated financial statements

            south africas economic landscape continued to be impacted by high levels of unemployment and low productivity
            interest rate hikes a weakening and volatile currency and rising inflation with the outlook for domestic economic growth
            deteriorating as the year progressed

            real annual gross domestic product gdp growth deteriorated to 13 in 2015 with growth of 09 expected for 2016
            inflationary pressures have intensified mainly due to the worst drought in more than a century driving up food costs and
            the added pressure on consumer prices caused by the rands 25 fall against the dollar last year annual consumer price
            inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi was 63 in march 2016 down from 70 in february 2016 with
            prices not decreasing but rather increasing at a slower annual rate and is expected to average 66 for 2016 the south
            african reserve banks monetary policy committee estimates that inflation will only return to its target range of between 3
            and 6 in the final quarter of 2017

            the civil confidence index after rising marginally to 42 points in the last quarter of 2015 dropped by 14 points in the first
            quarter of 2016 to 28 points this is the lowest level for the index since the last quarter of 2011 the drop was to a large
            extent influenced by a sharp slowdown in construction activity and a marked uptick in tendering price competition

            consumer confidence showed some recovery and increased to 9 in the first quarter of 2016 14 in the fourth quarter of
            2015 however underlying conditions remain unsupportive of a meaningful acceleration in consumer spending going
            forward depressed consumer confidence indicates a low willingness among households to spend and utilise credit

            against this background of a slowing economy and with limited prospects of any significant improvement in domestic
            economic conditions to stimulate consumer disposable income the trading environment is likely to remain constrained for
            the foreseeable future

            dawn management is focused on
     2016
               improving efficiencies of the dawn distribution business model
               further consolidating group businesses for cost reductions


16          	utilising crossselling across the group to improve stock alignment with customer requirements with a clear focus on


            
               profits and returns not sales and
                the turnaround of lossmaking business and improving working capital management throughout the group

new management has been introduced in key operational positions including the ceo position stephen connelly joined the board
as independent nonexecutive director on 1 april 2016 and following derek tods retirement on 31 may 2016 was appointed as
interim chief executive officer on 1 june 2016 initially on a sixmonth appointment which has now been extended to 12 months and
the board thanks him for assisting the company in these challenging times and wishes him success


corporate governance
the board and individual directors are committed to the principles of transparency integrity responsibility and accountability and
accept their duty to ensure that the principles set out in the code of corporate practices and conduct as defined in the king iii

facilitate disclosure and transparency


executive remuneration
at the annual general meeting held on 20 november 2015 the nonbinding advisory vote resolution presented to shareholders
pertaining to the remuneration policy had a low margin of acceptance

the board confirms that the 2015 policy which was based solely on key performance indicators kpis of individual executives
without taking into consideration the financial performance of the group was not applied notwithstanding the achievement of
kpis by dawn executives and prescribed officers the shortterm bonuses were not approved by the board as a result of the losses
incurred by dawn for the financial year ended 31 march 2015 and this decision was fully supported by the executive management
team

in terms of the 2016 policy the board has identified certain aspects of this policy that needed to be assessed a resolution will be
presented to shareholders at the annual general meeting to be held on 18 november 2016 to pass a nonbinding advisory vote on
the 2016 remuneration policy details of the policy are outlined in the report of the remuneration committee on pages 59 to 79

the terms of reference of the remuneration committee has been updated to include the requirement for shareholders in general
meeting to approve any ex gratia bonus payments to individuals

following the successful conclusion of the grohe transaction in october 2014 derek tod and dries ferreira received bonuses of
r5 million and r2 million respectively unfortunately the dawn group did not perform according to expectations for the full
year ended 31 march 2015 and it was agreed to reverse the bonuses concerned statutory and regulatory implications have been
addressed and the bonuses have been paid back


appreciation
i want to thank dawn shareholders for their support during difficult times and the management team for their leadership as well as
the employees for their enduring commitment a special word of thanks to tak hiemstra and derek tod for their contributions over
many years since the inception of dawn i also want to thank my fellow board members for their dedication during the past
year

14 july 2016

                 ceo and
     financial directors
              report
            in the interim results to 30 september 2015 dawn reported significant progress in the implementation of its turnaround
            strategy however the second half of the financial year was severely impacted by a sharp economic slowdown and a lag in
            government spend on water projects which resulted in losses in a number of businesses
            grohe dawn watertech gdw in which dawn holds a minority 49 stake was also impacted by delayed approval
            of working capital funding which disrupted the supplychain and had an impact on earnings at the associate company
            investment level as well as on the building trading segment of dawn gdws largest customer
            lower resource prices foreign exchange volatility and scarcity and political instability also impacted adversely on dawns
            business in the rest of africa
            thus group sales came under severe pressure in the second half the management team responded by lowering prices
            to maintain historical volumes this only served to exacerbate the impact of the reduction in sales by also reducing gross
            margins although the groups operating expenses were trimmed back aggressively it has a high fixed cost base which does
            not allow further cost reductions in the shortterm


                         financial capital

            group operating margin therefore decreased from 35 in h1 f2016 to a loss for f2016 the subsidiary businesses which
            moved into losses were sangio incledon promax dawn kitchen division dkd dawn africa and dpi international as well
            as associates gdw and some africa operations total losses after tax including gdw amounted to r1300 million based
            on historical results and future expectations of investments the board has decided to make significant impairments to the
            carrying value of these investments

            these losses continued into the first quarter of f2017 under the guidance of new management the group prioritised plans
            to halt the losses move back into profit and bring working capital back to normal levels a plan to achieve this was approved
            by the executive committee and the board of directors at the end of june 2016 and significant progress toward these goals is
            expected during the second quarter of f2017
            earnings for f2016 are therefore as follows
            	an operating loss before tax interest impairments and derecognitions of r239 million nine months f2015 a loss of
               r801 million
             	a headline loss per share of 656 cents nine months f2015 a headline loss of 281 cents per share and
             	a loss per share of 3183 cents nine months f2015 loss per share of 2021 cents

group strategy
dawns business model is to be the master distributor in targeted industry sectors the models competitive
advantage centres on the broad disposable income and population distribution in the markets it serves this creates
a number of barriers to entry for competitors such as a high establishment cost together with a requirement for
technical expertise in its warehouse and logistics services traditional carriers are not geared for breakbulk storage                  2016

and distribution dawns key competitive advantage is vested in its 100 coverage of southern african markets
through its milkrun distribution model combined with its breakbulk and justintime service

             forwardlooking statement

             it is anticipated that economic conditions in south africa and neighbouring countries will remain very difficult for some time
             sales will therefore remain under pressure most of the lossmaking businesses will unfortunately continue to make losses in
             q1 f2017

     2016
             the main focus in f2017 q2 will be
             1 whs  increasing the gross margin



20
             2 incledon  stemming losses through a restructuring
             3 gdw  return to profitability and
             4 cash flow  reducing excess working capital to align with the sales reality

on the cost front 1 july salary increases have been foregone and a hiring freeze instituted other costcutting opportunities
are being explored an objective has been set to move operating profit margins in the direction of 5 in the trading and 12
in the manufacturing businesses

in the mediumterm duplicated activities will be eliminated and central services costs challenged and benchmarked
securing supplier loyalty will be a priority the focus of the business will be changed to profits and returns not sales non
core businesses will be disposed of and a culture of accountability will be instilled in the business

the board believes that these steps whilst not an immediate fix for the groups woes should deliver benefits for stakeholders
in the mediumterm

any forwardlooking statement in these results have not been reviewed or audited by the companys auditors

            grohe experienced severe problems with its investment in china and consequently did not pay sufficient attention to
            its south african investment a funding impasse caused a significant impact on the businesses supplychain and factory

             financial capital
sales for building trading rose by 38 to r25 billion f2015 r18 billion a 10 price increase was achieved but volumes
declined by 3 whilst the annualisation from nine months added a notional 31 growth dawns focus on increasing
volume over the existing cost base resulted in the acquisition of hamiltons together with the distribution rights of the grass
and gardena brands in the first half of the year under review

gdw incurred a substantial r322 million loss for dawns 49 stake in the business lixil grohes parent company has since
intervened and implemented management changes this together with a funding solution implemented in july 2016
should result in gdw returning to profits in the second quarter of f2017

associate heunis steel performed in line with expectations and its contribution to group earnings increased by 3

the building segment incurred a net loss after tax impairments and writedowns of r4946 million

outlook
trading conditions and gross margins are expected to remain under pressure for the foreseeable future limited
opportunities for further costs reductions exist in the building segment working capital reduction will be a priority in the
year ahead focus will be on driving an increase in gross margin whilst aiming for a 5 operating profit and six times asset
turn lossmaking entities will be fixed sold or closed

at gdw a new management team was appointed in q4 f2016 and additional funding was provided by lixil in july 2016
the supplychain correction should materialise by q2 f2017 intervention by lixil at the ceramics plant is expected to restore
yields to the levels prior to the transaction between grohe and dawn

            overview
            the pvc pipe manufacturers performed reasonably well with dpi swan and ubuntu increasing profit after tax but off
            a weak base in f2015 impacted by strike and power disruptions backup power generators have since been installed
            sangio the hdpe pipe manufacturer made a substantial loss impacted by the mining slowdown across africa

            incledon came under severe pressure during the second half and lost r220 million in revenue compared to h1 f2016
            causing overall revenue to decline by 4 yearonyear this was caused mainly by the mining and civil engineering sector
            slowdowns as a result of this decline in revenue incledon responded by chasing sales on price causing gross margins to
            decline substantially and pushing the business into a significant loss the lack of government spend and payments drove a
            large part of incledon debtors book into an overdue situation

     2016
            two joint ventures in this segment aqualia mauritius and simba tanzania broke even fibrex angola an associate
            was impacted by a weak economy and the lack of foreign currency resulting in operating losses despite a small profit

             financial capital
revenue amounted to r24 billion in the 12 months to 31 march 2016 f2015 r18 billion an increase of 38 driven by a 6
increase in price but offset by a 4 decline in volumes as sangios hdpe pipe business which is exposed to the declining
mining industry and incledon which is exposed to declining government water spend came under severe pressure the
annualisation from nine months added a notional 36 growth

the infrastructure segment incurred a net loss after tax impairments and writedowns of r2191 million

outlook
dpi swan and ubuntu are performing satisfactorily but margin improvements will be sought at dpi in the year ahead the
aim will be to achieve a 12 operating profit and 25 times asset turn a major restructuring will be undertaken at sangio
during q2 f2017 but the business is expected to make a loss in h1 f2017

at incledon sales are under huge pressures with an expected drop of 30 on the top line and a loss being incurred in h1
f2017 new management was appointed in q1 f2017 with a major restructuring planned for q2 2017 working capital
reduction will be a priority in the year ahead the aim will be to achieve a 5 operating profit and six times asset turn

the fibrex associate business in angola will be mothballed at the end of q1 f2017 joint venture simba in tanzania is
expected to return to more normal trading conditions post the elections in that country the joint venture in mauritius
aqualia will either be mothballed or dawn will disinvest from this business

             systems it and dawn strategy with college of production and technology as an associate

             overview
             logistics achieved an operational breakeven as a result of improved operating efficiencies stemming from the
             new it systems implemented and optimised over the last couple of periods the group believes that the footprint of
             this operation can be further leveraged for cost and working capital optimisation other services performed in line
             with expectation and continue to focus on growing its nongroup and rest of africa footprint ingroup costcutting
             initiatives led to less recruitment and training activity for dawn human resources

                           financial capital
             revenue for solutions grew by 50 to r5714 million in the 12 months to 31 march 2016 f2015 r3801 million this
             represents a 9 growth in price and a 7 improvement in volume whilst the annualisation from nine months added a
             notional 34 growth

             the solutions segment incurred a net loss after tax impairments and writedowns of r449 million

             outlook
             in playing an anchor role in the turnaround strategy of the group the shared services companies and dawn logistics
             have started significant cost and efficiency review programmes opportunities to gain more external revenue streams
     2016
             are being pursued and it is expected that this will support subsidisation of services and logistics costs to group
             companies most significantly the logistics footprint will be reviewed this will bring massive costsaving benefits



26
             whilst the new it systems will ensure that service levels to customers will be maintained in the shortterm and
             increased in the mediumterm

             despite the fact that the solutions segment will continue to experience pressure on internal revenue streams as the
             group companies look for more economies management is confident that the segment will continue to add value to
             the profit line through implementation of new service delivery models

            staff turnover
            the internationally recognised way of calculating labour turnover is as follows employees who resign are retrenched retire
            leave due to mutually agreed settlements and longterm contracts that are ended


                                                       number of employees leaving during period
                                                                                                        x 100
                                                        average number employed during period


            the absenteeism issues are most prevalent in the manufacturing businesses which is quite normal physical strains monotony
            of the work and motivation levels are the cause the hr strategies approved for the manufacturing businesses in the
            infrastructure segment have elements aimed at improving the causes of absenteeism

            industry information about absenteeism
            absenteeism should be at about 15 which means that for every 250 working days per year the average employee should
            take 375 days off most south african companies have an overall absenteeism rate of between 35 and 6 way over the
            acceptable limit
               1408 of the total sick absenteeism incidents in corporate south africa were related to influenza
               138 of all sick leaves taken by males were due to influenza
               influenza accounted for 1155 of all sick leaves taken in the female segment of the 150 000 strong sample
               714 of the total incidents related to back pain and back symptom complaints
               the second highest reason for sick leave amongst males was lower back pain
               for women the second highest reason for sick leave taken was acute bronchitis
               609 of the total sick leave incidents related to gastroenteritis
            	the biggest difference in sick leave diagnosis between males and females was depressive disorder while a mere 070 of
               men took sick leave because of depressive disorders it accounted for 12 of sick leave taken by women

            the staff turnover rate for dawn and its subsidiaries based on the above calculations has been 3056 for the 2016 financial
            year with an absenteeism rate of 136 comparative rates for the prior year are not available as the calculation method has
            been changed in line with international best practice

going forward
strategic training and development interventions in line with the groups strategy will be finetuned and continuously
implemented within all businesses in the group the intent is entrenched in the five pillars of dawn namely customer
centricity planning sourcing and forecasting worldclass logistics capability africa business development strategy and
leadership and culture change building core capabilities and transformation alignment are key features of the strategic
interventions which include a blended learning approach

the offering aligned to the strategic objective will continue to include customer care and customer relationship
management financial management applied logistics and supplychain management learnership a sales in africa course
leadership managementsupervisory development programmes including generic management learnership sales in
terms of the wholesale and retail supervisory learnership and project management a fair amount of focus will be placed on
internshipsapprenticeshipslearnerships in order to provide the youth with an opportunity to gain work experience and also
maximise on bbbee skills development point accumulation

the rollout of the groups technology upgrades are still being implemented across the businesses with different go live
stages at present the main aim is to roll out multiple enterprise resource planning modules to address different divisional
workflows across the businesses thereby creating standardisation the latter has resulted in a significant increase in        2016

a structured approach to performance and career development reviews is currently only applied at senior management
level across dawn group companies informal performance management is in place at all other levels of employment
human resources is however currently leading a project to address the gaps identified at all other levels this team
will be addressing matters such as policy process and templates with training following thereafter once completed
performance management will be implemented across the group in formalised cycles where submission will be tracked
by the relevant human resources managers

            carbon footprint
            for the year ended 31 march 2016 activities of the dawn group generated a carbon footprint of 63 392 co₂e tonnes this includes
            all activities under scope 1 and scope 2 as well as business travel under scope 3 nine months f2015 39 953 co₂e tonnes

            scope 1
            diesel and petrol jointly are the second most important energy carriers in the dawn group with 3927 million litres of diesel nine
            months f2015 3249 million litres and 1384 million litres of petrol nine months f2015 1369 million litres being used  resulting
            in 13 665 co₂e tonnes from transport and distribution nine months f2015 11 820 co₂e tonnes diesel is primarily used in the
            transportation component of the distribution model to get manufactured goods to wholesale locations as well as to deliver
            wholesale goods to retail customers petrol is primarily used by sales personnel to promote and sell products a small amount of
            diesel is being used in factories and warehouses by forklifts lpg gas consumption amounted to 24 430 litres which generated 365
            co₂e tonnes of carbon based on low materiality 1 and insignificant changes in the installed equipment that cause fugitive
            emissions from previous periods refrigeration and airconditioning  a weighted average from the last three periods results in an
            estimate of 604 co₂e tonnes for f2016

            historically the third most significant individual contributor to the carbon footprint was in the form of natural gas consumption of
            4726 million m³ in f2014 f2013 4505 million m³ resulting in a carbon footprint of 9 754 co₂e tonnes in f2014 f2013 9 100 co₂e
            tonnes this energy source is used to power kilns furnaces and boilers at three of the now associate manufacturing locations which
            formed part of the grohe dawn watertech transaction as these operations are now associates they were excluded from the carbon
            footprint for f2015 and are again excluded for the f2016 financial year this information is included as other operations in the dawn
            group do not utilise natural gas or importantly are not in the position to use this alternate energy carrier due to the technical
            application of energy in the manufacturing technology process

            scope 2
            the primary contributor to the carbon footprint emanated from scope 2 emissions in the form of electricity consumption of 46 702
            mwh nine months f2015 27 914 mwh resulting in a country specific weighted emission factors for grid electricity and solar pv
            of 47 257 co₂e tonnes nine months f2015 28 128 co₂e tonnes which equals 745 nine months f2015 70 of the total carbon
            footprint electricity is used at all of the 45 locations across the group with large consumption being recorded at particularly the pipe
            manufacturing locations reporting is based on the 28 subsidiary businesses

            the top five subsidiaries use 937 of the dawn groups total electricity consumption in order of magnitude these are dpi plastics
            23 650 mwh swan plastics 9 050 mwh sangio pipe 6 472 mwh ddc 3 552 mwh and npc 1 584 mwh

            during the year backup power generators have been installed at the pvc pipe manufacturing businesses in the infrastructure
            segment

            scope 3
            a selected category under scope 3 has been taken under review with the support of a thirdparty for the first time this process
            assured the gathering of reliable data gathering and verification of data provided business travel on a flight and car rental basis
            accounted for 1 8297 co₂e tonnes for f2016

            segmental analysis
     2016
            the segmental analysis of the carbon footprint indicates that
             	the building segment generated a carbon footprint of 4 889 tonnes of co₂e nine months f2015 3 098 tonnes of co₂e  77


36              nine months f2015 78 of the total
             	the infrastructure segment generated a carbon footprint of 46 698 tonnes of co₂e nine months f2015 29 850 tonnes of co₂e 
                737 nine months f2015 747 of the total and
            	the solutions segment generated a carbon footprint of 11 805 tonnes of co₂e nine months f2015 7 005 tonnes of co₂e 
               186 nine months f2015 175 of the total

summary
in summary during f2016 energy in the form of electricity diesel petrol and lpg gas accounted for 63 392 co₂e tonnes nine
months f2015 39 953 co₂e tonnes of carbon emissions which amounted to 962 nine months f2015 9978 of the total
carbon footprint of the group fugitive emissions from the refill of airconditioners and refrigeration plants together with
business travel made up the remainder of the emissions the carbon footprint generated by the use of fugitive emissions
amounted to 604 tonnes nine months f2015 1 117 co₂e tonnes with business travel generating 1 830 co₂e tonnes of carbon

verification
the carbon footprint data is based on scope1 and scope 2 emissions as well as business travel which is a scope 3 emission
riskbased assurance was provided by internal audit in this regard fugitive emissions from the refill of airconditioners and
refrigeration plants made up the remainder of the emissions the carbon footprint generated by the use of these products
amounted to 604 tonnes nine months f2015 1 117 co₂e tonnes

water
water sources large roofed areas and a borehole have been identified at the ddc in germiston for the supply of potable
water produced on site a balance between production and use was established

during the year piping routes from roof catchment to a reservoir were determined and a borehole was drilled water quality
proved a challenge due to high levels of iron and other heavy metals the borehole delivered a yield of 18 kilolitre per day in
mitigation filtration treatment and pumping solutions were specified and sourced

an overall review of the existing water system at the ddc was undertaken and a maintenance programme was put in place to
repair all leaks

the casting of bases for raw and clean water tanks tanks and piping was completed during q1 f2017

the aim is to produce most of the potable water used on the site by reducing waste and establishing a stable supply with
low maintenance intervals

            pertaining to the nonbinding advisory endorsement relating to executive remuneration had a low margin of acceptance
            in terms of the policy shortterm incentives would be based solely on financial performance without considering individual
            key performance indicators kpis longterm incentives would be based on kpis and could take the form of either deferred
            cash bonuses or share incentives

subsequent to the annual general meeting the board consulted with professional advisors on the matter to ensure that the
remuneration policy is aligned with benchmarking and best practice the key objectives were to ensure that dawn is able to
employ and retain top talent going forward whilst simultaneously balancing shareholder interests

a summary of the realigned remuneration policy applicable from financial year 2017 is outlined below and a resolution will be
presented to shareholders for approval by a nonbinding advisory vote at the annual general meeting to be held on friday
18 november 2016

as a result of the losses incurred by dawn for the financial period ended 31 march 2015 notwithstanding the achievement of
kpis by dawn executives and prescribed officers the shortterm bonuses were not approved by the board and this decision was
fully supported by the executive management team

similarly given the results for the period to 31 march 2016 no bonuses will be paid to the executive directors and prescribed
officers

            performance parameters of which 35 will be earned based on pbit and 35 based on roic

            a system of threetier targets will be used to determine bonuses earned for company performance see table 2 the bonus
            payable to an executive will be equal to the target bonus if the specified target was met should the target be missed but
            the minimum threshold still be achieved a lower percentage of the target bonus will be payable should the target be
            exceeded and the stretch target be achieved then a higher percentage than the target bonus will be payable

dawn will apply the following threetier target model to calculate bonuses earned for company performance using a linear
sliding scale from threshold to stretch

               fixed term contracts should not exceed three years but may provide for an extension
               all agreements should contain a restraint of trade clause with a term of not less than a year clearly defining the
                companys protectable interest
               contracts should not commit the company to pay on termination arising from the directors failure
               balloon payments on termination are not seen as fair remuneration policy and
               if a director is dismissed because of a disciplinary procedure a shorter notice period should apply without entitlement
                for compensation for the shorter notice period if a dismissal takes place as a result of a gross misconduct no notice
                period should apply

these circumstances that the group retains or attracts nonexecutive directors with the necessary experience and credentials

directors are remunerated substantially below market average

average

at the annual general meeting to be held on friday 18 november 2016 shareholders will be requested to approve the following

statement of responsibility and
approval by the board of directors
for the twelve months ended 31 march 2016




the directors are required in terms of the companies act no 71 of 2008 to maintain adequate accounting records and
are responsible for the content and integrity of the annual financial statements and related financial information included
in this report it is their responsibility to ensure that the annual financial statements fairly present the state of affairs of
the group as at the end of the financial year and the results of its operations and cash flows for the period then ended in
conformity with international financial reporting standards the external auditors are engaged to express an
independent opinion on the annual financial statements

the annual financial statements are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs
and are presented in terms of the disclosure requirements as set out in the saica financial reporting guides as issued
by the accounting practices committee and financial reporting pronouncements as issued by the financial reporting
standards council the jse listings requirements and the requirements of the companies act 2008 the annual financial
statements are based upon appropriate accounting policies consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent
judgements and estimates

the directors acknowledge that they are ultimately responsible for the system of internal financial control established by
the group and place considerable importance on maintaining a strong control environment to enable the directors to
meet these responsibilities the board of directors sets standards for internal control aimed at reducing the risk of error
or loss in a cost effective manner the standards include the proper delegation of responsibilities within a clearly defined
framework effective accounting procedures and adequate segregation of duties to ensure an acceptable level of risk these
controls are monitored throughout the group and all employees are required to maintain the highest ethical
standards in ensuring the groups business is conducted in a manner that in all reasonable circumstances is above reproach
the focus of risk management in the group is on identifying assessing managing and monitoring all known forms of
risk across the group while operating risk cannot be fully eliminated the group endeavours to minimise it by ensuring
that appropriate infrastructure controls systems and ethical behaviour are applied and managed within predetermined
procedures and constraints

the directors are of the opinion based on the information and explanations given by management that the system of
internal control provides reasonable assurance that the financial records may be relied on for the preparation of the annual
financial statements however any system of internal financial control can provide only reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss

the directors have reviewed the groups cash flow forecast for the next 12 months and in the light of this review and
the current financial position they are satisfied that the group has or has access to adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future the going concern basis has therefore been adopted in preparing the
annual financial statements

the external auditors are responsible for independently auditing and reporting on the groups annual financial
statements the summary consolidated annual financial statements have been examined by the groups external auditors
and their report is presented on page 98

the summary consolidated annual financial statements set out on pages 84 to 128 which have been prepared on the
going concern basis were approved by the board of directors on 14 july 2016 and were signed on its behalf by

                                                                                                                                   2016

            for the 2016 financial year core headline earnings and core headline earnings per share constituted additional disclosure due to the number
            of adjustments as shown above

year under review

in the interim results to 30 september 2015 dawn reported significant progress in the implementation of its turnaround strategy
however the second half of the financial year was severely impacted by a sharp economic slowdown and a lag in government spend on
water projects which resulted in losses in a number of businesses

grohe dawn watertech gdw in which dawn holds a minority 49 stake was also impacted by delayed approval of working capital
funding which disrupted the supply chain and had an impact on earnings at the associate company investment level as well as on the
building trading segment of dawn gdws largest customer

lower resource prices foreign exchange volatility and scarcity and political instability also impacted adversely on dawns rest of africa
business

thus group sales came under severe pressure in the second half the management team responded by lowering prices to maintain
historical volumes this only served to exacerbate the impact of the reduction in sales by also reducing gross margins although the
groups operating expenses were trimmed back aggressively it has a high fixed cost base which does not allow further cost reductions in
the shortterm group operating margin therefore decreased from 35 in h1 f2016 to a loss for f2016 the subsidiary businesses which
moved into losses were sangio incledon promax kitchen fittings dawn africa and dpi international as well as associates gdw and some
africa operations total losses after tax including gdw amounted to r1300 million based on historical results and future expectations of
investments the board has decided to make significant impairments to the carrying value of these investments

these losses continued into the first quarter of f2017 under the guidance of new management the group prioritised plans to halt the
losses move back into profit and bring working capital back to normal levels a plan to achieve this was approved by the executive
committee and the board of directors at the end of june 2016 and significant progress toward these goals is expected during the second
quarter of f2017

earnings for f2016 are therefore as follows
	an operating loss before tax interest impairments and derecognitions of r239 million nine months f2015 a loss of r801 million
   a headline loss per share of 656 cents nine months f2015 a headline loss of 281 cents per share and
   a loss per share of 3183 cents nine months f2015 loss per share of 2021 cents

income statement

restatement 1

an addendum to the existing lease agreement on the germiston distribution centre in 2009 was not disclosed to the board as a
result the lease liability had to be restated based on a 15year lease at an escalation of 8 per annum ending in december 2023
payments under the operating lease are recognised as expenses on a straightline basis over the lease term the expense treatment
therefore does not reflect the cash profile of the lease the difference between the cash and the expense is accounted for as a lease
liability the lease liability of r858 million as at 31 march 2016 will reduce during the remaining period of the lease to rnil these
entries do not affect dawns historical or future cash flow and any increases or reduction in the lease liability will not impact on
dawns cash flow

                  the stepup of dawns interest from a 51 joint venture to a 90 subsidiary triggered new intangible assets which had
                  to be recognised these intangible assets were impaired on the basis that the consideration paid did not support the
                  discounted cash flows of the business future expectations relating to business performance were also not materially
                  different from the prior year where an impairment of the investment in joint venture was accounted for the suwa
                  acquisition was forced due to the fact that there was a contractual obligation to exit out of nigeria as well as to settle a
                  guarantee provided by dawn before it could exit intangible assets to the value of r295 million were impaired in the ast
                  group and r42 million on suwa a subsidiary in the ast group

                  promax was acquired to enhance and complement the wholesale of welding equipment already established in the
                  wholesale distribution model the promax impairment was due to the short delivery against an earnout target not being
                  achieved as well as a business partner who did not share dawns views in running the business the business partner
                  subsequently absconded and on further consequential investigations certain anomalies were uncovered which
                  necessitated the impairment
                  intangible assets to the value of r456 million were impaired at sangio pipe proprietary limited sangio pipe a company
                  in the infrastructure segment consisting of r190 million of goodwill r113 million of trademarks and r154 million of
                  customer relationships the additional 51 in sangio pipe a high density polyethylene hdpe manufacturer was acquired
                  to complement the existing pvc and hdpe pipe ranges in the dawn group the impairment arose due to the slowdown in
                  the economy and specifically in the mining industry as well as a slowdown in exports

                  the fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the statement of
                  financial position date a market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange
                  dealer broker industry group pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly
                  occurring market transactions on an arms length basis the quoted market price used for financial assets held by the group
                  is the current bid price these type of instruments are included in level 1 dawn carries no level 1 financial instruments

                  the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example overthecounter derivatives is
                  determined by using valuation techniques these valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where
      2016
                  it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates if all significant inputs required to fair value an
                  instrument are observable the instrument is included in level 2 if one or more of the significant inputs is not based on
                  observable market data the instrument is included in level 3

7   derivative financial instruments continued
     specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include

         quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments

         the fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on
          observable yield curves

         the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the statement of
          financial position date with the resulting value discounted back to present value

         other techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial
          instruments

     all of the resulting fair value estimates are included in level 2

   explanatory note
   in terms of section 668 and section 669 of the companies act a company may pay remuneration to directors
   for their services as directors unless otherwise provided by the memorandum of incorporation and on approval of
   shareholders by way of a special resolution executive directors are not specifically remunerated for their services as
   directors but as employees of the company and as such the resolution as included in the notice requests approval of the
   remuneration paid to nonexecutive directors for their services as directors of the company based on a benchmarking
   exercise performed by pricewaterhousecoopers inc for similar companies dawns nonexecutive directors are
   remunerated substantially below market average taking into account the current financial position that dawn is in
   and the extra commitment and input required from the nonexecutive directors it is essential in these circumstances
   that dawn retains or attracts nonexecutive directors with the necessary experience and credentials the proposal by
   the remuneration committee is therefore that the fees for nonexecutive directors be aligned to the market average
   furthermore an additional fee for the lead independent director is proposed this is necessitated at this time and the
   requirement will cease by the end of march 2017 further information is outlined in the report of the remuneration
   committee on page 75 of the integrated report
