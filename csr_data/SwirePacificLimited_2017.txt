1 totals may not be the exact sum of numbers shown here due to rounding
2 for the cathay pacific group only co₂ emissions for aviation turbine fuel are reported as there is no scientific consensus on the global warming effect of other emissions cathay pacific monitors
developments in these areas of atmospheric science including studies from the uks omega aviation and environment project and the institute of atmospheric physics at the german aerospace
centre
3 virtually all water consumption by the swire pacific group is withdrawn from municipal water supplies provided by local water supply authorities swire properties buildings have installed
rainwater catching facilities but the amount of rainwater caught is insignificant in relation to the groups total water consumption
4 this figure excludes onhire vessel fuel consumption as this belong to scope 3 as defined by the greenhouse gas protocol
