 credibility through third party certification
 one of smurfit kappas key focus areas is to assure
 customers that the fibres used in our packaging
 solutions come from sustainable sources currently the
 most credible way to do this is to participate in forest
 management and related chain of custody certification
 we take thirdparty certification very seriously and
 examine it closely
 forest management and chain of                    quality assurance

 in commercial forests and plantations            pursuing certification in simple terms
 then follow up the material trail through         third party involvement eliminates the
 documentation to its origin however             possibility of corruption in a system and

smurfit kappa reduces its co2 emissions through a systematic approach that includes
increasing resource efficiency through implementation of best practices in energy
production in its paper mills with correct technologies in place we can reach an
energy efficiency of over 85 by for example installing combined heat and power
chp plants in our mills

recovered paper              recovered paper refers to used paper and board separately collected and classified for the purpose of recycling which is then
                             used as raw material in the manufacture of new paper and paperboard
recovery                     recovery refers to extracting selected materials for a specific use in the paper industry this means recovery of fibres in
                             recycled paper or the recovery of energy value in the final stage of the material life cycle
recycling                    converting material into new materials and products in the paper industry this refers to converting recovered fibres back to
                             paper and finding new uses for other raw materials produced alongside recovered paper instead of sending them to landfill
reduction                    this can either mean finding the most materially efficient ways to use raw materials or replacing a more harmful raw material
                             with a less harmful one and thus reducing its harmful impact
renewing                     using renewable raw materials in a sustainable manner and maintaining the natural ability of the material to be renewed
reuse                        using a product or raw material again without changing its form in between
