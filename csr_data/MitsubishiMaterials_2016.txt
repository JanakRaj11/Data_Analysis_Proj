                 escrap contains high concentrations of valuable metals such as gold silver copper
                 and palladium and is being generated in increasingly large quantities all over the world
                 we have continued to expand escrap recycling operations at our metals company and
                 have set ourselves the longterm target of becoming the worlds number one processor of
                 escrap
                    we completed a second escrap center at the naoshima smelter  refinery in april
                 2016 as a result of enhancements of escrap receiving sampling analyzing and process
                 ing equipment the escrap receiving and processing capacity of naoshima smelter 
                 refinery is now approximately 110000 tons per year combined with onahama smelting               second escrap center
                  refining co ltd as a group we are now receiving and processing escrap on a world
                 leading scale at around 140000 tons per year
                    in june 2016 we also established mm metal recycling bv as a new company in the
                 netherlands through joint investment between ourselves 90 and hanwa co ltd
                 10 we will be working to expand the collection of escrap from the european region
                 which is one of the largest sources of escrap                                                   rendering of the new companys escrap center

                 our long history of generating hydroelectric power dates back to 1898 when the nagata
                 hydroelectric plant in what is now kazuno akita prefecture began supplying power
                 to osarizawa mine and homes in the local area we continued to expand our power
                 plant operations after that point in line with japans economic growth and today have
                 six power plants in kazuno and kitaakita akita prefecture as these power plants are
                 getting older however we are working to upgrade them with new facilities we started
                 with nagata hydroelectric plant and komatagawa no4 hydroelectric plant both of which
                 went back online in 2015 as a result of these upgrades we have increased our maximum
                 output from 600kw to 721kw at nagata hydroelectric plant and from 6500kw to
                 6808kw at the komatagawa no4 hydroelectric plant we have also been able to further
                 stabilize operations and revenues
                                                                                                                   komatagawa no4 hydroelectric plant

                 around 106 million units of flat screen televisions were recycled at all the japanese home
                 appliance recycling plants in the fiscal year 2016 there will be even greater movement
                 of replacement for televisions which were purchased under the governments ecopoints
                 scheme or to match with the end of terrestrial analog broadcasting around 2020 the
                 demand for recycling is expected to increase sevenfold up to nearly 7 million units per
                 year to effectively process such significantly increased flat screen televisions we have
                 developed our own automatic screwremoving device we have already installed the
                 device and started operation in our three recycling plants three out of five plants the
                 cameras in the device detect locations of screws which are fixed in the rear cover and
                 printed circuit board while the conveyor belt of the device is carrying flat screen televisions
                 continuously and then robots of the device automatically remove the detected screws
                 this device helps us to recycle flat screen televisions safely and efficiently so we can
                 increase our capacity of processing to meet the mass disposal of flat screen televisions in       automatic screwremoving device for flat screen televisions
                 the near future

                  smelting and cement recycling system
                  to help create a recyclingoriented society we effectively reuse byproducts from our nonferrous smelting facilities as raw
                  materials for our cement manufacturing facilities and vice versa we are also using this system which enables us to recycle

   harnessing forest capabilities more effectively
   forests have a wide range of capabilities from preserving biodiversity and absorbing co2 to producing timber as a sustainable resource as a society
   we continue to place greater expectations on forests with every passing year that is why setting targets is an essential part of forest management
   so that we can map out a vision for forests in the future in terms of which capabilities to prioritize
      in an effort to ensure more balanced forest management based on peoples needs mitsubishi materials real estate corp holds its own monthly
   workshops and bimonthly regular meetings with mitsubishi materials in order to further debate in this area and dedicates itself to achieving our
   vision for forests in the future on a daily basis
      as an example of one priority initiative we are currently working on zoning activities at each of our forests zoning is an approach based on
   clearly marking out areas according to their expected capabilities and then implementing management policies accordingly for each zone in the inter
   ests of effective forest management specifically the aim is to focus on timber production in zones where the trees have the strongest growth poten
   tial whilst also enhancing the forests multifunctional capabilities zones with features such as ridges and streams meanwhile are spared from logging
   as a rule with an emphasis
   on preserving biodiversity
   instead setting targets in
   line with the characteristics
   of each zone in this way is

   multifunctional capabilities
   that forests have to offer

external environment along the way looking back at the companys history there            materials departments and tackling the issue of conflict minerals as well as
has been a clear shift from 1 coal and mineral mining to 2 smelting cement           operating a set of procurement standards for copper ore given that sustainable
cemented carbide tools and electronic materials and again to 3 expanding                 production and consumption is also a target under the sdgs however the
operations such as taking in waste products and processing escrap given that              company will be expected to come up with more effective and transparent
this report is based on detailed analysis for materiality i would like to offer my         initiatives in the future i would like to know more about how suppliers have
comments from the perspective of how well mitsubishi materials responds to the              reacted to guidelines being introduced for example or what sort of impact the
needs of the times                                                                         companys activities have had on local communities in mining areas
    according to a report published by the united nations environment program                  actions at each stage 1 2 and 3 actually depend on people establishing
metal ore mining increased at an annual rate of 28 from 1970 to 2010 with                a direction on the other hand is down to the companys culture and climate
nonmetallic minerals such as limestone increasing at a rate of 4 during the               when i visited the yokkaichi plant which has experienced a serious accident i
same period as these figures significantly exceed the rate of population growth            saw that there were mechanisms in place to prevent similar accidents from

shifting towards stage 3 should be regarded as an urgent priority in terms of             also on hand to provide management with harsh but necessary criticisms via

become a top economic priority in europe                                                   the future i would like to see the lessons learnt from the accident at the yokkaichi
    in this respect mitsubishi materials is playing a crucial role in creating a           plant being taken equally seriously at other divisions and inhouse companies
recyclingoriented society thanks to its wideranging recycling activities in areas        and incorporated into the companys operations in general rather than focusing
such as waste products municipal waste incineration nonferrous scrap rare               on the accidents specific to the yokkaichi plant
metals fluorine resources home appliances and aluminum beverage cans as well                 in terms of the presidents emphasis on organizational cultural reform and
as the doubleloop recycling system based on the metals and cement businesses              human resource development meanwhile i think that the wakuwaku project
which it has developed as one of the few companies in the world as the report              covered in the special feature is a unique human resource development program
states that mitsubishi materials is processing escrap containing precious metals           that will create a greater sense of unity in the workplace and improve employee
on a worldleading scale the company can be expected to play a symbolic role as            motivation as part of important behind the scenes jobs supplying parts and
a worldwide leader in resource recycling                                                   materials on a btob basis i hope to see this being rolled out companywide in the
    in terms of manufacturing useful products under stage 2 the company is               future not just at the advanced materials  tools company
looking beyond materials that are traditionally used in large quantities as part of             given the nature of mitsubishi materials business there is considerable
social infrastructure such as cement and copper wire at its gifu plant which i           overlap between the company s business strategy and esg issues in
visited this year the company is also providing cemented carbide tools for use in          environmental and social areas although the report sets out longterm targets
aircraft manufacturing and stateoftheart medical applications as well as small          for environmental management the company could also make a commitment
parts such as the drilling bit for micronlevel drills i learnt that items such as these   both internally and externally to striking a broader balance between economic
are actually essential to the evolution of industry                                        and social value by integrating the targets with kpi in medium to longterm
    there are a wide range of issues affecting the whole of humankind                       management strategies for instance
meanwhile including the growing divide between the rich and poor human
