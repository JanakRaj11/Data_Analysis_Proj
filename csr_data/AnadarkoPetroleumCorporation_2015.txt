abbs greatest impact in sustainability lies in the increased productivity and reduced environmental
impact that our products systems and services help our customers to achieve however we are
also doing a lot within our own operations to improve our sustainability
                                                                                                            wwwabbcomsustainability
following are some examples from just one of our manufacturing facilities our small power
transformer plant in south boston va beginning in 2013 the plant undertook an analysis to
identify projects that would not only improve sustainability but also offer cost savings

energy efficiency
one of the most obvious improvement areas was lighting the 120000squarefoot main building
was upgraded from conventional metal halide lighting to led in 2013 the project included the
addition of smart lighting controls and cost 425000 energy savings combined with lower
maintenance costs and improved productivity were estimated at 300000 per year so weve
                                                                                                           from lighting to waste
already made back our initial investment
                                                                                                         reduction one plant shows
similarly the paint line at the plant was using a flow coat process that last year was replaced
with a spray and powder coat process annual savings from this project are estimated at more              that sustainability has a
than half a million dollars on an investment of 800000
                                                                                                               business case
finally we applied some of our own energysaving technology in the form of highefficiency
motors along with drives switchgear and controls to a slitter machine used in a fabrication
process combined annual savings are expected to be more than 100000 but the project will
also cut carbon dioxide emissions by 375 metric tons per year

waste reduction
south boston historically has generated around 180 tons of wood pallet waste per year the wood
was cut up on site and then sent to landfills in 2014 abb began sending the wood to a grinding
facility for use either as wood mulch or as fuel for a nearby biomassfired power plant clearly this
was a win from an environmental perspective but it also eliminated 20000 per year in avoided
disposal fees and increased productivity

looking ahead
as a transformer plant operating since the 1960s there remain traces of polychlorinated biphenyls
pcbs onsite from historical operations prior to abb although they are far below any regulatory
threshold abb has taken steps to mitigate the risk of outflow of pcbs from the site with a
250000 project to reconstruct the storm water channel

the improvements made at south boston are indicative of how abb lives our values and walks
the talk with regard to sustainability

                                                  success for bayer is more than just profitable economic growth it also means improving the

                                                  matters in order to overcome some of the great challenges of our time

                                                  an expected world population of more than 9 billion people by 2050 also requires increasing
                                                  agricultural production by approximately 60 percent to tackle this challenge bayer not only
                                                  offers innovative seed and crop protection products but also education to improve agricultural

                                                  with conventional cultivation methods this uses 20 percent less water increases yields by
                                                  10 percent and reduces the emission of the greenhouse gas methane by up to 30 percent

                                                  sustainability thus makes economic sense for our company it does not play an isolated role at
                                                  bayer but forms an integral part of our corporate strategy and moreover sustainability is close

view we seek to preserve and protect the 290 billion in assets our investors have entrusted
us to manage which includes a portfolio of companies across industries and geographies that
employs more than 618000 people globally a footprint of this scope enables us to think about
sustainability from multiple vantage points as no onesizefitsall approach will suffice as we
work with management across our portfolio to create more efficient and sustainable companies                wwwblackstonecom

we dont make an initial investment unless we see an opportunity for transformative intervention
 a process of evaluation that begins when we first look at a potential transaction our portfolio
operations team partners with company management to leverage decades of experience
identifying improvements that can be made early in our ownership period to have a meaningful
impact as soon as possible for example shortly after closing the firms largest acquisition last
year manufacturer gates global we helped establish an initiative that supports the reduction of      blackstones approach to
energy costs and associated environmental impacts often our work in this area is as much about
improving existing processes as it is about starting something new and at gates were helping        sustainability is rooted in

several years ago we set a target of zero growth by 2017 in greenhouse gas ghg emissions
water use hazardous waste generation and solid waste sent to landfills  all as our commercial
production rates increase by 50 percent it is a very big goal reaching it means designing new
buildings to leadership in energy and environmental design leed standards and supporting
hundreds of teams across the company who spearhead their own environmental projects because
they are inspired to build something better for the communities in which we work and live

sustainability has become a critical business issue and in this environment competitive
advantage flows to companies that know how to do more with less based on insights from our
annual sustainability study with mit sloan management review today 65 percent of executives
say that sustainability is on their top management agenda  up from just 46 percent in 2010

despite the broad management consensus on sustainabilitys importance our 2014 study with
                                                                                                               wwwbcgcom
mit sloan and the united nations un global compact found that many companies struggle
to integrate sustainability into their strategies and operations for instance 86 percent believe
that their boards should play a strong role in their companies sustainability efforts but only
42 percent report that their boards actually do

to help elevate sustainability on the strategic agenda we are privileged to partner with the un
global compact on the global compact board programme the program seeks to enable boards
                                                                                                       sustainability has become

though bcgs broadest contribution to sustainability is through our work with commercial clients
around the world were also proud of our longstanding partnership with the wwf in hong kong
we helped develop a plan to move wwfs low carbon manufacturing programme from a budget
deficit to a financially selfsustaining position freeing up resources for greater impact and in
2014 we joined with wwf to evaluate the health of the baltic sea identifying opportunities to
add 550000 jobs and 32 billion in economic value to the region by 2030

lastly we recognize that the size and nature of our business creates an environmental impact
over the last several years weve implemented five global bcg green initiatives focused on video

impact

approaches to what many nations have embraced as a solution to meet these objectives  21st

21st century coal mining operations demand an intense focus on operational excellence
everything matters  from a commitment to safety to restoring the land for generations to
follow

safety is a core value and way of life at peabody and is supported by our systems standards
training and risk management programs we also work to continually improve productivity and
resource recovery through enhanced mining and extraction methods and are focused on land
                                                                                                          the united states is proof

the ability to maximize recovery of resources is also important in modern mining production
both above and below ground is optimized using multiple mining methods and peabody typically               controls at coalfueled
recovers 90 to 96 percent of mined coal seams in opencut mining
                                                                                                            plants can drive major
energy access
we believe that energy poverty is one of the worlds biggest human and environmental crises             environmental improvements
energy is essential to a better longer life bringing improvements in health and longevity and
in economic growth the lack of electricity prevents refrigeration of medicines and vaccines
                                                                                                           since 1970 coal used for
sterilization of medical tools and sanitization of water                                               electricity has increased more
we believe that coal is one of the keys to increasing access to electricity and improving human health    than 170 percent as gdp
and welfare not only does energy use increase longevity but it also drives global economic growth
there is a clear correlation between expanding coal use and growing economies since 1970 coal use      more than doubled and key
has increased 353 percent with a similar increase in world gross domestic product gdp
                                                                                                          emissions per kilowatt hour
clean coal solutions
the worlds environmental goals  including clean water electricity for health and lower                   decreased 90 percent
carbon emissions  can be met through todays advanced coal technology the united states is
proof that todays highefficiency controls at coalfueled plants can drive major environmental
improvements since 1970 coal used for electricity has increased more than 170 percent as gdp
more than doubled and key emissions per kilowatt hour decreased 90 percent

all of us share the same basic desire to make the world cleaner healthier and more energy secure
and while we need all forms of energy to address global energy needs 21st century coal is
essential to increasing access to lowcost electricity while using todays advanced technologies
to improve emissions

coal is the only affordable fuel at scale to meet global energy demands and we are proud to play
an essential role in expanding energy access enabling longer healthier lives and strengthening
economies around the world

lighting systems in our plants replacing older equipment and preventing heat losses at our             effect later in the decade
facilities by improving productivity and operational efficiency and using significantly less energy
to manufacture our products over this same time period tennecos revenues have grown from
46 to 84 billion without a significant increase in overall energy use

while implementing these relatively small  but important  incremental improvements we
also have made more dramatic changes for example our hosur india plant recently cut ghg
emissions by 90 percent and overall energy costs by 62 percent by converting to electricity
generated by wind power

looking to the future we see only growing demand for technologies that provide cleaner and
safer operation of vehicles and other power sources tenneco will continue to create the advanced
products and systems that meet those needs while promoting sustainability both in our factories
and in the communities we serve

                                                   semiconductor chips need to operate by about 8 percent on average  every year when you
                                                   add up the savings and multiply it by billions of chips the difference weve been able to make for
