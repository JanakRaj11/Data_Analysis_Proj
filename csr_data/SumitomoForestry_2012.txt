  purpose of this report


the purpose of this report is to inform a wide range of stakeholders about the sumitomo forestry groups
policies and initiatives aimed at realizing a sustainable society

sumitomo forestry considers that it is essential to clarify the important issues it faces accordingly the
company has formulated four material issues to address based on the results of a survey given to its
stakeholders in fiscal 2007 since fiscal 2008 sumitomo forestry gives priority to these four material issues
in its initiatives the results of which are presented in this report

the companys principal method of informing stakeholders about its csr activities is the csr report on its
website aiming to meet stakeholders diverse needs the report also discloses highly specialized content

in addition to the csr report on its website the company provides content on the environment and forests on
its csr information website in order to effectively convey to its various stakeholders the information that will
be of most interest to them based on their differing perspectives it also actively uses its corporate profile
annual report and other media to enhance its communication with stakeholders

  internal link csr report 2012 httpsfcjpenglishinformationkankyoindexhtml

the csr report is no longer distributed as a brochure and is only available on the companys website
however pdfs of the report are publicly available for download and printing

  internal link pdf downloads  back issues httpsfcjpenglishinformationkankyopdfindexhtml
  link to related website csr httpsfcjpenglishcsrindexhtml

from this report onwards information will be presented in three sectionspolicy  plans results and future
plansin order to more accurately convey to stakeholders how the group is continuously improving its
activities through employing the pdca plandocheck correctiveaction management method however the
future plans section will not be included if only the same initiatives from the previous fiscal year are being
continued



     those aspects of sumitomo forestry groups efforts and its corporate spirit are repeatedly
     stressed and tend to stand out while other parts involving data and materials based on facts
     remain hidden therefore i think that there are probably a lot of people who find it hard to read in
     this regard customer



  reliability of report content


the respective departments of sumitomo forestry group have endeavored to ensure accuracy by using
appropriate measurement and data collection methods for the initiatives and results reported in the report
these methods are also disclosed when relevant sumitomo forestry group has solicited thirdparty opinions
from external specialists to impartially assess the appropriateness of the reports content and the companys
csr activities

 proactiv ely tackling the challenges of the housing industry


last year saw not only the occurrence of the great east japan earthquake but also a powerful typhoon
which struck the japanese islands in september the fury of nature including earthquakes and flooding also
inflicted enormous damage on peoples lives and regional areas around the world i would like to express my
heartfelt condolences to all those who were affected by these natural disasters

we continue to actively participate in the recovery efforts following the earthquake and have been working
tirelessly with our colleagues in the housing industry to construct emergency housing there is a greater need
than ever for safe and secure living environments that can also conserve energy and the earthquake has
acutely reminded us that homes form the basis both for peoples lives and social stability i am convinced that
the groups mission is to develop homes that are even more resilient to natural disasters as well as being
more secure and comfortable to live in the earthquake highlighted issues including a lack of genuinely
antiseismic housing the liquefaction of housing foundations and shortages of building materials when supply
chains are disrupted however the housing industry as a whole is now reevaluating these issues and pushing
forward to develop all possible countermeasures




                                                       5                           sumitomo forestry csr report 2012

 w orking to realize prosperous and sustainable housing and lifestyles


we are having to respond not only to peoples increasingly diverse needs for their living environments but
also to changes in social conditions including the enactment of new environmental regulations and changes in
population dynamics in march 2010 for example japan revised its basic plan for housing under the basic
act for housing

the sumitomo forestry group is utilizing all of its available resources to construct a wide range of highquality
wooden homes that are antiseismic energy conserving and longlasting allowing people to live comfortably in
them for many years japan will soon have to confront the issue of how the nation can effectively utilize its
existing stock of houses homes can be transformed by ensuring antiseismic and providing a comfortable living
environment and in this regard we are also actively involved in the remodeling and renovation market
overseas we are identifying the needs of each region and offering our customers new home lifestyles by
combining the wooden construction technologies and housing culture we have nurtured in japan



 emboldened by the power of forests and the sumitomo sprit we are aiming to be the
 worlds leading forestry company


forests are a renewable natural resource and have an important function in the global environment in that they
absorb and sequester carbon dioxide sumitomo forestry has consistently carried out our sustainable forestry

survived the tsunami bringing a ray of hope to people in the devastated area we also launched a particle
board manufacturing operation in vietnam employing technology to utilize timber that was previously discarded

in society of the excellence of wood as a resource and the crucial importance of forests in turn this
recognition will help us to achieve sustainable management and further enhance our corporate value

  cooperating with stakeholders based on a global v ision and local action


the sumitomo forestry groups business field is closely linked to wood it encompasses a wide range of
operations including reforestation forestry management building materials manufacturing housing distribution
of timber and building materials and wood biomass which we are developing in 13 countries and 40 regions
worldwide the world shares many common problems not least environmental issues but peoples homes and
lifestyles differ according to the climate and culture of each region in developing our operations it is vital that
we combine a global perspective with an understanding of how to conduct activities at the local level with this
goal in mind on april 1 2012 we restructured our business in order to maximize our management resources
and quickly address shifts in the fastchanging global environment our organization is made up of employees
with a common mission who carry out their daily duties with enthusiasm and a sense of vocation based on our
groupwide corporate philosophy and action guidelines i believe this enables us not only to contribute to
society but also to further enhance our corporate value

in 2007 the group formulated four material issues to be prioritized in our operations three of which are
closely connected with global environmental issues in fiscal 2011 we made the following progress with these
issues



                                                          7                            sumitomo forestry csr report 2012

1 providing timber products and materials from sustainable forests
    we achieved our fiscal 2012 target of 70 handling of timber from certified forests and plantation forests
    one year ahead of schedule
2 providing environmentally friendly homes
    we have been focusing our efforts on the sale of energyefficient homes for example in fiscal 2011 we
    increased the solar power installation rate to 36 an 8 increase over the previous fiscal year
3 promoting global warming countermeasures through our business
    we achieved a 56 reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared with the previous fiscal year in part
    thanks to our electricity saving measures

going forward the group will maintain concerted efforts to reduce emissions

our fourth material issue  promoting familycentric employee lifestyles  was designed so as to position
our employees as key stakeholders

in fiscal 2011 we conducted an employee satisfaction survey and provided all group employees with an
analysis of the survey results as well as a statement concerning the groups initiatives i myself have also
been communicating as much as possible with our employees on a daily basis

in fiscal 2012 we plan to launch the power for the future project a scheme in which employees can propose
new business ideas and we look forward to receiving a diverse range of ideas that transcend the boundaries
between different business units



 fulfilling the groups mission while focusing on the renewable natural resource that is
 wood


today there is a pressing need to build a sustainable society and in october 2010 the tenth conference of
parties to the convention on biological diversity cop 10 was held followed in june 2012 by the rio20
earth summit
the sumitomo forestry group is developing a wide range of home and lifestylerelated businesses with a
focus on timber which is a renewable and environmentally sound natural resource we have established a
sustainable business cycle of planting cultivating logging and replanting and we have developed
technologies that allow us to utilize each and every logged tree for the benefit of society in this sense the
sumitomo forestry group is uniquely positioned in being able to contribute to the global environment while also
further enhancing our corporate value and achieving growth

last fiscal year we formulated the sumitomo forestry group declaration of biodiversity in order to work even
harder to preserve biodiversity in the declaration longterm targets equivalent to the aichi targets which are
global targets set out at cop10 are further broken down to match actual business activities and we have
already launched initiatives toward achieving these targets these activities have been positively received
and in may 2012 the development bank of japan commended us as an advanced model business its highest
ranking for environmental performance this demonstrates that our initiatives promoting environmental
management are also helping to further enhance our economic value and this also serves as a great
encouragement for our future business activities

in recent years the business potential of forests and timber has widened with the creation of new added value
for wood as an environmental resource in areas such as carbon offset credits wood biomass power
generation and reforestation consulting services our responsibility to global society is to provide more
countries and regions with our expertise and technologies in order to support the development of local

 sumitomo forestrys business and csr


the history of sumitomo forestry dates back 320 years in japans meiji era sumitomo carried out a
largescale reforestation plan to restore the mountain forests of besshi in the shikoku region after pollution
from smelting and mining operations damaged the area planting as many as one million trees a year over
several years sumitomo succeeded in returning the mountains to their original lush condition the spirit behind
this preservation forestry allowed resources to be continually utilized in a pattern of logging followed by
planting and eventually led to the concept of sustainable forestry as a leading company in sustainability
sumitomo forestry is harnessing this spirit in its current operations

society has significantly changed in recent years as a result of the global environmental problems and social
issues that have emerged as a corporate group that conducts forest management and provides timber and
homes to customers both within japan and overseas sumitomo forestry group believes that it can play a
significant role in resolving these problems

 issues                       forests


there continues to be a decline in the worlds forests through illegal logging and excessive slashandburn
farming with approximately 52 million hectares 1 lost over the past ten years about 14 times the area of
japan in indonesia where sumitomo forestry is engaged in business activities there has been a reduction
in forests of around 5 million hectares 1 over the past ten years in order to continue using timber resources
into the future it is essential to use timber from forests in which sustainable forest management is carried out
and never to use timber derived from illegal logging

sumitomo forestry procures timber from around the world primarily southeast asia and europe in fiscal
2007 sumitomo forestry established its timber procurement philosophy  policy and action plan and has
promoted procurement of timber from forests that have been verified as legally compliant and appropriately
managed in fiscal 2009 verification of compliance by all direct overseas suppliers was completed as was the
domestic timber used for the housing divisions properties in fiscal 2011 in addition to legal compliance from
fiscal 2010 the company has promoted the use of environmentally friendly timber in accordance with its action
plan and is aiming to achieve the plans targets by fiscal 2012 as part of verification activities since fiscal
2012 it has also been carrying out csr surveys at all its suppliers to confirm that they are observing human
rights and maintaining appropriate labor conditions

in addition the economic development of regional society and enhancement of peoples living standards are
crucial elements in resolving issues such as forest degradation and reduction caused by illegal logging and
slashandburn farming in its overseas plantation forestry business the company has therefore promoted
social forestry together with local people going forward sumitomo forestry will continue promoting the use of
sustainable timber resources by expanding forest management in a way that contributes to environmental
protection and the development of regional society

 issues


given that the household sector accounts for 1441 of japans total co2 emissions additional energy
conservation is required in daily living in order to combat global warming it should be possible to reduce the
environmental impact of homes at the stages of construction occupation and demolition

as a supplier of around 9000 detached homes each year sumitomo forestry employs the ryouonbou design
method that utilize the power of nature solar power generation systems and fuel cell units at the same time
the company is developing its plantation forestry business to offset co2 emissions during the process from
tree logging for principal structural members through to construction while also developing life cycle carbon
minus lccm homes to reduce co2 emissions in the overall life cycle

sumitomo forestry believes that the proactive use of domestic timber not only in the principal structural
members but also in interior materials and furniture helps to preserve japanese forests and promotes
revitalization of the forest industry
sumitomo forestry is engaged in initiatives to preserve biodiversity including the planting of native trees in
domestic gardens as well as forests and is also advancing a wide range of housingrelated environmental
initiatives to help realize a society in which houses are used longterm across generations including extending
the life of houses and renovation

climate change resulting from global warming is a serious environmental problem facing the planet the durban
platform was adopted in 2011 at the 17th session of the conference of the parties cop17 at the united
nations framework convention on climate change unfccc it set the goal of holding down the increase in
the global average temperature to below 2 c or 15 c above preindustrial levels japan declared it would
not participate in the platform until the completion of the kyoto protocols second commitment period but it
seems inevitable it will have to reconsider the international commitment it made at a 2009 summit of cutting
total greenhouse gas emissions to 25 below 1990 levels by the year 2020

sumitomo forestry is emitting co2 in its offices and plants both inside and outside japan as well as during
activities including harvesting at mountain worksites and housing construction we promote energysaving
initiatives in offices and plants and the use of biomass to reduce co2 emissions in the companys business
activities in addition by the absorption and storage of co2 through our forest management we will help to
stem global warming


  policy  plans

sumitomo forestry is advancing initiatives aimed at achieving its new co2 reduction targets set in the
mediumterm environmental management plan formulated in december 2009


    new co2 emission volume reduction targets

    offices                           by fy2010 achieve a 12 reduction in overall emissions compared
                                        with fy2006 and maintain this level to fy2014

    subsidiaries in                   by fy2014 achieve an 8 reduction in emissions per unit sold
    manufacturing                      compared with fy2006 all group companies including offices
    businesses in japan1

    overseas subsidiaries  set targets for each plant in consideration of local laws and
    in manufacturing                    regulations including overall emissions emissions per unit sold andor
    businesses outside                  other targets as appropriate to each facility
    japan
     1 each plant set its own basic unit targets in addition reduction rates for combined co 2 emissions compared to fy2006 levels serve
        as a progress benchmark

  exchanging opinions on the groups plan for biodiv ersity and its longterm targets


on march 27 2012 the company held a stakeholder meeting to
ask the opinions of various ngos who are experts in the field of
biodiversity the meeting was part of the measures outlined in the
sumitomo forestry groups declaration of biodiversity action
guidelines and longterm targets that it formulated earlier in the
same month discussions took place on the three operational areas
of upstream midstream and downstream and the participants
engaged in a frank exchange of opinions over the course of the
two hourmeeting

  internal link policy and plans for biodiversity preservation p209


   opinions expressed at the meeting

upstream forestry business forest management
  the majority of the forests for which you have set targets in no3 of your individual longterm biodiversity
  targets p210 are in japan and i think you should set individual targets equally for domestic and overseas
  forests
  i think its wonderful that all the forests you own within japan are sgec certified i hope you are also aiming
  to acquire certification for your overseas forests
  i know you are carrying out initiatives to preserve the peat wetlands in your industrial tree plantations in the
  peat wetland forests of indonesia but i hope this is something you continue to pay the closest attention to
  i would like you to implement additional measures to preserve areas with degraded natural wood and to
  regenerate tropical forests




                                                          30                            sumitomo forestry csr report 2012

                                                                                               relations with stakeholders



midstream distribution business manufacturing business
  problems can occur even at certified forests so when you audit your business partners i think it is a good
  idea to confirm conditions while also listening to the voices of local people and members of ngos
  there is no law for privatesector organizations prohibiting the use of illegally logged timber so i want the
  forestry industry to form a group to pressure the government to create such a law
  even if we manage to return nature to its former state i hope that you will aim to achieve timber processing
  that has a low environmental footprint and that helps to preserve biodiversity
  while illegal logging of import of timber from overseas thus far been called into question we are now in the
  stage to question whether timber is being produced in a sustainable manner i would like you to more clearly
  communicate the message of proactively using timber produced with the next generation in mind


dow nstream other housingrelated businesses
  it is not easy for home owners to get information about the wood used in their homes so i would like you to
  have more communication with the home owner to provide them with information such as on the carbon
  footprint generated by the wood used for their home
  when developing land for housing i would like you to create a green zone plan and aim at preserving
  biodiversity in urban areas


the opinions of other stakeholders
  i think that in your declaration of biodiversity you should also mention your history of procuring timber from
  overseas
  i hope that you utilize the expertise you have accumulated in more than 300 years in your main forestry
  business and contribute to society by helping to realize a sustainable society
  no other company has created longterm biodiversity targets equivalent to the aichi targets so i hope you
  release the details of your targets for other companies to refer to and encourage them to follow your lead
  people are once again realizing the real value that forests have and the important roles they play for
  example their roles in trapping co2 preserving the soil system and recharging water sources i hope that
  you are aware of this new perspective as going forward i believe that a worldwide trend will be
  incorporating the value of natural capital into economic value

   responding to the opinions expressed

toshihiro komatsu general manager of the environmental management department
it has been extremely instructive to hear the opinions on biodiversity of so many people both from inside and
outside of the group and i would once again like to say thank you to all participants

at sumitomo forestry our business is deeply involved in forests timber and housing so todays discussions
have served to reinforce us with the importance of tackling the issue of biodiversity head on in order to help to
realize a sustainable society from now on we must broaden the scope of our vision of forests beyond trees
and other plants we need to consern all living organisms whether insects birds small animals large
mammals or even microorganisms and fungi and must reconsider the roles and relationship between all of
these living organisms in the natural environment namely the way that they mutually affect each other i feel
that doing this will provide us with an excellent opportunity to reevaluate their importance within our business
activities just as we are responding to the risk posed by climate change as one of the most important issues
of the environment all of the relevant divisions and departments within the sumitomo forestry group will
actively work as one to carry out initiatives to help preserve biodiversity as an inseparable pair element of the
environment

compliance counters one within the group and one outside it and has in place a framework to enable those
who contact the counters for advice or to report a compliance violation to consult the relevant regulations and
a user manual and to ensure that their interests will not be harmed

the group revised this manual in fiscal 2011 and it distributes it to all of its approximately 12500 group
employees including nonfull time employees and has been carrying out a range of initiatives to enable as
many people as possible to easily get advice and report a suspected violation these initiatives including using
the intranet to increased awareness about the compliance windows creating an email address only for use for
contacting the compliance counters and including in the user manual the photographs of the male and female
lawyers who are available for consultations on the external compliance counter as a result of these efforts in
fiscal 2011 the compliance counter was contacted 25 times a substantial increase on the 12 times during the
previous fiscal year

 rapidly comprehending and dealing with risks


in recent years the risks inherent in the companys business environment have expanded in both nature and
scope since 2002 the sumitomo forestry group has adopted a twohour rule system designed to rapidly and
accurately communicate information to management in the event of an emergency situation that may have a
serious impact on company management

by communicating information at an early stage the goal is to enable management to make a rapid and
precise first response to the situation also by gathering and analyzing data the company can disclose
information to its stakeholders in a timely and appropriate manner moreover it can take measures to prevent
incidents from occurring throughout the group by accumulating case studies

sequence of events for the twohour rule




  reconfirming risk items

based on the results of our 2008 survey conducted among 5742 employees the company created a risk map
and then linked this map to the activities of the risk management committee

in the march 2012 meeting of the risk management committee committee members reconfirmed and
reevaluated for their respective departments the degree of connection and the relative levels of importance of
the business risks defined in the risk management basic regulations and the securities report in addition
they reported on the measures that were carried out in fiscal 2011 to manage these risks the details of the
meetings were reported to the board of directors and were used in promoting risk management based on the
pdca cycle

the company discussed measures for disasters and bcp through the report titled disaster countermeasures
and verification of issues in the business continuity plan bcp the report was completed through survey to
the wishes and concerns that it discovered in its efforts to verify conditions on the ground immediately after
the march 11th 2011 earthquake and also in the results of survey it conducted for all employees in the tohoku
and kanto areas based on this document it instructed the risk management committee the great east
japan earthquake disaster restoration countermeasures division to examine possible response measures
and as a result of their recommendations we formulated our disaster countermeasures whose main goals are
to strengthening our ability to prevent and respond to disasters in order to protect lives and our assets they
constitute those measures to be carried out as standard throughout the group and include checking the levels
of safety at all of the groups business sites within japan implementing measures to ensure safety within work
sites such as to prevent work equipment falling over and selecting standardized disasterpreparation goods
and ensuring that at the least the minimal necessary level of these goods are stored at all sites the disaster
preparation goods to be stored at business sites in the tokyo metropolitan area osaka and nagoya should
be sufficient for three days of supplies for staff who are unable to return home due to a disaster and are
already being stores at all group business sites
in reformulating the bcp based on the issues extrapolated from the bcp training described below we
reviewed the plan to ensure that we would be able to carry out all of our priority operations in the event of a
disaster including paying employees who are at home or in other remote locations and paying the bills of our
business partners also while maintaining the highest levels of security we decided to move to a thinclient

  traffic safety


   policy  plans

group companies in japan including sumitomo forestry have a total fleet of around 6100 vehicles as of the
end of march 2012 for using for work and for commuting due to the size of this fleet it maintains the system
for managing these vehicles and provide employees with training so that it may eliminate as much traffic
accidents and violations as possible

   results

introducing the safe driving management system
the company has independently developed an integrated system to manage drivingrelated information such
as data on when employees last updated their driving licenses and any violations they have committed on car
inspection and on insurance in addition since 2007 every branch has been required to submit a monthly
report detailing its safe driving performance this system helps to prevent employees from forgetting to renew
their licenses car inspection certification or insurance moreover employees that use vehicles for work or for
commuting must immediately report traffic accidents and administrative measures to be taken against them
and once a year they must acquire and submit a certified driving record these regulations are playing a
useful role in preventing accidents from reoccurring and educating employees on the importance of safe
driving

adoption as an employee evaluation item
almost all of the vehicles managed by the company are used at branches of housing devision therefore
from fiscal 2011 we included among the evaluation item we use for branch managers an attempt on to what
extent they have been able to eliminate traffic accidents among their branchs employees

constructing a traffic safety management system for all group companies in japan
through the efforts of the compliance subcommittee in fiscal 2011 the group was able to standardize and
deploy througout group companies in japan a traffic safety management system which had already been in
use by some group companies this system includes regulations for the periodic updating of certified driving
records and on reporting traffic accidents and violations in addition the group identified which types of
accidents were occurring relatively frequently and created a poster showing practical steps that should be
taken to eliminate these accidents these posters have been distributed throughout the group


   future plans

going forward the company will further strengthen its traffic safety management to improve traffic safety
among its employees

 measures to restore housing in the disaster region

sendai miyagi prefecture and fukushima fukushima prefecture from april 2011 and in mito ibaraki
prefecture from august among the first tasks each center carried out were confirming whether or not the
customer was safe and the damage to their homes deciding on the level of danger and then making
arrangements for repair work in many cases it was the roof of the home that was damaged and the sheer
volume of repairs required could not be dealt with solely by local roofing repair shops the company therefore
recruited a large number of workers with the necessary skills from both sumitomo forestry group companies
and its cooperating companies throughout japan and dispatched them to the disaster region and with their
help it was able to press ahead with the repairs
going forward sumitomo forestry group will continue to focus its energies into the recovery such as through

     even more widely and increases the opportunities for contact with local people customer

 introducing a volunteer leav e program


to support its employees volunteering activities in may 2011 the company formulated a volunteer leave
program that allows employees a total of five days of leave a year for volunteer activities moreover the
company provided special support for volunteer activities for the great east japan earthquake setting a time
period within which it would pay the travel expenses and volunteer insurance premiums of employees who

 countermeasures against soil contamination


   policy  plans

soil contamination is difficult to discover because unseen contaminants can build up in places underground
over a wide area since there is the potential risk of soil contamination in various places at businesses that
buy and sell land rent and lease land and handle chemical substances the sumitomo forestry group has
standardized procedures for inspecting soil contamination prior to the purchase of new land in the spec home
business in addition to soil contamination countermeasures for land owned and managed by the company

management of guidebook on soil contamination risk countermeasures
in april 2010 the revised soil contamination countermeasures act was enacted increasing the frequency of
inspections and notifications for soil contamination a more diverse range of soil contamination problems are
likely to be discovered as a result in response sumitomo forestry created the guidebook on soil
contamination risk countermeasures in fiscal 2010 as a basic tool for countering the risk of soil
contamination and then released a revised version in april 2011 using this revised guidebook as a baseline
reference the sumitomo forestry group will take specific and effective action to address the risk of soil
contamination with any actions actually carried out being guided by the advice of designated investigative
organizations and government agencies with expert knowledge

voluntary soil cleanup at sumitomo forestry crest co ltds kashima plant
in fiscal 2008 sumitomo forestry crest co ltds kashima plant conducted a soil contamination survey on its
grounds as a voluntary initiative as a result the groundwater was found to slightly exceed the standards set
for volatile organic compound voc contamination
the plant cleaned up the soil in fiscal 2009 subsequent analysis of water samples in november 2011 found no
values exceeding the relevant standard and to be below the measurement threshold

 countermeasures against water pollution


  policy  plans

at facilities designated under the stipulations of the water pollution control law the company conducts
regular water quality surveys of discharged water and strictly manages quality in accordance with baseline
values


  results

the water pollution control law was revised in may 2010 establishing fines for improper recordkeeping of
pollution measurements for discharged water and others it also obligates companies to take measures
necessary to prevent water pollution caused by sewage and effluent the sumitomo forestry group has
thoroughly complied with this revised law and taken measures to address water pollution

 prev enting air pollution


  policy  plans

at facilities equipped with boilers which are compliant with the air pollution control law emissions and
concentrations of nox sox and soot and dust are regularly measured to ensure that strict compliance with
concentration standards is maintained
the revised air pollution control act of may 2010 established a system of fines for violations to the legal
requirement of recording and reporting of measurements of pollution levels such as the volume of smoke and
soot emitted in addition the revised law prescribed the legal requirements of those responsible for
implementing the measures required to control emissions of smoke and soot the sumitomo forestry group
is working to ensure compliance with the revised law and is implementing measures to prevent air pollution


  results

the iso14001 surveillance review conducted by an external certification body in fiscal 2011 indicated one
slight area of irregularity which was at the sumitomo forestry crests niihama plant a vent had become
blocked which resulted in dust concentrations in a waste wood boiler exceeding the legally designated level
despite this being recorded and reported there was a delay in reporting it to the supervising department
the company examined the measures implemented in response to the reviews indication and confirmed
whether or not their implementation was appropriate

     environmental impact assessment of japanese timber  a case study of the
     production of resources

     1 background
          timber has been established to be a highly environmentally sound material processing
          timber requires the consumption of a smaller amount of energy than its alternatives it is a
          renewable resource and the carbon dioxide that is emitted when it is incinerated is
          considered to be carbon neutral1 however there is only a limited number of inventory
          analyses of timber compared to its alternatives and there is a lack of reliable and established
          data therefore it is difficult to find detailed assessments that compare it to other materials
          when conducting an analysis of timber it is vital to have inventory data on logs but the
          situation in japan is that there are only a small number of research examples that can be
          used

3 results summary
   1    the majority of emissions generated in the production process of japanese timber are
         created during harvesting operations
   2    the volume of co2 emissions during harvesting operations may differ due to the effects
         of the work system the harvest material per area where harvest operations are
         conducted and the party conducting the operations
   3    it was calculated that 1m2 of japanese logs generates 101kg of co2 emissions
   4    it was calculated that the cost to society4 to produce 1m2 of japanese logs is in the
         range of 41 yen to 57 yen

the data suggests that a work system using high performance forestry machinery generates
more co2 emissions in the production of japanese logs than a work system that uses
conventional forestry machinery as a result in order to reduce the volume of co2 emissions
generated during harvesting operations it is important to improve the efficiency of the use of
high performance forestry machinery and to limit their fuel consumption

  contribution to expanding carbon stocks


    policy  plans

as trees grow they absorb co2 from the atmosphere and sequester it as carbon carbon stock trees
continue to store carbon even after being harvested and processed into products and co2 is only released
when the wooden materials are eventually incinerated
when mature trees are harvested and used as building materials the carbon sequestered in the trees is
stored for a long period of time this is the reason bedhind that building wooden houses almost means creating
forests in the city

the sumitomo forestry group promotes the use of timber from sustainably managed forests in the
construction of its highquality longlasting wood houses and for the wooden building materials it uses the
group also encourages the active use of timber mocca wood use integration operations 1 aim to expand
the applications of timber and promote its wider use which in turn increases timberbased carbon stocks and
helps to curb global warming

this situation in mind in april 2011 the company established the mocca wood use integration department
centered on the activities of this department the sumitomo forestry group is working to promote the use of
wood and thereby increase the carbon stock from timber and contribute to efforts to combat global warming

 climate change and sumitomo forestrys role


   policy  plans

climate change resulting from global warming is a serious environmental problem facing the planet the 17th
conference of the parties cop17 to the united nations framework convention on climate change adopted
the durban agreement with the goal of holding down the increase in global average temperature below 2 c or
15 c above preindustrial levels japan announced that it would not take part in the kyoto protocols second
commitment period but it seems to be inevitable that it will have to review its position following its international
commitment to meet the target established at the 2009 summit conference of the leading industrialized
nations of reducing total greenhouse gases by 25 compared to 1990 by 2020

given that the household sector accounts for about 1441 of japans total co2 emissions as a housing
provider the sumitomo forestry group has a major role to play in reducing co2 emissions that result from
home living it will make a positive contribution to the prevention of global warming by reducing co2 emissions
from its business activities while facilitating absorption or storage of co2 through proper forest management
and the promotion of group operations that encourage greater use of timber resources through the structural
application and incorporation of wood

   according to category indirect emissions




      the initiatives being conducted by sumitomo forestry for the risks anticipated from climate
      change are concrete and left a good impression on me student

 impact of climate change on the business


risks presented by climate change
 among those countries in which the sumitomo forestry group has business sites japan australia and new
 zealand are bound by the terms of the kyoto protocol which established greenhouse gas reduction targets
 to be achieved by fiscal 2012 as a result there is a risk that the regulations and tax systems could be
 tightened in these countries
 in july 2012 australia introduced a carbon pricing system carbonemissions tax and plans to move to an
 emissions trading system in 2015 china and indonesia are also both currently investigating introducing the
 same system which is expected to have an effect on the activities of companies with business sites in
 these countries
 given that sumitomo forestry uses wood as a natural raw material the depletion of timber resources or
 changes in forestland resulting from climate change could impact on the procurement of raw materials in
 addition the growth of companyowned forests could be affected by strong wind and heavy rain damage or
 changes in ecosystems resulting from climate change
 as demands to disclose greenhouse gas countermeasures further increase it may become necessary to
 gather wideranging information along the whole supply chain beyond the scope that is identifiable within the
 company in order to address these demands
 at sites in new zealand and elsewhere where hydroelectric power generation is used there is the risk that
 energy supply could be disrupted by climatic factors and the level of precipitation


opportunities presented by climate change
 using the kyoto mechanisms established by the kyoto protocol there is an opportunity to create credits
 through cdm projects
   link in this report cdm business using wood biomass power generation p232

 in housing construction sumitomo forestry aims to differentiate itself from its competitors through full
 compliance with energy conservation standards at the high level and also by supplying life cycle carbon
 minus lccm houses and other products with outstanding performance and equipment to generate and
 store energy
   link in this report developing of life cycle carbon minus lccm homes p171

 climate change generates opportunities such as promoting forest growth and developing untapped
 resources and the company believes this leads to new business opportunities including discovering new
 suppliers

  although there are differences between individual plants sumitomo forestry crest co ltd reduced its total
  co2 emissions yearonyear through initiatives to reduce the maximum instantaneous consumption of
  electricity at sites including its kashima plant at the same time it also improved its base unit performance
  from the previous year however its overall result fell well below the target as compared to the base year
  due to an increase in its production line compared to the base year and also because some of the
  komatsujima plants machinery was transferred to the kyushu plant following the sale of the komatsujima

 implementing power sav ing measures in response to the great east japan earthquake


   policy  plans

the sumitomo forestry group has been pushing ahead with a range of power saving initiatives not only in
response to the electricity shortages that followed the great east japan earthquake but also from the
perspective of reducing co2 emissions


   results

responding to the government order limiting the use of electricity
in july 2011 the government issued an order that obliged largescale users of electricity within the areas of
the tokyo electric power co inc or tohoku electric power co inc to reduce their electricity consumption by
15 compared to its maximum power usage in fiscal 2010 this applied to the tsukuba research institute and
sumitomo forestry crest co ltds kashima plant and through measures that included monitoring of peak
usage of electric power through a peak demand controller shifting the time when the equipments that used the
most electric power were used and rotating operations on production lines they succeeded in reducing
electricity usage by more than 15 compared to the peak usage on weekdays

implementing pow er saving measures throughout the country
responding to the power shortages that followed the great east japan earthquake from july to september
the company implemented power saving measures at all its sites throughout the country except for those in
the disaster region with the goal of reducing power consumption by at least 15 compared to the level in
fiscal 2010 specifically this involved strict management of lighting and air conditioning in work places to
ensure they were turned off when the area was not in use controls of lighting and airconditioner
temperatures and measures to ensure that all employees were aware of the importance of saving power
toward this the weekly email magazine included one or two methods of saving power while a review of work
styles was also conducted including adjusting working days and working times thanks to these efforts during
the 2011 summer period june to september the sumitomo forestry group was able to reduce the amount of
energy it used in the area under the jurisdiction of the tokyo electric power co inc and tohoku electric
power co inc by 243 compared to fiscal 2010 and by 63 in other areas these savings were
equivalent to 1706 tons of co2 emissions and moreover the company decided to continue to implement
these power saving measures after the summer of 2011

energy conservation in model homes and show rooms throughout japan
in response to the electricity shortages that followed the great east japan earthquake sumitomo forestry
has been turning off advertising boards and other types of external lighting at model homes tenant offices and
company offices roadside branches and has also introduced green curtains and solar power systems at
some locations
in addition in fiscal 2008 it launched a project to switch to environmentally sound lighting at its model homes
and showrooms throughout japan this has now been completed for the showrooms and is being carried out
sequentially at model homes since fiscal 2009 the company has maintained its policy of turning off lighting
during weekdays at these locations when there are no customers present

   future plans

at the present time it is anticipated that electricity demandsupply conditions will continue to be tight in the
near future based on this situation in order to reduce the maximum instantaneous consumption of electricity
from july 1 to september 30 in the summer of 2012 the sumitomo forestry group will implement power saving
measures at offices and business sites at all group companies the goal is to keep electricity usage to the
lowest possible level and achieve at least a nationwide 15 reduction in electricity consumption compared to
fiscal 2010 specifically this will entail continuing the initiatives launched in the summer of 2011 such as
ensuring that the lighting and air conditioning is always turned off within business sites when an area is not
being used adjusting workdays and times and farreaching reductions in the use of electrical equipment that
had a lower rate of reduction in the previous fiscal year improvements will also be implemented at those
group organizations and business sites that have not achieved sufficient power saving results up to the
present time
sumitomo forestry crest co ltd which is among the group of companies designated a largescale
electricity user will continue measures at its business sites to reduce electricity consumption with a particular
focus on the reduction of the maximum instantaneous consumption of electricity during the summer




     even though something might seem small making many small steps can have a big impact many
     households are saving money and energy and i think this will soon be the norm for offices too

eeca awards 20121 held in may 2012 it was highly evaluated for its achievement in reducing the amount of
wood for fuel and electricity it used through the introduction of two reforms the improvement of the combustion
efficiency of mdf2 combustion furnaces and the reduction of wood for fuel as well as the consumption of
electricity by installing a motor system that can save power these technologies were introduced in april 2010
and they have helped to achieve a reduction in co2 emissions of approximately 19 compared to the level
prior to their introduction in addition in comparison to the cost of installing these technologies of
approximately 45 million yen they save the company about 78 million yen each year in reduced energy costs
moreover the judges highly praised these projects for the contributions they make to the environment npil is
located on the south island new zealand which relies almost entirely on hydroelectric plants for its power
supply therefore it is prone to power shortages during the winter when rainfall levels are low but demand is
high due to the cold temperatures by reducing the amount of power that it consumes npil is helping to
reduce the burden on the regional energy supply

rationalizing and improving the efficiency of the distribution of home building materials
in fiscal 2007 the company reformed its home building materials logistics system instead of building materials
being sent individually from their manufacturer to the construction site it coordinated its nationwide network of
31 relay centers and constructed a logistics system for the consolidated shipment of various building materials
from multiple manufacturers thanks to this system in fiscal 2011 the company was able to reduce the co2
emissions by 162591 delivery vehicle trips compared to before the system was introduced equivalent to
about 1441tons of co2 in addition after the system was launched it began to reduce the number of delivery
vehicles used per facility moreover in order to further reduce co2 emissions generated when transporting
home building materials in fiscal 2010 it made full use of the expertise in logistics efficiency that it had
acquired up to that time and established home eco logistics co ltd which uses the relay centers to make
deliveries it is responsible for all the groups housing business logistic operations in japan and in addition it
provides outsourcer services for the sales logistics of materials manufacturers and deliveries to the
construction sites of other home manufacturers

  reducing energy use through the ryouonbou design concept


the ryouonbou design concept draws on the wisdom and techniques of japans traditional houses to
effectively take advantage of natures blessings and offer a housing style that enables people to live
comfortably while limiting energy consumption

the ryouonbou concept is based on three design principles for creating housing that is cool in the summer
and warm in the winter kaze no sekkei wind design taiyo no sekkei sun design and midori no sekkei
greenery design

research on a model house demonstrated that the ryouonbou design concept could reduce co2 emissions
during occupancy by about 401 compared to houses built to specifications mandated by 1992 energy
conservation standards

1 this figure only applies to emissions attributable to heating and cooling

case study plan for placement of greenery and channels for the airflow




deciduous trees grow thick with leaves in summer blocking out direct sunlight and creating a cool shady area
of foliage in winter the trees lose their leaves allowing the sunlight into the rooms




by planting trees on the north side of the house it is possible to make it cooler in summer this also has the
effect of protecting the house from the northerly winds




in addition to blocking out sunlight during summer the greenery also cools the air the use of climbing plants
such as bitter melon offers the added benefit of fresh produce




we recommend trees that suit the individual home and change appearance with the seasons as well as
bringing out the beauty of a home greenery also helps blend the building in with its surroundings




in addition to allowing rainwater to be absorbed in the earth a green parking space prevents the powerful rays
of the summer sun from being reflected back into the atmosphere thereby moderating increases in
temperature in the area around the home




strategically placed foliage in front of windows and other open areas restricts the view in the house from
outside and enhances privacy

a lawn effectively reduces the reflection of the heat of the sun back into the atmosphere leaf transpiration
whereby moisture evaporates from the grass helps moderate increases in temperature




by strategically placing trees according to prevailing wind direction it is possible to obstruct the cold northerly

initiatives including reducing the generation of waste reusing resources and recycling

in addition at the time of inputting raw materials it is necessary to eliminate redundant materials and use
components that generate a low amount of offcuts in order to reduce the volume of resources the company
also believes it is important to utilize recycled products in order to advance the recycling of resources
sumitomo forestry is working to complete the loop of recycling by using recyclable resources thoroughly
separating wastes at construction and demolition sites and promoting the use of recycled products




     i think its wonderful that your philosophy of using natural resources based on reuse repair and

  zero emissions initiativ es


in order to advance the recycling of resources the company first defines the zero emissions target to be
pursued and works to achieve this target


      definition of zero emissions

      the group will not simply incinerate or bury in landfills all of the industrial waste generated from
      its plants in japan and new housing construction sites



based on this definition the group will continue zero emissions activities at domestic manufacturing facilities
and initially aims to achieve zero emissions at new construction sites1 in the capital area by december 31
2012
the recycling rate at the end of fiscal 2011 was 893

  waste reduction at new housing construction sites


    policy  plans

sumitomo forestry identifies the volume of waste generated at new housing construction sites and works to
reduce this volume while also preventing inappropriate disposal the company is also working towards the
achievement of zero emissions by promoting the processing of industrial waste by utilizing interregion
recovery and recycling certification system1

 1 when manufacturers collect industrial waste across multiple prefectures this is a special system whereby approval for waste disposal is not required
    from each separate municipal government provided that the minister for the environment certifies compliance with certain strict criteria such as processing
    capacity even when the manufacturer outsources collectiontransportation intermediate treatment and final disposal

treatment of industrial waste utilizing interregion recovery and recycling certification system
on december 8 2010 sumitomo forestry obtained industrial waste certification from the minister of the
environment based on an interregion recovery and recycling certification system this system enables
companies designated by sumitomo forestry such as materials suppliers to be registered as persons
engaged in the collection or transportation of industrial waste so that approval for industrial waste treatment
is not required in relation to the collection and transportation of the companys waste this makes it possible
to collect industrial waste by utilizing specialist waste collectiontransportation vehicles and trucks returning to
base after having transported homebuilding materials to new construction sites and to consolidate waste
collection at collection centers registered in the interregion certification system
the consolidated waste is entrusted directly to treatment contractors that can process it with zero emissions
or is transported to inhouse facilities where highlevel separation can be carried out after sorting the waste
is entrusted directly to thirdparty recycling facilities or is sold at a profit

establishment of the capital area recycling center
  to achieve zero emissions at new construction sites waste needs to be sorted to the highest degree
  possible thinking that it would be effective to establish a specialist inhouse waste separation facility to
  carry out highlevel sorting of waste sumitomo established the capital area recycling center in kazo city
  saitama prefecture and it has been sequentially launching operations at this center since july 2012 the
  ultimate goal of the consolidation and separation of waste from housing construction in the capital area and
  its transportation to recycling centers is to achieve zero emissions in the tokyo metropolitan area by

validation w ith industrial waste traceability system
  in fiscal 2008 the housing division conducted a trial run of an industrial waste traceability system2 that
  uses ic chips to ascertain the actual output of waste from new housing construction sites in fiscal 2009
  this industrial waste traceability system was installed and operated at 10 branches including the six
  branches in the greater tokyo area mito kyoto shiga and kitakyushu the operational plans for the
  capital area recycling center have been drafted with reference to the data collected in this system
  this system will come to an end at the six branches in the tokyo area and mito along with the launch of the
  recycling center collection system utilizing interregion recovery and recycling certification system however
  operations were launched at the shinshu branch in february 2012 and it will also continue to operate in

initiatives to limit industrial waste from packaging materials
the group continues its efforts to limit the generation of industrial waste through the use of precut timber
reducing the amount of packaging materials used examples of efforts in this area include setting the
dimensions of the eaves to minimize the waste generated when producing precut timber for soffits the
underside of eaves and end cuts from materials used to finish the underside of the homes eaves in addition
the practicality and costs of precutting ceramic roof tiles sidings and panels for exterior reinforcement are
being investigated for future deployment


   future plans

sumitomo forestry will continue its efforts to increase its recycling rate at its business sites throughout japan
and achieve zero emissions through recycling at recycling centers that utilize the interregion recovery and
recycling certification system the companys capital area recycling center is working toward achieving
even finer separation of waste at the same time as developing materials recycled from inhouse production
and utilizing them in the construction of new houses

 conserv ation and sustainable use of timber resources


forests perform a variety of functions for the public good including erosion control and water control
cultivating water resources curbing global warming by absorbing co2 and preserving biodiversity for these
functions to work effectively proper forest management is crucial
the sumitomo forestry group believes that sustainable forest management is necessary to ensure that timber
resources are available in perpetuity and is advancing initiatives both in and outside japan




the sumitomo forestry group owns
forests with a total area of 42868
hectares within japan outside japan it
manages forests with a total area of
approximately 200000 hectares the
functions of forests that serve the public
good can be enhanced by appropriate
forestry management including weeding
pruning and thinning
forests absorb co2 then retain it as
carbon  or carbon stock the carbon
stock of the sumitomo forestry group
forests in japan was 1074 million tco2
and the carbon stock of plantation forests
overseas was 362 million tco2



                                                       189                          sumitomo forestry csr report 2012

                                                                                  environmental report  preserving forests




in fiscal 2011 the sumitomo forestry group harvested approximately 560000m3 of trees the harvested
trees were milled and processed then provided to the world as a variety of applications including housing and
furniture in some cases for example structural members used in houses the timber will be used for decades
even after trees are processed into products the wood continues to retain co2 as carbon thus it can be
said that using wooden products and building woodconstruction homes are activities that create forests in
cities


     carbon stock in housing

     one sumitomo forestry home house has a carbon
     stock of about 226 tco2 the carbon stock of all
     houses constructed by the company in fiscal 2011
     9007 houses totaled approximately 203000 tco2

     1 carbon stock of the timber used in housing construction in fiscal 2011




wood products can still be used effectively even after they have served their purpose for example in the
case of woodconstruction homes the lumber can be reused after demolition as wooden materials such as
boards
wood chips resulting from this process of reuse and wood that has served its purpose as a wooden product
can still be used as wood fuel this is called cascade usage and is a way to use wood completely and totally
in this way carbon is retained until wood products are used as biomass fuel to create electricity at this point
the co2 released from burning the wood is the co2 that was absorbed during the trees growth process so the
co2 in the atmosphere has not been increased during the life cycle of the tree

  link in this report promoting wood biomass power generation p233



just harvesting trees and using the timber means forestry resources will be diminished sumitomo forestry
always plants and cultivates new trees after harvesting trees to ensure sustainability of forest resources
in fiscal 2011 sumitomo forestry planted forests in japan with a total area of approximately 54 hectares and
13905 hectares overseas from a carbon stock perspective during the time wood products used in cities are
retaining carbon newly planted trees grow absorb co2 and retain carbon by promoting operations that
encourage greater use of timber resources through the structural application and incorporation of wood
companyowned forests and the carbon retained in the homes built by sumitomo forestry thus increase the
carbon stock and contribute to counteracting global warming




     i am interested in your use of japanese timber i hope that you continue to use it in the future
     and also that you educate people on the importance of using it student
     you communicated well your companys philosophy with regards to timber other stakeholder

 ranging lidar technology

   policy  plans

sumitomo forestry is using airborne laser imaging detection and ranging lidar on a trial basis in some of
its forests in order to accurately identify the volume of resources in these forests to more accurately calculate
the sustainable harvestable volume over the mediumtolong term and to build an efficient and effective forest
management model


   results

implementation of lidar
forest measurement using lidar was carried out over approximately 1500 hectares of companyowned
forest in kyushu and the measurement data was then analyzed lidar is a technology for obtaining detailed
measurement of the ground surface laser beams are projected onto the ground by a laser measuring device
on board an aircraft or a helicopter and ground measurements are obtained from the direction of the reflected
beam and the time it takes to arrive when used in a forest region it is possible to obtain detailed data
including the topography and height of the trees

validation of lidar efficacy
the efficacy of lidar in surveying the volume of forest resources was confirmed by validating the precision of
forest stand lidar measurement based on a field survey


   future plans

additional surveys are due to be carried out in forest stands where existing forest survey data differs
significantly from the fiscal 2010 validation results in order to enhance the precision of the survey data
widearea measurement of forests using lidar will also be carried out in other regions in order to build an

expansion of supply using companydeveloped standard fs forest service grade
in order to increase demand for japanese timber it is necessary to provide products with consistent quality
while also ensuring stable supply in fiscal 2009 sumitomo forestry wood products co ltd began selling
japanese timber products using a companydeveloped standard for precut timber the fs forest service
grade the other companydeveloped standard is mizdas1 which is targeted at timber blocks of japanese
cedar and cypress but fs grade is a general standard for precut timber covering cedar posts and studs
this standard leads to enhanced recovery rate and costcompetitiveness for example by broadening the
acceptable range of surface cracks and by allowing wane if it is within 30cm from the tip end of the timber as
the wane is cut at the precut stage
sales have been focused on the kanto tohoku and hokuriku regions and in fiscal 2011 supplies of fs grade
products reached 390000m3 13 times the fiscal 2010 level

  implementing largescale commercial forest plantation business


   policy  plans

sumitomo forestry is conducting a largescale commercial forest plantation business in cooperation with alas
kusuma group a company involved in the forestry management and plywood manufacturing businesses in
indonesia as well as realizing the stable supply of timber this initiative not only contributes to the economic
development of the local community by providing employment for local residents in commercial forest plantation
operations but also to the preservation of biodiversity


   results

implementing fullscale plantation operations
this initiative classifies forestland degraded by illegal logging and slashandburn farming into three areas 1
forests preservation zones 2 buffer zones and 3 forestation zones by further classifying forestation zones
by environmental factors such as soil composition and moisture content the initiative matches forestation
operations to local environmental conditions fullscale plantation operations started in 2010

promoting initiatives and research into the right tree for the
right site
aiming for sustainable commercial plantation forestry that contributes to the
preservation of biodiversity sumitomo forestry identifies areas to protect
such as riparian forests and carries out mosaic planting whereby
forestation is undertaken only in designated areas suited for that purpose
in addition the company continues to undertake research into the suitability
of trees in specific areas selecting species of trees that are suited to the
land in the particular plantation site                                                trees grown on an industrial
                                                                                                  plantation

   future plans

the plan is to expand the area of plantation operations from the current 140000 hectares to 280000
hectares
when drawing up forestation plans in the future the company is also considering the use of leadingedge
satellite information technology currently under development through joint research with the japan aerospace
exploration agency jaxas space open lab system

 preserv ation initiativ es at companyowned forests in japan


the company has created the sumitomo forestry red data book
to list the rare flora and fauna that might exist in companyowned
forests and provides training to those who work in these forests
this data book was created with reference to the red data book
published by prefectural authorities and is updated whenever
necessary forests are subject to appropriate zoning based on
criteria such as tree growth volume and efforts are being made to
protect areas around water which are rich in biodiversity through
the creation of a riparian forest management manual                          sumitomo forestry red data book

since fiscal 2008 the company has conducted monitoring surveys
of the habitation status of mammalian and avian species in companyowned forests in order to ascertain the
longterm impact of logging and plantation operations on mammalian and avian species surveys will be
conducted in the regions of hokkaido shikoku kyushu and wakayama with one of the four regions being
surveyed each year therefore the plan is to survey the same region once every four years

in 2012 the company plans to conduct its second monitoring survey to assess the habitation status of
mammalian and avian species in companyowned forests in the shikoku region




     i think its wonderful that sumitomo forestry is carrying out very specific activities such as
     creating the red data book and conducting monitoring surveys customer

policy on biodiversity preservation in companyowned forests in japan
excerpt
formulated september 2006

1 diversity of ecosystems
   we will properly manage strictly protected areas designated under the natural parks law and
   other legislation in a manner stipulated by the law in other areas we will ensure continuity of
   forests by limiting the area of forest harvested particularly when clear cutting is conducted

2 diversity of species
   we will work to prevent a decline in the number of species existing in natural forests by
   refraining from expansive planting projects and other extreme activities involving the
   replacement of species that would have a major impact on existing ecosystems we will also
   give the utmost consideration to the protection of rare flora and fauna in all operations
   making reference to the sumitomo forestry red data book

3 genetic diversity
   genetic variation and the maintenance of populations to support them will become issues in
   the future however analysis is complicated and therefore we will closely watch monitoring
   activities carried out by government and public institutions and their findings




monitoring surveys of mammalian and avian species in companyowned
forests

as part of a monitoring program for sgec1 forestry certification in may 2011 sumitomo forestry
conducted a monitoring survey of companyowned forests in wakayama prefecture mammalian
and avian species were surveyed and photographed at fixed locations to obtain the basic
information needed to preserve biodiversity in companyowned forests and determine the impact
of logging on the surrounding environment
in june 2011 it also conducted a monitoring survey of companyowned forests in the shikoku
region momi no ki yama in conjunction with the adoption by the company of a new method of
smallarea clear cutting at momi no ki yama this survey was designed to evaluate what effect
this method was having on biodiversity this monitoring survey will be continued over a period of
several years and survey items will include effects on plants insects and soil animals

1 japans own forestry certification system through which forest management is verified as sustainable by third parties certification is
   based on seven criteria that include the preservation of biodiversity and the conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources


survey results

the survey confirmed the presence of the asian black bear and the japanese serow in
companyowned forests in wakayama

based on the results of the monitoring survey conducted in companyowned forests in
wakayama regional environmental planning inc the company that conducted the survey
made the following observations on the impact of clear cutting upon mammalian and avian
species

1 mammalian species
   in addition to ascertaining the effects of clear cutting in the clear cutting area the survey
   confirmed that while there was a fairly large number of confirmed sightings of herbivores due
   to the fence erected to prevent the entry of deer only a few species were observed namely
   hare lepus brachyurus and japanese sika deer in addition although only a small number
   of animal species were observed in the clearcutting area a variety of species were found to
   be present in the adjacent forest area therefore as plant life recovers it is thought that in
   the future these clearcutting areas will also become habitats for a variety of living creatures



                                                                      214                                       sumitomo forestry csr report 2012

                                                                          environmental report  preserving biodiversity



2 avian species
   the effects of clear cutting were conspicuous only a few bird species were confirmed in the
   clearcutting areas and there was an obvious difference between clearcutting areas and the
   surrounding forest in terms of bird numbers species formation of groups and territories
   however it is considered that this result indicates not a situation in which birds were
   completed segmented between the two areas but rather a situation in which continuity was
   comparatively well maintained from these observations it is thought that going forward bird
   species will increase as plant life recovers in clearcutting areas

3 shared
   the area covered by this survey supports a wide variety of mammalian and avian species
   umbrella species6 such as asian black bear and endangered species such as the
   japanese serow capricornis crispus great spotted woodpecker dendrocopos major and
   the japanese thrush turdus cardis are confirmed and thus it is thought that habitats
   capable of supporting a diverse range of mammalian and avian species are being preserved

the company will continue to carry out the monitoring survey in collaboration with regional
environmental planning inc with the goal of accumulating data to ascertain what effects its
forestry operations are having on the surrounding forest and to investigate forestry methods that
will minimize any adverse impact moreover it is also using the results of the surveys to set
appropriate numerical values for targets

  landscaping operations that help to preserv e biodiv ersity


    policy  plans

sumitomo forestry and sumitomo forestry landscaping co ltd have named the biodiversityfriendly plants
and trees to be used in landscaping harmonic plants1 and actively promote them

through the landscaping business the companies have been encouraging planting that includes native
species and aiming for promotion of biodiversity they have clearly classified the trees and plants used in
landscaping from the perspective of biodiversity as harmonic plants so that species having a clearly
adverse impact on local ecosystems are not used
the conservation level for the planned planting site is classified into one of four area typesprotected area
conservation area satoyama area countryside close to rural communities city areaand local seedlings
native plants and cultivatable species are used according to the impact on each areas ecosystem in the
landscaping of residential gardens consideration is given to the color of the space by incorporating certain
cultivatable species and introduced plants that do not affect the local ecosystem rather than limiting planting
only to native plants

the thinking behind harmonic plants




1 protected areas do not include harmonic plants as the artificial transplanting or introduction of plants is not permitted

forestry crest co ltd which manufactures synthetic resin adhesives and other products is a designated
facility under the stipulations of the water pollution control law the other factories primarily manufacture
processed wood products such as plywood and housing interior materials and thus do not use large amounts

measures to cut dow n on water usage
the no 2 kyushu plant of sumitomo forestry crest co ltd uses industrial water to cool manufacturing
equipment then reuses it to dilute plant effluent and processes it appropriately as industrial effluent the four
initiatives described below are ongoing in order to reduce the amount of water used however due to the
reason described below in fiscal 2011 the volume of industrial water used increased by 11 compared with
the previous fiscal year

the water quality of industrial effluent is processed so that it meets the standard set in prefectural regulations
but an inspection of water quality in fiscal 2010 found that on occasions its cod value1 was close to
exceeding the standard therefore in fiscal 2011 the plant had to increase the volume of industrial water used
in order to stably keep this value well below the standard

going forward in addition to continuously implementing the four measures described below sumitomo
forestry group will work to decrease the volume of industrial water that it uses through efforts including the
launch of a project to improve its effluent technologies and the processing of effluent with the absolute
minimum level of dilution water

 1 redesign production plans to match the actual production sequence in order to decrease the number of
     times equipment is washed
 2 recirculate some of the water used to wash equipment for reuse as a raw material
 3 cover a storage pool for effluent with a roof to prevent rain from increasing wastewater volume
 4 enhance the efficiency of rainwater use including by measures to upgrade the pumps used to collect
     rainwater

1 chemical oxygen demand this shows the amount of oxygen required to oxidize an organic compound in water and is considered one of the most
   important indicators of water quality

developing a technology to identify cherry tree varieties
through an analysis of their dna
the cherry tree is the flowering tree most synonymous with japan
and breeding to create new varieties has taken place here since the
muromachi period as a result it is said that today there are more
than 250 varieties of cherry tree however it is extremely difficult to
identify the variety solely from the trees external appearance and
therefore sumitomo forestry collaborated with the forestry and
forest products research institute a national institute of genetics                         dna extraction
and the association for the propagation of knowledge on genetics
to jointly develop a technology to identify the variety through dna markers

completing a dna database of approximately 200 cultivated varieties
in march 2010 the company completed the creation of a database of 200 varieties of cherry trees for which
dna information was available in collaboration with the forestry and forest products research institute
using the abovedescribed identification technology the database clearly identifies and organizes the data on
individual varieties making it possible to accurately identify and manage the data in the future

successful breeding of yuten cherry tree protected species using plant tissue culture
techniques
the yuten cherry tree is an ancient breed found at seiganji temple tokyo that has been designated a
protected species in shinagawa ward due to the advanced age of the trees and rapid changes in the
environment in recent years the trees have shown signs of decay in their canopies raising the need to plant
successors in 2011 sumitomo forestry co ltd and sumitomo forestry landscaping co ltd were
successful in breeding seedlings of these trees using their plant tissue culture techniques based on progress
made thus far in development and applied research
in addition during their most recent investigation the companies used the database of cherry tree dna to
attempt to identify the dna of the yuten cherry tree and they concluded that it is highly likely that it is a new
variety the company is also involved in a range of other initiatives to breed and preserve japans historically
and culturally important trees

due to field burning and also for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through biomass power generation using
timber procured from these sustainable forests a large area of forest in this area has been degraded but as
forests play an important role here as a water source for the hydroelectric dams that are dispersed throughout
the region there is an urgent need for them to be protected and regenerated in addition this region is one of
the most deprived in vietnam and the launch of a forest preservation and regeneration project will contribute
to environmental protection and sustainable development in the region while the company is aiming to develop
projects that can acquire emissions credits in japan the company is currently collaborating with the relevant

measures to regenerate forests in indonesian peatlands
large volumes of carbon accumulate in peatlands when this land is developed for farming it must be dried by
drainage and as a result the microorganisms in the soil decompose which in turn causes the accumulated
carbon to be released into the atmosphere as co2 in addition fires can occur in peatlands that have been
dried which causes large quantities of co2 to be released into the atmosphere both of these forms of co2
emissions contribute to global warming
in fiscal 2011 the ministry of economy trade and industry commissioned a survey on the feasibility of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions through measures to prevent largescale fires in the peatlands in the
central part of kalimantan province indonesia sumitomo forestry collaborated with sumitomo corporation
and shimizu construction co ltd to carry out the survey its role being to investigate methods of
regenerating the vegetation that would also benefit the local people and economy it was able to contribute to
the project through constructing a new mechanism that can help prevent global warming by preserving the
peatland and ensuring that it is used appropriately

having read that as of july 2011 sumitomo forestry had constructed 386 emergency housings in miyagi
prefecture and 118 emergency housings in fukushima prefecture following the great east japan earthquake
i would first like to pay tribute to the persons involved this year the title of this report has changed to csr
report i sensed that careful consideration had been given to the reader with regard to information disclosure
such as the division of the report into policy and plans results and future plans in order to convey
continuous improvement and the inclusion of an iso26000 compliant contents index

my attention is also drawn to specific initiatives such as the formulation of four material issues in fiscal 2007
and engagement in a continuous dialogue with its stakeholders and the operation of a hospital kindergarten
and supermarket by a group company in papua new guinea in consideration of the limited role of the
government as well as the construction of two reinforced concrete subsidence bridges in accordance with the
wishes of the local people in march 2012 the company also published a biodiversity declaration comprising
longterm goals to address the aichi target of the convention on biological diversity which was a pioneering
initiative among japanese companies

thinking about the sumitomo forestry groups social responsibility through reading this report i was
reaffirmed that sustainable forestry is key with the advance of industrialization and population growth around
the world largescale deforestation the expansion of agricultural land infrastructure development hunting and
fishing are causing the loss of precious natural environments and wildlife if we are unable to establish a way
of retaining our natural resources while enjoying the benefits of prosperity society will become unsustainable
and the future will be bleak

arguably sustainable forestry involving the planting of trees the cultivation of forests and their use as natural
resources and replanting to replace what has been used should be a model for all companies and economic
activity however at present it cannot be said that a cycle of sustainable forestry has been fully established
even when considering sumitomo forestry and its group companies the company has set out a goal of
providing timber products and materials from sustainable forests and although the ratio of timber from
certified forests and plantation forests reached 70 a year in advance of the fiscal 2012 target there is still
some way to go


                                                        242                           sumitomo forestry csr report 2012

                                                                                                     third party evaluation



turning to the situation in japan sumitomo forestry owns some of the nations most outstanding forests and
while its efforts to steadily increase the area of these forests should be applauded unfortunately the
management of domestic forests has yet to be fully established as a business

i visited a companyowned forest in ehime prefecture and i felt acutely that the value of forests or timber
materials is extremely underappreciated if i were to express my hopes in the sumitomo forestry group in a
few words it would be that sumitomo forestry becomes a corporate group that achieves sustainable
forestry both in name and substance

of course various competitive conditions make it difficult to achieve this sometimes the company could be
forced to make difficult decisions such as passing on high costs to its customers and suppliers however we
now truly need companies that can firmly establish a business model such as sustainable forestry drawing
also on the collective efforts of society

coincidentally the united nations conference on sustainable development rio20 held in june 2012
adopted a natural capital declaration stating that the stock of natural capital that provides food fiber water
health energy climate security and other ecological services should be adequately valued in the same way as
social and financial capital

in the public opinion poll on forests and lifestyle conducted by the cabinet office in december 2011 81 of
respondents said they would choose a wooden house if building a house and use of domestic timber
increased 5 percentage points from the previous survey to 40 as something that was valued other than price
in the selection of a wooden house

this report also discusses initiatives such as promoting the greater use of timber mocca the proactive use
of domestic timber contributions to public policy and streamlining through joint operations in future i hope that
the company will clearly report progress on these issues and make even greater efforts to educate consumers
so as to enhance the value of forests and foster an organized base of supporters

the top message mentions the companys aim to be the worlds leading forestry company i hope that this
aim includes the sense of being one of the worlds very few companies to demonstrate true sustainability in its
business rather than simply the scale of revenues and profits i hope that sumitomo forestry continues with
its efforts to realize sustainable forestry and heads the list of japanese companies that have won the
respect of the world

reply to third party evaluation

we asked mr eiichiro adachi to share his opinion as this years thirdparty evaluator we
invited him to visit locations including a site of the companys forestry operations a production
line at a building materials manufacturing plant and a wood biomass power generation plant
as a natural resource the value of wood is wide ranging by planting trees cutting and utilizing
them when the time for harvesting arrives and then planting trees again renewable wood
becomes a sustainable resource
we note mr adachis comment that society now needs a business format that sustains this
cycle as well as educational activities to enhance the value of wood which we take to heart
both as an expectation of sumitomo forestry and our own responsibility going forward we will
continue to engage closely with our stakeholders while striving to promote sustainable business
activities utilizing wood
