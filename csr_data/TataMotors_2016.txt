          tata motors are compassionate for the environment and take
          decisions which directly or indirectly have a positive impact on
          our ability to preserve environment and create social values for
          stake holders  for the society at large




we use materiality assessment to determine the priority of

as part of salvaging new projects are continuously taken         such eﬀort is through recycling of metal and forging scrap
for salvaging worn out parts by using metallurgical                which is reused at our foundries in pune and jamshedpur
engineering this salvaging helps in increasing the recycle        through this recycling we are able to partially oﬀset the
content of engine for example an equivalent engine               need for fresh metal this recycling signi cantly
weighs about 360kg and 23rdof its parts are recycled back         contributes to reducing the environmental impact since
