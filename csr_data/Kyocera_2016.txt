the origin of kyocera group management is the kyocera philosophy a philosophy for work and life based on the reallife
experiences and empirical rules of kazuo inamori founder and chairman emeritus of kyocera corporation with what is
the right thing to do as a human being as its most essential criterion the kyocera philosophy expounds the significance
of commitment to fair management and operation in compliance with the most fundamental human ethics moral values
and social norms

the management rationale of the kyocera group is to provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of
all our employees and through our joint efforts contribute to the advancement of society and humankind the material
and intellectual growth that we aim for includes the pursuit of economic stability and entails the pursuit of mental riches

other means the guidelines for action in pursuing the management rationale are set out in the kyocera philosophy as
a state of mind for leading wonderful lives we are striving day by day to practice the kyocera philosophy




   origin of the kyocera philosophy

in 1959 with the generous support of the people around them company founder kazuo inamori and seven other
colleagues established kyoto ceramic co ltd now kyocera corporation starting with a meager amount of capital the
company had no imposing office building or elaborate machinery in the beginning all it had were fellow colleagues who
shared the joys and sorrows and formed a close bond as members of one big family inamori then decided to base the
management of the company on this bond of human minds this is because he believed that while human minds are
extremely changeable they are also most dependable once the minds are bonded by strong trust

later inamori encountered many difficulties in managing kyocera but he overcame them each time believing in the
strong bond of human minds the kyocera philosophy was thus born as he debated his life and work




   basic ideas of the kyocera philosophy
                                                                5

the criterion of what is the right thing to do as a human being is based on the fundamental ethical and moral values of
the natural goodness of human beings dont be greedy dont cheat people dont lie and be honest are teachings
we all received from our parents as children and represent the most basic principles of humankind

we believe that when making decisions and taking action in daily life we should resort to the criterion of what is
universally right as a human being and not the criterion of what best suits our own convenience

response to conflict minerals




   about conflict minerals


in recent years there is concern that mineral resources
mined in the democratic republic of the congo and
neighboring countries may serve as a source of funds
to the armed groups that have caused human rights
violations and this has become an international issue

knowing that some revenue of minerals produced from
the democratic republic of the congo and its
neighboring countries in africa  including columbite
tantalite tantalum cassiterite tin gold wolframite
tungsten and their derivatives  are used to fund
armed groups that commit human rights violations the
doddfrank legislation of july 2010 designates these
minerals as conflict minerals regardless of where they
are produced and requires all companies listed on the
new york stock exchange to disclose information on
the use of these minerals in their products




   kyocera groups policy on conflict minerals


the kyocera group always sticks to its principle of fair trading according to the kyocera philosophy for the specific
procurement policy the kyocera supplychain csr deployment guideline is provided to our business partners and asks
for their cooperation the kyocera groups policy is that we will not purchase materials or products that use conflict
minerals and their derived metals which are mined in the democratic republic of the congo and neighboring countries
and serve as a source of funds to the armed groups that have caused humanrights violations we have established the
kyocera supplychain csr deployment guideline which states our policy on conflict minerals to help our business
partners understand our stance and policy

   organizational system to handle conflict mineral issue


in the kyocera group the kyocera conflict mineral committee consisting of directors or general managers of
departments in charge of procurement materials ir general affairs internal auditing and legal affairs has been
established as the central player to deal with the conflict mineral issue this committee determines the methods that
serve as the basis of conflict mineral investigation and the information to disclose about conflict minerals and provides
reports on its activities to the top management in a timely and appropriate manner furthermore the committee provides
education to kyocera group companies about the rules and policies on conflict minerals and makes sure the entire group
appropriately deals with the problem of conflict minerals since this issue can only be handled with the combined efforts
of the entire supply chain kyocera actively seeks coordination and cooperation with relevant industrial associations

 jeita japan electronics and information technology industries association




   actions for business partners and survey results


in august 2012 following the announcement of detailed regulations relating to the
conflict minerals provision in a us financial regulatory reform bill kyocera
internally decided on the most salient points of an industrysupported survey as
conflict minerals present industrywide issues we started investigations in 2013
based on the framework of the conflict free smelter cfs program created by the
electronics industry citizenship coalition eicc and the global esustainability
initiative gesi in 2014 kyocera held 9 explanatory meetings in japan tokyo
osaka and china shanghai dongguan where kyoceras suppliers are mainly
concentrated to explain policies for dealing with conflict minerals and to request
cooperation with the survey a total of 389 companies attended these meetings              explanatory meetings for suppliers


the recovery ratio of the raw material country of origin slip increased from 938 in 2013 to 947 in 2014

a close examination of responses revealed that 75 of suppliers were purchasing conflict minerals from the drc and
surrounding countries kyocera designated these suppliers as critical suppliers to survey and conducted due diligence
in accordance with the law

aside from these 75 critical suppliers 51 of suppliers responded that they had not yet completed their own survey of
origin for their products in the 2014 survey and as such we have created a system that enables us to improve the survey
and identify the condition of these suppliers from 2015 onward

more specifically a survey manager was appointed for each supplier throughout the survey period to build a working
relationship with the supplier the survey manager also held direct talks with the supplier on several occasions during the
survey period and continuously updated survey findings in addition we created the opportunity to share and learn more
about the latest information by holding regular meetings for the purpose of increasing the researchers understanding and
knowledge toward the conflict minerals survey

at the current point in time kyocera has discovered no information regarding a high risk of connection with armed groups
in the drc and surrounding countries



   kyocera groups future measures


the kyocera group recognizes the importance of continuing its survey using the cfs program and in identifying and
investigating smelters and refiners

therefore we intend to continually establish a strong supply chain relationship through various measures including the
signing of a letter of engagement with suppliers that includes a pledge to contact kyocera immediately if a connection to a
conflict mineral has been uncovered

it is important to increase the number of smelters that submit to an independent thirdparty audit in order to be assessed
as conflictfree however since it is difficult for a single company to prompt smelters to participate in such audits
kyocera continues to work through industry organizations such as jeita for this purpose

  actions for workload reduction activities
kyocera america inc conducts measures to reduce the
physical burden on workers bodies during work from an
ergonomic viewpoint for example workers would often
feel pain in their neck and head in the quality inspection
process as they maintained their posture of looking down
into a microscope for many hours as a solution a work
desk whose height is adjustable with an electric motor was
introduced to allow workers to use the microscope adjusted
to the height of their eyes this successfully reduced the
physical burden on employees from long hours of work

love people the kyocera group has focused all corporate activities on three pillars of
coexistence living together coexisting with our community coexisting with global
society and coexisting with nature the entire kyocera group is committed to
environmental management and aims for sustainable corporate development while striving
to combine the goals of ecology and economy

the kyocera group handles many chemical substances during production processes
such as raw materials and chemical agents for fine ceramics regarding treatment of
waste water from factories our policy is to purify discharged water to a state cleaner than
the water system into which it is to be released

it is kyocera group policy to render any industrial waste as harmless as possible by using
the latest technology

based on this concept the kyocera group enacted the kyocera environmental charter in
1991 the companys basic philosophy regarding the environment kyocera established its
environment vision 2020 in order to embody the kyocera environmental charter and
define the companys stance on a longterm basis up to 2020 as a yearly goal to achieve
this vision kyocera has formulated the kyocera group global environmental policy




   kyocera environmental charter

based on the concept of coexistence living together the kyocera group established the kyocera environmental
charter which provides for comprehensive measures on environmental protection development of environmentally
friendly products energy conservation climate change prevention resource conservation waste reduction proper
management of chemical substances and biodiversity protection in order to create a lowcarbon producing society
recycling society and a society in harmonious coexistence with nature



   environment vision 2020

the kyocera group has established the environment vision 2020 which clarifies the goals to be achieved by 2020 in
order to work on environmental management aimed at sustainable growth while satisfying both ecology and economy
demands


   kyocera group global environmental policy

the kyocera group has established the kyocera group global environmental policy which sets yearly targets to be
attained in the four areas of greenhouse gases energy water and industrial waste


 in all production sites the greenhouse effect gas emissions energy consumption water consumption and industrial
 waste discharge will be reduced by 1 or more from a year earlier in terms of energy consumption unit improvement

                                                                                                      revised june 1 2013
i preface
technological progress and economic development in industrialized countries have given rise to affluent societies with
high standards of living at the same time they have led to the mass consumption of natural resources and mass
discharge of chemical substances  which in turn now threaten to escalate environmental pollution and destroy the
earths ecosystem in addition explosive population growth and widespread poverty in developing countries have
aggravated these environmental problems with largescale deforestation the social and economic activities of both
advanced and developing countries are intertwined and with all parties intent on greater material consumption natures
recuperative powers have been exceeded as a result the earths natural regenerative mechanism has been damaged
on a global scale

one of our major premises up to this time  that the earths ecosystem is infinitely large  is now being rejected in favor
of the idea that the earth is a closed ecosystem such a change in view affects the very foundation of humankinds
existence and demands a reevaluation of the quality and quantity of the products used by humankind this in turn will
lead to a fundamental change in the industrial  technological system within which such products are manufactured

in the course of history humankind has witnessed three eras of rapid development the agricultural revolution the
industrial revolution and the information revolution it is generally felt that the current environmental movement will
someday be regarded as humankinds fourth era of rapid development the environmental revolution

our future thus requires new policy goals these should state that development and economic growth may be pursued
only when proper consideration is given to the balance between nature and society and environmental conservation
while an individuals impact may be small the cumulative result from a rapidly expanding population could cause
complete environmental destruction

therefore it is essential to establish a basic philosophy of coexistence and coprosperity between the developed and
developing countries between business and government and between individuals and societies all must be viewed as
participants in the stewardship of mother earth not as opposing forces with conflicting interests

the greatest responsibility for promoting the environmental revolution lies with the advanced countries in particular
businesses in such countries play a vital role as they possess production technologies and are directly engaged in
industrial activities


ii basic philosophy
in accordance with our corporate motto  respect the divine and love people  since its foundation kyocera has
adhered closely to its management rationale to provide opportunities for the material and intellectual growth of all our
employees and through our joint efforts contribute to the advancement of society and humankind we strive to conduct
business in harmony with the lifegiving force of our universe kyocera had early insight into the mindset that todays
global environmental problems make demands of every business enterprise this mindset implies that business should
uphold the dignity of humankind and contribute to the sustainable development of society

based on the management rationale stated above the kyocera group adopts comprehensive measures for the creation
                                                           57
of a lowcarbon producing sustainable society  a society which exists in harmony with nature  and will further
heighten our goals towards environmental protection development of environmentally friendly products energy

employees and their children as students

overseas kyocera also carried out active efforts including
participation in local environmentrelated events



   environmental risk management

the kyocera group established the kyocera group environmental management standard in 1992 which is stricter than
statutory and public regulations on emissions wastewater soil and groundwater based on this environmental
management standard we have more stringent voluntary management standards for each site thorough management
for environmental conservation is thus ensured using these strict standards including periodic environmental
measurement in addition we have soil and groundwater management regulations to ensure the prevention of soil
contamination to comply with these regulations we take various measures including the use of double wall structures
for underground storage tanks and leakage detection systems 63to promote early detection of leaks and prevention of the
spread of contamination

conducted various activities during this period including a                poster of eco           participation in an environmental event

 promotion of green procurement

aware of the importance of making efforts in the entire supply chain including kyocera as well as our suppliers and
business associates in order to tackle worsening global environment issues kyocera formulated the kyocera green
procurement guideline in 1998 and has promoted green procurement since then in fy2014 we revised this guideline
and divided it into two guidelines the kyocera guideline on environmentally hazardous substances which established
the standards for product specifications in promoting green procurement and the kyocera guideline on environmental
protection activities which describes the guiding principles of kyoceras idea of environmental protection activities with
this revision we have reinforced our ties with our business partners

  supplychain bcp survey
kyocera asks business partners to have their own business continuity plan bcp in order to ensure that there is no
interruption of important operations in the event of damage by a disaster or an accident to be able to restart operations
as soon as possible even if they are interrupted and to continue the supply of products and services to customers

in fy2015 we sent a detailed questionnaire sheet about bcp efforts to our business partners who supply important
components necessary to realize uninterrupted supply so that they can understand kyoceras concept of bcp at the
same time we asked them to monitor the current condition of their own bcp efforts and promote further efforts
specifically the questionnaire sheet asked about important points regarding bcp including the policy system action
planning implementation of actions restoration procedures and drills and training

82 of roughly 440 business partners who handle important components about 1300 necessary to realize our supply of
products and services to customers answered that they currently conduct bcp effort

kyocera will continue to promote and spread bcp in the kyocera supplychain to help our business partners further
promote their own bcp activities
