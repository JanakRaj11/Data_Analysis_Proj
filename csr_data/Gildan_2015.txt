home  company  message from management

message from the president and ceo
in 2014 we made exciting progress in our strategic growth initiatives we spent close to 300 million in capital investments to upgrade
and refurbish existing facilities in addition to increasing our yarnspinning capacity globally we created over 8000 jobs to support the
companys growth strategy we have also added new consumer brands to our portfolio with the acquisition of substantially all of the
assets of doris inc the third largest marketer of branded ladies legwear in north america and the market leader in canada
the companys performance in the realm of corporate social responsibility csr is central to our overall business strategy this is why we
have continued to invest in the implementation of industryleading practices with respect to working conditions community support
environmental footprint and responsiblymade product offerings for example in 2014 due to the success of gildans schools for back
health in honduras we have developed schools for shoulder health with a total of 8 doctors and 9 nurses who were trained in order to
become certified instructors
we are continuing to surpass ahead of schedule some of the environmental targets we had set for 2015 for instance since 2010 gildan
has more than doubled its ghg emissions intensity reduction target which was established at 20 and has since achieved a 45
decrease in addition we are pleased to report that in 2014 53 of gildans total energy was powered by renewal sources and that the
company managed to repurpose or recycle more than 90 of its waste
the efforts we put into our social and environmental programs have once again been recognized with our inclusion on the dow jones
sustainability world index djsi world for a second consecutive year gildan is the only north american company in the textiles apparel
and luxury goods industry group to be included in the djsi world this year the company is particularly proud to have achieved the
highest score of all eight companies listed in the apparel industry in the categories of corporate governance risk and crisis management
occupational health  safety as well as to have been included in the top percentile ranking in the collective social dimension categories
this recognition reaffirms the importance we place on our csr program and the positive impact of continuously investing in our vertical
manufacturing business model which allows us to directly implement our various programs
this year is our first year reporting under the updated version of the global reporting initiative guidelines a leading organization in the
sustainability disclosure field one of the main changes resulting in the transition from the g31 to the g4 version of the guidelines is the
increased prominence of the materiality concept as part of the application of these updated guidelines in 2014 gildan conducted a
materiality assessment amongst its stakeholders the purpose of this exercise was to assess the importance our various stakeholders put
on a vast array of csr and businessrelated topics this ultimately allows us to ensure our sustainability report contains information about
subjects that our stakeholders consider to be of paramount interest the results of our materiality assessment are available in the
company section under the reporting subsection
finally gildan continues to be committed to being a member of internationallyrecognized organizations such as the fla wrap and the
sustainable apparel coalition with a noticeable increased interest in offering socially responsible products these standards combined
with our stringent code of conduct and auditing program have proven to be valuable for our customers
i would like to thank all gildan employees for their contribution to the companys csr and sustainability efforts and for their continued
support of our values and initiatives i am proud of all the hard work that we have done this year and i look forward to sharing news of
further achievements in next years report

home  company  reporting
gildan has published annual corporate citizenship reports covering the companys initiatives since 2004 due to the large quantity of
information and in order to offer readers a friendlier and dynamic format in 2011 we migrated all of the information to this new
dedicated website

for social and environmental responsibility professionals the information in this website has been structured in accordance with the
global reporting initiative gri g4 guidelines comprehensive gildan has submitted its reporting for 2014 to the global reporting
initiative and is currently waiting for their verification in order to ensure that at the time of publication of the g4 guidelinesbased report
general standard disclosure g417 to g427 were correctly located in both the content index and in the text of the final report we have
also included material indicators from the pilot of the apparel and footwear sector supplement

the gri index will help you navigate through the different guidelines the gri guidelines developed by a wide range of international
stakeholders have been adopted to enhance the quality credibility and comparability of the information we report these guidelines
were applied in the collection and interpretation of all data presented within the report and provide a widelyaccepted credible
framework for reporting on the economic environmental and social performance of an organization irrespective of size sector or
location

this websites information focuses on gildans 2014 fiscal year from september 30 2013 to october 5 2014 and discloses information
on issues pertaining to gildan owned locations in north america central america the caribbean basin and asia and any significant
impact resulting from operations therein information about our third party manufacturing contractors and raw material suppliers has also
been included when available unless otherwise specified data concerning our third party manufacturers covers contractor facilities
approved for production at the end of the reporting period when deemed relevant we have included data from earlier years which is
clearly indicated as such when applicable this website contains information on topics and matters that reflect the organizations
sustainability programs and initiatives with regard to corporate governance peoples wellbeing community engagement environmental
protection and product sustainability we report on these initiatives as we believe they are material to the apparel industry as well as of
interest to our main stakeholder groups more specifically our employees shareholders customers business partners governments local
authorities civil society organizations and the communities within which we operate

information pertaining to new buffalo shirt factory which was acquired on june 18 2013 has been included in our 2014 data
information pertaining to doris inc which was acquired on july 17 2014 has been included for most of the labourrelated data reported
however the environmentalrelated data as well as information related to our internal compliance audits have not been included in our
2014 data as the company was acquired during the fourth quarter of the 2014 fiscal year and we are still in the process of implementing
these programs it is indicated throughout the report when dorisrelated data has not been included the remaining results from the doris
operations will be included in our next reporting year please note that the doris owned and operated facility production represents less
than 1 of gildans total owned and operated facilities production

data collected and compiled within this report is the result of a collaborative effort by gildan staff throughout the companys many
locations with a variety of measurement techniques having been adopted


gildans baseline
gildans baseline year for the purpose of our target reporting is 2010 in 2012 gildan established reduction targets for its owned sites for
energy consumption greenhouse gas emissions water consumption as well as waste sent to landfill as part of this exercise gildan
partnered with a third party consultant in order to review reporting from previous years in terms of the indicators linked to reduction
targets to account for the companys recent acquisitions
accordingly the baseline year of 2010 has been adjusted and reports from subsequent years will be updated when a significant
cumulative change in the baseline year metrics is triggered the following conditions will trigger an adjustment if a significant change is
identified
   1 a structural change of gildans organizational boundaries ie merger acquisition or divestiture
   2 a change in calculation methodologies or emission factors
   3 additional or new data or methodology are available on source data that was not previously available or
   4 a significant error or a number of cumulative errors in the inventory are discovered significant is typically defined as a cumulative change  of five percent 5 or larger in total base
      year figures
as of 2014 operational data related to the recently acquired new buffalo shirt factory facilities in the united states and honduras have
been integrated to the 2010 baseline data related to the salisbury yarn spinning facility in the united states as well as the las americas
san pedro de macori sewing facility in the dominican republic have not been integrated to the 2010 baseline as these operations are
considered as organic growth and not acquisitions
similarly the rio nance 1 textile facility in honduras which restarted production in 2014 after a shut down for refurbishment has also not
been integrated into the 2010 baseline calculation
additionally based on availability and quality of data in the baseline year for water and waste streams representative data points from
the new buffalo shirt factory facilities have been backcast into 2010 in order to reestablish the baseline when errors from previous
reporting years have been identified they have been corrected and validated with our third party consultant to align the calculation
methodology across all years in order to ensure an accurate comparison
we are confident that the exercise we undertook to adjust our baseline year properly incorporated the recent acquisitions of the
company and will provide an accurate record in terms of our environmental target reporting which we will continue to use for our future
reporting



materiality
gildan considers materiality to be when a topic has high importance to stakeholders and high impact on the business in 2014 gildan
conducted its first formal companywide external stakeholder assessment and materiality analysis to identify topics most relevant to

gildan and to better inform its sustainability strategy
gildan worked with a third party to help facilitate an independent assessment of the process the materiality assessment included a five
step process with input from internal and external stakeholders
1 analyze available documentation and conduct senior leadership interviews
the first step included a review of documentation available such as internal business documents gildans past lifecycle assessment
results as well as research on current and emerging trends to extract topics that were relevant to gildans business considering both
issues within and outside gildans direct control
senior leaders from gildans different business functions and brands were interviewed in order to gain a better understanding of trends
opportunities and challenges across the business topics emphasized or mentioned across multiple interviews have been classified into
four different areas opportunities challenges industry trends and external factors
2 creating a gross list of potential topics and emerging issues relevant to the apparel sector and the business
resulting from the aforementioned step 1 a gross list of topics were identified and sorted per business relevant topics these areas
included
  employees manufacturing
  employees corporate functions
  environment
  operations
  social
  corporate governance and risks

the list of topics included under each of the broader aforementioned business relevant topics were used to facilitate the discussion
around how the company should prioritize these topics based on their impact on the business and importance to stakeholders
3 assess stakeholder priorities
to determine the importance of each topic to stakeholders a stakeholder assessment was conducted as a first step we developed a list
of stakeholders across gildans main stakeholder groups and we evaluated each stakeholder groups influence over gildan and interest in
gildan in order to build a stakeholder map
gildan stakeholder group surveyed included
  community investment and development nonprofits
  b2b customers
  media
  labour rights and human rights nonprofits
  manufacturing contractors
  raw material suppliers
  governmental representatives
  investors
  corporate social responsibility analysts and rating organizations
  trade associations

using our list of topics we conducted a stakeholder survey and asked more than 100 stakeholders to rate the importance of each topic on
a scale of least important to most important the topics rated by the stakeholder in the survey were weighted by degree of influence
and mapped on the y axis of the materiality matrix outlined below
4 define materiality for gildan
to further define what materiality means to gildan we organized a workshop to set the thresholds for when a topic has a high impact on
gildan the workshop included representatives from across the business and different operations passing any of these threshold would
mean the topic had a high impact on the business the thresholds were defined as follows
  a topic has a high impact on revenue generation if it generates

      5 change in gildans market share
      impact on gildans position in the united states market
      impact on gildans expansion in asia andor central and south america
      impact on compliance with major customers standards

  a topic has a high impact on costs if it generates

      1 change in operating expenses

  a topic has a high impact on employees if it generates

      impact on talent attraction and retention of hondurasbased employees

contractors  suppliers
when the decision is made to outsource production to any new contractor we carry out a comprehensive assessment in order to
determine the contractors ability to comply with our cost structures and quality standards we also evaluate their ability to comply with
our stringent labour and environmental standards the selection process includes a thorough analysis of the contractors social
responsibility practices this is done by having all potential contractors complete a selfassessment questionnaire weighing in on critical
issues as outlined by gildan gildan then performs a preliminary onsite audit prior to engaging with any contractor


gildans manufacturing contractor facilities
we manufacture the majority of our products in our verticallyintegrated manufacturing facilities please refer to our map of
operations for more details the total outsourced production represents less than 10 1 of our total production in terms of volume by
the end of 2014 we were outsourcing production to 57 third party contractor manufacturing facilities throughout different worldwide
locations these are represented per region in the following chart




1 please note that this percentage does not include production at the recently acquired manufacturing facilities in canada formerly
doris

contractual requirements
a contractual clause is included in all our commercial agreements in order to ensure that gildans contractors and suppliers respect our
code of conduct this practice encompasses the following agreements
  manufacturing contractors agreements including sewing or any third party manufacturing agreements
  raw material suppliers agreements and
  agreements for major equipment purchases



due diligence and social compliance process for sourcing facilities
new potential third party contractor
gildans sourcing policy states that all potential third party contractors used for the production of gildan branded apparel or licensee
products need to be audited prior to any production contracts being awarded in order to verify their social compliance practices these
audits are conducted by auditors who are thoroughly trained on gildans monitoring guidelines and social compliance programs in some
instances gildan will mandate a third party audit service provider to conduct these audits on its behalf
gildans third party contractors are assigned a rating based on their audit results audit results help our internal teams assess the level of
compliance of potential contractors facilities audit findings vary in severity depending on their classification when compared against our
code of conduct and the benchmarks outlined in our vendors guidebook if a potential contractor fails the initial audit they can only re
invite us for a compliance visit after a 3 month period in the event where the facility fails the second audit this facility will no longer be
considered as a potential contractor in the future no future orders will be accepted from this facility
current third party contractor
when a current contractor receives a low rating as a result of its annual audit our first step is to work with their management team in
order to correct any major issues found during the audit part of the process involves the establishment of an action plan in order to help
the facility improve their overall performance in addition systematic followups are carried out in order for the contractors to provide
updates on the progress achieved in resolving the pending issues
if no progress is shown during a predetermined period of time gildan can decide to end the business relationship with a contractor if the
compliance level of a facility is deemed insufficient in meeting gildans standards during the due diligence process orders can be
cancelled prior to the start of production in 2014 gildan turned down four contractor facilities due to insufficient compliance levels



contractor training
we have been providing training for employees at each of our longterm haitian sewing contractors on an ongoing basis in 2014 more
than 700 employees were trained on gildans code of conduct and nearly 600 employees were also trained on fire extinguisher use

contractors across gildanowned operations designed specifically for security employees hired by third party contractors the training
course offered focuses on common situations that security personnel employed by subcontractors might face while performing their
duties on behalf of gildan

home  people  code of conduct 
california transparency in supply chains act
in 2010 the california legislature passed the california transparency in supply chain act of 2010 sb 657 this new piece of legislation
requires manufacturers and retailers of goods with annual worldwide gross receipts over 100 million to provide consumers with
information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains

ilo conventions define that human trafficking can take many forms including but not limited to forced and child labor

  ilo convention on forced labour no 29
  ilo convention on abolition of forced labour no 105
  ilo conventions on the worst forms of child labour no 182
gildans code of conduct which was originally implemented in 2005 and was most recently updated in 2012 directs our activities at each
of our operating locations it clearly states our position on a wide range of labour practices

our code of conduct is based on the ilo conventions and its associated compliance benchmarks the referenced ilo conventions
address forced labour child labour wages and benefits working hours harassment and abuse as well as health and safety working
conditions are monitored at each of owned and contracted facilities producing our products gildans labour compliance program is
accredited by the fair labor association fla as such all companyowned facilities and those of our manufacturing contractors are
subject to the flas rigorous monitoring remediation and verification system the fla accredits monitors and uses internal auditors to
conduct unannounced verifications gildan was the first verticallyintegrated apparel manufacturer to have its social compliance program
accredited by the fla

please read below for details on how gildan complies with each points of the california transparency in supply chain act

1 company engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery
by its contractors

gildan evaluates the potential risks associated in its supply chain by conducting an evaluation of potential contractors prior to any
sourcing agreements through the use of its presourcing assessment this assessment helps guide our business decisions and
relationships with the manufacturing contractors we use

these assessments are designed to ensure that at a minimum all facilities manufacturing our products comply with our strict code of
conduct local and international laws and the codes which we adhere to including those set forth by the worldwide responsible
accredited production wrap and the fair labor association fla all the aforementioned codes and standards include strict provisions
with regards to forced and child labour such as human trafficking and slavery when external suppliers are used they must also adhere to
these codes this is a requirement for conducting business with gildan

to ensure that we meet or exceed our strict code of conduct requirements we conduct a series of independent internal and third party
audits each year ensuring our commitment to responsibility for our employees customers and other stakeholders in 2014 244
monitoring audits were performed 155 were conducted by gildans internal auditors or by external auditors on working on our behalf and
89 were conducted by external auditors under the direction of wrap the fla the ilo better work programme or by our own customers
for more information regarding gildans auditing process please refer to point 2 below

2 company conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and
slavery in supply chains the disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent unannounced audit

gildans goal is to visit 100 of its manufacturing facilities annually in addition we audit manufacturing facilities for third party
contractors at least once in an 18month period

effective since the 2014 fiscal year gildan implemented a new policy in which all of the audits conducted at our own facilities are
unannounced audits audits at third party manufacturing facilities will continue to be either unannounced or semiannounced audits the
majority of the audits are conducted by our trained internal auditors in addition we use third party auditors in some instances we are
also subject to audits from some of our customers

gildans code of conduct is the base for all audits conducted at our contractors manufacturing facilities assessments are also based on
the standards found in gildans vendor guidebook which is provided to all our contractors other auditing and monitoring tools include

  facility selfassessment questionnaires
  audit guidelines and management action plans
  management interview forms
  monitoring guidelines and
  worker interview guidelines
gildan uses a sampling methodology based on the sedex members ethical trade audit smeta guidelines in order to determine the
number of documents to be reviewed as well as the number of individuals to be interviewed

some of our contractors have been participating in the ilo better work programme gildans manufacturing facilities as well as its
contractors are also independently audited by the fla wrap and customers please refer to the social compliance section of our website
for more information

3 company requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws
regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business

to ensure that gildans major contractors and suppliers respect and adhere to gildans code of conduct we include a clause in our
commercial agreements governing our contractual relationship which stipulates that contractors must abide by our code gildan also
requires all business partners to confirm by means of a signed statement that they do not use or procure any cotton fibers originating
from uzbekistan in any of the yarns supplied to our organization or in the manufacturing of our products

in 2013 gildan established a cotton traceability assessment for a group of its cotton yarn suppliers in order to ensure that the cotton yarn
or products they supply us with do not contain cotton originating from uzbekistan

the suppliers included in the assessment were selected according to several risk factors that include their proximity to uzbekistan and
the quantities of yarn purchased by gildan or third party contractors manufacturing our products these assessments have been
conducted by a third party since 2014

in addition as part of the continuous improvement of our social compliance program and as a leading best practice in the second half of
fiscal 2014 we commenced the process of auditing key raw material suppliers during 2014 in total we completed the audit of five key
raw material suppliers the audits identified weaknesses in the areas of documentation of employee contracts and files excessive
overtime health and safety and environment

we are currently working with these suppliers in order to develop a remediation plan to address the findings as this is a new process and
a best in class standard we decided to not audit additional raw material suppliers in 2015 as we expect to achieve similar results to what
we saw in 2014

instead we have decided to focus our resources in assisting the raw material suppliers we audited in 2014 in implementing and executing
a proper remediation plan based on the success we achieve with this approach we will reevaluate how to best proceed in continuing
with such audits in 2016

4 company maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet
company standards regarding slavery and trafficking

noncompliance with gildans code of conduct can result in corrective action or even termination of a commercial agreement depending
on the number of noncompliances found as well as their severity gildan will always seek first for a viable remediation strategy with
suppliers found not in compliance with our code of conduct however we may terminate a business relationship with a contractor if
deemed necessary our team of internal auditors work with contractors to develop action plans to resolve any instances of non
compliance

5 company provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management
with training on human trafficking and slavery particularly with respect to mitigating risks within supply chains of
products

all gildan employees are trained on our code of conduct at our third party sewing contractors in haiti training on our code of conduct is
provided on an ongoing basis to all new employees our internal monitoring teams are continuously trained on social compliance and
human rights issues they also work closely with our management teams and our contractors to ensure they are knowledgeable on our
code requirements and understand the issues related to social compliance

home  people  working conditions
gildan offers an ethical and stimulating work environment we aim to provide a positive work environment for all of our employees

all production employees at our owned facilities earn significantly more than the legallymandated minimum industry wages in all the
countries in which we operate in addition in the majority of our locations our employees receive valuable competitive benefits such as
24hour access to gildans medical clinics free transportation to and from work subsidized meals and access to financial aid programs

in the coming years gildan will continue to develop initiatives that will build on our existing employee relations practices and ensure that
our health and safety practices are among the best in the apparel industry we will continue to strengthen our training and development
programs with the objective of creating an increased number of advancement opportunities for our employees

home  people  working conditions 
employment practices
gildan favours permanent employment positions over temporary contracts
reasons for this practice include

  optimization of the financial investment related to employee training and development
         there is a significant financial cost associated with the training of new employees as such gildan is most interested in investing in
         people who are willing to make a longterm commitment to the company
  reduction in recruitment costs for new employees
  easier integration of new employees into the companys culture and values
in some cases we recognize that hiring temporary employees is necessary some examples include

  for specific projects with a clear end date when we do not have the internal capacity or expertise required
  in order to fulfill temporary needs
  when experiencing a busier than usual workflow
  when it takes longer to find suitable permanent resources and someone is needed in the meantime
         summer interns we believe it is important to offer students realwork experience that provides them with the opportunity to apply
         what they have learned in their studies

gildan is proud of its record of creating wellpaying jobs with attractive benefits at all of our manufacturing locations some of the benefits
provided to our employees include access to free medical assistance access to financial aid programs and subsidized meals we also
provide subsidized transportation to and from work at the majority of our locations

we empower workers by providing them with the opportunity to upgrade their skill sets and education level through company offered
training programs all of our production employees earn significantly more than the legallymandated minimum industry wages in all the
countries where we operate this has had a direct and positive impact on the quality of life of our workers and their families

gildan also offers additional incentives to employees who exceed certain objectives these incentives which represent compensation
over their basic wage reward workers whose production efficiency is above average similar to the model used in many north american
companies

fair wages

since 2012 gildan has been conducting small pilot projects in honduras and the dominican republic in order to have a better
understanding of fair wages our studies include an analysis of salaries and paid inkind benefits that we provide to our employees in
addition we have been analyzing trends related to inflation in regards to food and housing as well as other studies developed by local
authorities and civil society organizations since food is one of the major components included as a basic need gildan has already started
to take actions in order to help our employees have access to groceries and basic household products at reduced prices to this effect we
have arranged for an establishment in nicaragua which is in close proximity to our facilities to provide employees with food product and
goods at discounted prices compared to market in doing this we have collaborated with the union of our facility which is playing an
active role in the administration of this store

as this is an important element to the overall working conditions we offer our employees gildan will continue to focus its efforts on
ensuring the salaries and total benefits offered to its employees are sufficient to meet basic needs

minimum wages in latin america

minimum wages in latin america typically vary according to the work category the legallymandated minimum wage in most latin
american countries will vary depending on the industry sector the various industry sectors include agriculture services industrial
banking and manufacturing

used to compare salaries in the textile industry as they relate to similar activities

minimum wages in haiti

as opposed to the bulk of gildans operations which are vertically integrated sewing operations in haiti are subcontracted by gildan to
third parties therefore to address the concerns which were raised regarding the issue of minimum wages in haiti gildan made a
commitment in november 2013 to require its third party contractors in the country to comply with the payment of 300 gourdes per day in
an eight hour work day to their piece rate workers based on the expectation that they continue to operate at a reasonable efficiency rate

we can assure you that nothing has changed with respect to our commitment and that we have taken proactive actions in this respect we
are pleased to have reached a conclusion towards ensuring compliance with this demand and would like to share the most recent details
with you as outlined below

  following several meetings held with union leaders in haiti over the course of the year they confirmed being in agreement with the
  applicable rate and the methodology used by us to audit compliance ie for the payment of 300 gourdes per day in an eight hour work
  day based on a reasonable efficiency rate as per our commitment to the workers rights consortium wrc
  we are pleased to report that on october 20th 2014 the primary union in the apparel industry in haiti sendika ouvriye tekstil ak
  abiman sotabo signed an agreement with one of our two contractors and both parties have agreed on the abovementioned
  payment structure gildan participated as a facilitator in the negotiation process and is currently dialoguing in order to provide for the
  signature of a similar agreement with our other contractor in the near future it is important to note that while there is no official
  agreement signed with this second contractor changes have already been implemented to reflect the applicable payment structure
  as supported by our independent audit process
  in collaboration with our own independent audit team we conducted audits at all of our contractor facilities in haiti in order to validate
  that payments made to piece rate workers were equivalent to a minimum of 300 gourdes per day in an eight hour work day based on
  the agreed upon piece rate with the union leaders in haiti
  we can report that after reviewing the results of these audits we are of the view that all of our contractor facilities are substantially in
  compliance with the parameters we have set with the unions
  we are committed to continue to deploy regular independent audits at our contractor facilities to validate compliance with the agreed
  payment to the piece rate workers
  gildan has been sourcing sewing production from haiti for over 15 years and will continue to do so in the future all contractors we deal
  with are responsible for implementing all necessary requirements in order to respect our code of conduct members of gildans team
  follow up regularly with our contractors and verify that they comply with our standards of quality and social compliance

rewarding employee dedication and performance

performance appraisals
gildan has a wellestablished performance appraisal process for all indirect employees and managers gildans performance appraisal
process is carried out on an ongoing basis that starts with a discussion of expectations and objectives at the beginning of the fiscal year in
addition a review and adjustment is conducted at midyear and an overall assessment of the employees objectives and competencies
fulfillment is done at the end of the year
the performance appraisal process for direct employees eg operators in the production facilities is based on the competencies
required by their position individual and team performance is also assessed against preset objectives in factors ranging from production
efficiency to quality and safety
this process brings important benefits to both the employee and the organization some examples of the benefits achieved include
increased individual and organizational performance better alignment of priorities and objectives clarification of performance
expectations increased employee engagement improved training needs identification and better decisionmaking in regard to all human
resources processes eg succession planning promotions salary increases variable compensation payments
gildans compensation philosophy
gildans compensation philosophy is designed to attract motivate and retain employees by encouraging and rewarding their
performance the compensation program is intended to help align employees interests with those of the corporations shareholders
in addition to the base salary gildans other compensation components include
shortterm incentive plan
all employees in management positions and a proportion of indirect employees including some clerical technical and professional
employees are eligible for a short term incentive plan the plan provides annual bonuses directly related to the achievement of key
financial objectives relative to budget the plan also recognizes individual and team efforts towards the achievement of superior results
the bonuses are directly linked to the objectives met in the performance appraisal process
the shortterm incentive plan aims to enhance the link between pay and performance by
  aligning the financial interests of employees with the annual financial performance of the company
  motivating employees to work towards common annual performance objectives and
  providing greater total cash compensation where superior individual and organizational results are met or exceeded

longterm incentive plan
the longterm incentive plan ltip was first implemented in 1998 originally it included the granting of stock options and was
subsequently amended to allow the board of directors to grant treasury restricted share units rsus and nontreasury rsus to officers
management and key employees of gildan and its subsidiaries the primary objective of the ltip is to encourage individuals to work
towards the longterm growth and development of the company
in addition the ltip assists gildan in attracting retaining and motivating its officers and key employees the ltip is administered by the
board of directors which has delegated the ltip responsibilities to the compensation and human resources committee
more specifically the ltip is designed to
  recognize and reward the impact of longerterm strategic actions undertaken by the management team and key employees
  align the interests of the management team key employees and shareholders
  help employees focus on developing and successfully implementing a continual growth strategy for gildan and
  foster employee retention

system gqs and with their specific job responsibilities the training also includes topics related to enabling workers to better
understand the environment in which they will be working as well as informing them of their rights and obligations

specific employee training requirements are identified at a later time through the performance appraisal process gildan continues to
assess how employee ratings as found on the performance appraisal tool evolve from one year to the next in doing so we have been
able to identify and build on our employees competencies help them increase their knowledge and heighten their awareness of the
principles of gildans code of conduct we have also been able to identify employees progress and take the necessary measures to
address the gaps between their actual performance and the desired performance scores

home  people  working conditions  health  safety
in line with our commitment to ensure our employees wellbeing and health occupational health and safety is a top priority at gildan it is
an integral part of our business practices as highlighted throughout our global health and safety policy as repetitive movements are an
inherent part of our manufacturing process and can lead to discomfort and possibly injuries gildan has implemented measures to
improve our ergonomic practices at all our facilities with a goal of mitigating worker discomfort and preventing workplace injuries

in 2008 gildan implemented an internal health and safety performance scorecard global safety scorecard in order to keep track of
workrelated injuries as well as their severity the scorecard covers all gildan owned facilities and contains data related to first aid
injuries losttime accidents musculoskeletal disorders lost work hours work days injury and severity rates

the injury and severity rate indicators are based on the occupational safety and health administration osha principles the injury rate
indicator is used to show how many accidents occurred in a 200000 hour work period while the severity rate indicator shows the gravity
of the accidents during the same amount of hours worked this severity rate is based on the number of lost days which is an indicator of
the severity of any accident

on a global scale 2014 saw a decrease in injury and severity rates down 26 and 27 respectively when compared to the previous year
injury and severity rates decreased by 48 and 46 respectively when compared to our 2010 baseline year the decrease in both rates
can be mainly attributed to the improvements achieved at the three facilities which were added in 2013 as part of the anvil acquisition as
well as our bangladesh facility increased efforts deployed in 2014 to improve employee awareness as well as the implementation of
preventive measures also contributed to this decrease

gildans health and safety policies and procedures have been fully integrated at the recently acquired new buffalo shirt factory facility

all gildan owned textile facilities have builtin fire safety systems such as sprinkler systems with the exception of our bangladesh facility
where a fire hose system is in place emergency exits and fire alarms among other safety items furthermore fire drills are performed at
least twice per year at all facilities

each job in the manufacturing and distribution operations has a job safety risk analysis which has been performed

in accordance with the ohsas 18000 standard this analysis identifies the critical safety aspects of each job this helps determine the
training experience and personal protective equipment ppe needed to safely perform the job

board of directors oversight of health and safety

employee health and safety is part of the agenda for the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors each
quarter the committee reviews and discusses the quarterly global safety scorecard reviews the overall company trends over the past
12 months compares the key metrics accident frequency rate and severity rate to industry averages and discusses important health
and safety topics such as reviewing any progress in regard to corrective action plans in certain facilities

the compensation and human resources committee sets the overall plan each fiscal year and prioritizes the areas of focus for
example if the company begins to operate with new equipment or technology in an area in which we have no expertise the committee
will ask for an analysis of best practices in this field and approve the approach most recently this occurred as part of the companys
further vertical integration into yarn spinning

each fiscal year health and safety targets are established for each of gildans global operations these targets are generally 1020
lower than the previous years results as we aim for continuous improvement management in each facility plant managers through
supervisor has employee health and safety as a large part of their annual operating objectives which determines their annual bonus in
addition vice presidents in manufacturing and distribution operations review safety with plant managers and the local safety
managercoordinator on a monthly basis to measure results and trends for each facility and discuss best practices from other locations

health  safety key performance indicator
to measure the performance of manufacturing facilities gildan has developed a health and safety indicator which consolidates three of
our most important safety programs accident prevention safety preventive observations and ergonomics some of the targets that are
evaluated within this program include number of recordable accidents safety awareness campaigns number of safety preventive
observations and implementation of ergonomic training plan and analysis of ergonomic risks among others depending on the results
obtained by each facility for each target an overall score is calculated
the health and safety indicator will be monitored on a quarterly basis to measure performance throughout the year



health and safety committees
formal health and safety committees composed of managers supervisors and production workers have been established at all gildan
owned facilities and many of our administration offices and distribution centers these committees meet once a month to discuss
preventive measures to be implemented at their corresponding location
the committees also review any health and safety accidents that may have occurred during the reviewed period and suggest
improvements to our health and safety programs these improvements are implemented by health and safety managers who are also
responsible for developing related procedures at our sewing and textile operations
health and safety committees are also responsible for performing employee training as well as carrying out regular fire and safety drills

as part of the due diligence process carried out prior to the acquisition of this facility gildan hired a usbased engineering firm to
perform a physical assessment of the property and its buildings as a result of their findings considerable resources were allocated to
reinforce the buildings structure with structural steel and reinforced concrete in addition presently our bangladesh building is currently
being audited by safety and loss prevention specialists on an annual basis
our employees health and safety continue to be of paramount importance to us in light of the tazreen fashions ltd and rana plaza
tragedies that occurred in bangladesh in recent years gildan remains confident that the actions undertaken in our bangladesh facility
ensure the health and safety of our employees
the facility has an emergency response brigade team which is comprised of 240 employees one recent fire drill at our facility in
bangladesh resulted in the successful evacuation of four floors of employees in a span of six minutes
in july 2014 gildan was also inspected under the accord program for electrical and fire safety and building structure safety in august

health care programs
in most of the countries in which we operate public and private healthcare programs are lacking to make up for the deficiencies in the
social security systems which includes access to medical care gildan physicians at each facility have analyzed public health tendencies
of common illnesses including influenza hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases dengue and conjunctivitis in the countries in
which we operate based on the findings gildan has implemented preventive programs for employees such as presentations bulletin
board postings brochures and loud speaker announcements
for instance at our facilities in central america and the caribbean basin we implemented a preventive program for respiratory illness
which is the main cause of illness in these regions due to their tropical climate in nicaragua during 2012 a preventive program was
implemented on leptospirosis since an increase in reported cases has been noted in the country

ergonomics program
safeguarding and improving the health and safety of our employees is a priority for gildan it is also an integral part of our business
practices repetitive movements are an inherent part of our manufacturing process and can lead to discomfort and possibly injuries
gildan has implemented measures to improve our ergonomic practices at all our facilities with a goal of mitigating worker discomfort and
preventing workplace injuries

in the textile and garment manufacturing industry subtle hazards such as exposure to repetitive movements and vibrations as well as
incorrect posture are the main risks in the development of musculoskeletal disorders msds when compared to other industries the
occurrence of other types of acute injuries illnesses and fatal accidents is very low it is important to also consider that there are other
nonoccupational components general health nonworkleisure play and physical daily living activities that also contribute to the
development and incidence of msds

in 2008 gildan began discussions with the ergonomic center of north carolina ecnc to partner in the development and implementation
of a threetofiveyear bestinclass ergonomics program for all our facilities the ecnc was selected as our partner due to their leading
reputation in ergonomic practices their rigorous standards and their extensive experience with large companies operating in the apparel
industry their specific mandate was to help gildan identify and troubleshoot ergonomic risks


developing the gildan ergonomics program
a senior ergonomist from the ecnc has been allocated to work with gildan to further develop our ergonomics program ecnc conducted
an initial assessment in honduras in may 2009 the initial assessment included a set of interviews with members of management and
workers a tour of four manufacturing facilities and a review of gildans current ergonomics program including all medical data available
the initial assessment carried out by the ecnc focused on thoroughly evaluating specific jobs and processes that are considered to pose
a higher risk of injury to gildan employees the ecnc drafted specific recommendations that address hazards that are commonly
associated with msds these recommendations have been implemented and are now part of gildans ergonomics program
the ergonomic culture maturity model ecmm rates competency in ergonomic practices the ecnc program provides a roadmap to help
companies transition from the lower levels of ergonomics implementation into worldclass status within periods of time ranging from
three to five years



summary of elements of ecmm and levels

  eight elements of the ecmm                                                           levels of implementation



     injury management                                                                    level 1 firefighting
     education and training                                                               level 2 reactive
     program compliance and audit                                                         level 3 compliance
     management leadership                                                                level 4 preventive

     plant ergonomics team
     risk assessment and hazard control
     prioritization and analysis



the matrix used by the ecnc includes the following key elements
  employee involvement and accountability to establish guidelines and implement a safety disciplinary policy which includes expectations
  regarding behaviours and participation
  management leadership to ensure resource availability and program measurement
  injury management to identify employees with early symptoms and to better track injury trends in order to identify root causes and mitigate
  risks
  education and training to support ergonomics awareness and specific training for employees at high risk
  program compliance and audit to implement all program components and audit performance
  plant ergonomics team to establish multidisciplinary teams to manage the program
  risk assessment and hazard control to apply controls to identified risks
  prioritization and analysis to react effectively to incidents

during 2014 gildans hosiery and sewing facilities in honduras achieved level 4  preventive level of the ecmm with the exception of
the former anvil facility which was acquired in 2012 and thus started the implementation later on currently at level 3  compliance
during the same year gildan provided training in ergonomic guidelines for more than 8000 of our employees textile facilities in
honduras are currently at level 3 with the exception of the former anvil textile facility but continue to improve in key ergonomic
elements and anticipate achieving level 4 of the ecmm in a short period of time
during 2014 gildans nicaraguan sewing facilities continued the implementation of our ergonomic program currently at level 3 
compliance with the exception of the former anvil sewing facility we continued to carry our activities of the preventive level level 4
specifically in elements related to training of employees medical prevention of work related injuries and hazard reduction during 2014
approximately 5700 employees were trained in nicaragua

in the dominican republic the ergonomic committees continue to meet on a regular basis and in 2014 over 1200 employees were
trained in ergonomics during this time the facilities started performing hazard analysis and controls exercises in order to meet the
requirements of level 3  compliance of the ecmm in 2015
in 2013 we also began implementing the ergonomics program at our verticallyintegrated facility in bangladesh so far ergonomics
exercises routinly take place twice a day in addition ergonomic mats have been provided to all standing employees and training on
working postures was also provided we expect this facility to achieve level 2  reactive of the ecmm  by the end of 2015
all facilities in central america now have a functional ergonomics committee responsible for risk analysis and the implementation
processes aimed at reducing potential injuries for our employees
once level 5 of the ecmm is implemented in gildans facilities our internal control systems will have the ability to efficiently identify root
causes for injuries based on observed symptoms and pathology on a practical level it signifies that gildan will be equipped to carry out
measures to to control hazards and mitigate risks affecting our employees



emphasizing the importance of ergonomics
as part of our commitment of implementing a bestinclass ergonomics program at our manufacturing facilities in honduras gildan also
partnered with the honduran maquila association the regional rehabilitation center and the ecnc to launch its new ergonomics exercise
program in february 2013 the updated program includes new exercise routines developed in collaboration with all of the partners in
2014 we completed the implementation of this new program at all our sewing facilities in honduras as well as on one of our sewing
facilities in nicaragua we expect to complete the implementation at the remaining sewing facilities in nicaragua in 2015 and the
dominican republic by 2016



gildans schools for back health a first in honduras
as part of our ongoing implementation of a worldclass ergonomics program and our commitment towards our employees health gildan
inaugurated three schools for back health in march of 2012 these schools were developed based on a program created by the honduran
social security institutes regional rehabilitation centre sixteen doctors and twentyfour nurses from gildans medical team were
certified as instructors to provide theoretical and practical sessions to employees
the goal of these sessions is to educate our employees on how to take care of their health in order to prevent back injuries thus improving
their overall quality of life instruction is carried out in a series of 10 training sessions that include exercises that contribute to the
reduction of back pain back injury relapses and workrelated medical leaves
one of the schools for back health is located at our rio nance 4 hosiery facility in choloma it services employees at our entire río nance
manufacturing complex the second school is located at gildans largest sewing facility in san miguel our third school is located at our
villanueva sewing facility based on the success of the first three schools gildan is evaluating the possibility of opening additional schools
at other company locations
a medical screening process conducted by our doctors will be used to select employees who will participate in this program
gildan is the first company in honduras to implement such a program
as of september 2014 over 300 employees have participated in the 60 sessions offered by our schools for back health
as a result of the success of gildans schools for back health we also developed a school for shoulder health it was first implemented at
one of one of our sewing facilities in honduras a total of 8 doctors and 9 nurses were trained in order to become certified as instructors
gildan recently launched the program by providing the first 2 training sessions where a total of 13 employees attended the school for

first anthropometric study in central america
in 2012 gildan developed the first anthropometric study in central america anthropometry is the study of the measurements and
proportions of the human body anthropometry is an important element in ergonomics as it allows workstations to be designed to better
accommodate a broader range of the general population working together with the physiology department in the faculty of medical
sciences of the national university of honduras unah a sample of more than 400 people was randomly selected from our textile and
sewing operations all participants voluntarily agreed to be part of the study as part of the study fiftysix different anthropometric
variables were measured and twenty doctors were trained in the basic elements of anthropometry characteristics of the instruments
used and measurement conditions and common errors two training sessions were offered and six doctors were finally selected to carry
out the study
the study which is widely used in developed countries provides the average measurements and average proportions of the human body
for the general honduran population this study allows gildan and the industry in general in central america to work with industrial
manufacturers so that future manufacturing equipment can be better designed to adapt to the workers in the region the results of the
study are currently being used in pilot tests to improve the adjustability of two employee workstations
the implementation of the standards set in this study will contribute towards improving our workers quality of life gildan contributed over
6000 toward the realisation of this project
on march 25th 2014 gildan made a 20 minute presentation of its first anthropometric study in the 17th annual applied ergonomics
conference in orlando florida
in may 2014 gildan presented the results of the first national anthropometric study entitled anthropometric characterization and health
of workers in the north coast of honduras during a small ceremony in tegucigalpa the study was sponsored by gildan and developed in

our employees



focus on health  wellness in the united states
as we continued to focus on wellness in 2014 our us locations were encouraged to continue events from previous years that were
successful through employee engagement as well as adding exciting events that offered fresh new opportunities to learn about personal
wellness
a much anticipated health fair was held at our yarn spinning facility located in cedartown georgia this fair again offered onsite
biometric screenings blood pressure checks and the opportunity to speak with local providers regarding medical dental vision and
chiropractic care
in charleston south carolina a very successful health fair was also organized this fair offered gildan employees onsite access to in
network medical dental and vision providers as well as other disciplines covered by our group health plan employees were encouraged
to engage in conversations with over 20 vendors to explore potential offerings regarding wellness assessmentsvisits at no additional
cost
in eden north carolina employees were engaged in a number of wellness activities including a march of dimes walk a get fit eden
wellness campaign and a weight loss contest
gildans inaugural us wellness medical discount program was very successful over 93 of employees and included spouses those
participating in our group health insurance plan voluntarily agreed to receive an annualroutine physical prior to the deadline and
provide documentation of this visit employees who provided valid proof of their visit were able to save 20biweekly on their coverage
while those employees whose insurance plan covers their spouses were eligible for a 40biweekly savings our goal for 2015 is to
achieve 97 participation
in 2015 we will continue to work closely with our insurance broker and group health providers to develop a comprehensive wellness
program based on statistical analysis of claims data based on this data we expect to be able to evaluate a wellness program targeting
high risk participants this may result in a future modification to our group health plan in order to encourage compliance with prescription
drug regimens in an effort to decrease overall costs we will also continue to provide onsite flu clinics at all us locations offering
employees free flu vaccinations and the added convenience of not having to make an appointment with an outside provider
onsite nurses
at our charleston south carolina facility our employees benefit from the presence of an onsite industrial nurse as an integral part of
gildans health and safety program this nurse provides assistance with preemployment screening requirements assistance to
employees who are injured on the shop floor and suffer from other illnessesinjuries that may occur during the course of work in
addition the nurse works on safety policies and procedures the nurses contribution has resulted in a health care program which is
improved on several fronts health and safety awareness greater medical presence onsite preemployment screening onsite work
related injury assistance employee morale and reduced lost time from work
employees at our mebane north carolina distribution center have access to the services of an onsite nurse practitioner for eight hours
each week employees can consult the nurse to address their personal health concerns or receive a written prescription without leaving
the facility this program has not only reduced absenteeism but has also positively impacted the companys selffunded group health

the facility this program has not only reduced absenteeism but has also positively impacted the companys selffunded group health
plan as the cost of treating minor illnesses onsite is far less than a normal doctors office visit these services have also allowed us to
reduce overall year over year claims cost all current and newly hired employees are encouraged to participate in a voluntary
confidential health assessment conducted by the nurse practitioner as an alternative way to identify and treat any potential health risks
that may have gone undetected

grievance mechanisms
early identification of employeerelated issues is crucial to ensuring not only basic code of conduct compliance but also to creating an
engaging workplace by supporting effective and genuinely open lines of communication between managers and workers this is
accomplished at all of gildans administrative offices and manufacturing facilities through formal grievance mechanisms featuring

  open door policy to encourage any employee to contact management on any matter and receive immediate feedback
  employee management roundtables with clear deliverables and followup
     roundtables are organized by the management team and employees in order to identify best practices discuss grievances and to
     collectively develop an action plan for remediation
     provide immediate feedback to the employee
     the frequency of the roundtables varies according to the region monthly bimonthly or quarterly basis
  workermanagement committees
     several workermanagement committees have been created at our various locations in order to share opinions and help manage a
     variety of issues in the workplace
     in addition to the health and safety and ergonomics committees other committees have been established and meet monthly to
     discuss subjects including transportation cafeteria and environmental initiatives or to address specific issues in a particular facility
     or office
     the following are examples of committees that were created and of some of the excellent initiatives that have been developed as a
     result
        in honduras an environmental committee has been created to oversee all environmental activities at our textile complex such
        as recycling reforestation and circulation of educational bulletins
        in the dominican republic various committees were formed for employees from various shifts to work on opinion survey results
        and establish an action plan to work on identified areas of improvement
        in barbados a staff committee is responsible for planning staff activities it also acts as an information conduit for employees
        in bangladesh a workers participation committee comprised of workers and management representatives is in place the
        committee meets once every two months to discuss subjects presented by workers representatives
  suggestion boxes
     suggestion boxes located on the production floor and in cafeterias at every manufacturing facility in central america the caribbean
     basin and bangladesh are one of the grievance mechanisms used by the employees to report their concerns this year suggestions
     boxes will be implemented in the production areas of gildan apparel canada our most recent acquisition formerly known as doris
     written messages from the boxes are collected every other week by a regional employee who is independent from the facility
     management
in honduras close to 3000 suggestions were received in 2014 the majority of the concerns included issues related to the cafeteria
middle management and human resources matters all of which could be resolved through the human resources offices

in the dominican republic we received close to 400 suggestions related to cafeteria human resources issues and services as well as
middle management issues

in bangladesh close to 120 suggestions were received which related to cafeteria services and middle management issues

in barbados suggestion boxes are located on all floors in all buildings employee suggestions from the boxes are collected on a regular
basis and addressed at the quarterly staff meetings

we have seen an increase in the past few years regarding the number of suggestions received we attribute this increase to the various
activities that have been done to promote grievance mechanisms to employees

for instance over the years many successful programs have been initiated based on employee suggestions originating from these
suggestion boxes these suggestions have included the implementation of the cooperatives program at the rio nance facilities in
honduras the construction of a covered parking area for motorcycles at san miguel the establishment of the green committee in
barbados and the installation of two atm machines inside the facility in bangladesh for easy payments of employee compensation

we also believe that since all suggestions are addressed and that employees receive feedback on their ideas there has been an increase
in suggestion over the years

  tollfree integrity and social responsibility hotline and website link
     a tollfree integrity and social responsibility hotline is available 24 hours a day seven days a week enabling gildan employees to
     anonymously andor confidentially report concerns in english french spanish creole and bengali
     this hotline is part of our whistle blowing policy launched in 2004 and is used as a tool for reporting alleged violations of the gildan
     code of conduct and code of ethics and anticorruption policy and compliance program
     the hotline is tested annually by the companys internal audit department
in 2014 we received a total of fourteen calls related to human resources issues and more precisely to labour issues and workplace
conduct every complaint has been investigated and followed up by the employee concerns and questionable acts committee at the
companys head office

each one of the reported complaints is investigated and followed up by management teams or if submitted through the hotline by the
employee concerns and questionable acts committee if senior management is involved in the complaint the board of directors is
consulted during audits at all of our third party contractor facilities we also verify that grievance mechanisms are effectively in place

in 2014 we trained employees from our recently acquired new buffalo facility in honduras on our grievance mechanisms and hotline

we also introduced the hotline and code of conduct and code of ethics to the employees at our recently acquired manufacturing facility

in canada in 2015 more detailed training will be provided to all employees in these locations


using creativity to promote grievance mechanisms
as part of the induction training provided for new employees at gildan we proactively advertise our available grievance mechanisms in
addition specific training on their use is provided colourful posters promoting the integrity and social responsibility hotline are also in
common areas on all our facilities and offices
in 2014 the newly acquired new buffalo shirt factory facility in honduras was included in the review process used by the interdisciplinary
grievance mechanisms committee the referenced committee was originally established in 2012 and its primary function is to review all
of the issues raised by all facilities and to ensure that employee concerns are appropriately addressed this information is then shared
with directors and vice presidents

facility closures and downsizing
2014 was a year of global growth for gildan during the year we increased our manufacturing capacity through the development of new
textile sewing and yarnspinning facilities there were no facility closures in 2014

our number of employees grew by approximately 10000 over the course of 2014 our total headcount at the end of 2014 was 43323
employees

specific highlights include the following

  during the 20132014 period gildan significantly invested in its yarnspinning operations in the united states including the
  development of a new yarnspinning facility in salisbury nc and the construction of two new additional yarnspinning facilities in nc
  salisbury and mocksville
  once fully rampedup these three facilities will contribute to creating approximately 700 new jobs in the united states
  in 2014 gildan inaugurated a sewing facility in san pedro de macorís in the dominican republic thus creating more than 1500 jobs in
  the region
  in 2014 we inaugurated a new distribution center in honduras at our rio nance complex
  in 2014 we also acquired doris inc doris a leading marketer and manufacturer of branded sheer hosiery legwear and shapewear
  products to retailers in canada and the united states which operates a manufacturing facility and distribution center in canada

home  people  working conditions  unions
gildans code of conduct and management team support the rights of workers to freedom of association gildan is currently working on a
collaborative basis with various unions the company fully recognizes an employees right to form or join any organization or association
of their choosing including a union and their right to engage in collective bargaining with the company approximately 9000 of our
employees are currently represented by unions worldwide in addition close to 8000 18 of our employees are governed by a
collective bargaining agreement in place between the union and the corresponding facilities


dominican republic
during 2013 our textile facility in the dominican republic continued working in a collaborative and constructive manner with the
sitragildan union despite the absence of a collective bargaining agreement due to the ongoing litigation as previously mentioned in our
2012 report an order from the supreme court of the dominican republic is preventing the company from signing the collective
bargaining agreement between the two parties the supreme court judgment stems from a lawsuit filed by a second competing union
sitragil and appoints the labor court of santo domingo to make a determination as to which of the two unions if any represents the
majority of the workers at our dominican republic textile facility
notwithstanding the ongoing litigation the company unilaterally implemented all economic benefits to the workers and will continue to
provide the agreed upon employee benefits we consider this matter to be effectively resolved with both sitragildan and ngos and are
awaiting the final ruling from the courts of the dominican republic with respect to union representation at our facility



central america
at the star sewing facility in honduras a constructive dialogue between the union and management has been maintained during the
year and regular monthly meetings have been conducted a new cba which was satisfactorily negotiated in 2014 will be in place during
2014 and 2015
management and union representatives also satisfactorily renewed the cba in place at annic a sewing facility in nicaragua which will be
in place during 2014 and 2015
a cba was also negotiated at our two other sewing facilities in nicaragua rivas and san marcos and will also be in place during 2014
and 2015
regarding the worker rights consortium wrc report on our villanueva sewing facility in honduras at the beginning of april 2013 our
villanueva facility started experiencing a shortage in its production volume due to a downward change in the market demand which
resulted in the elimination of two specific garment styles from the production process in these instances gildans approach is to maintain
the employment levels at the impacted facility to the greatest extent possible and for the longest period possible despite the absence of
sufficient production to support the total number of employees unfortunately the facility was not able to maintain the same employment
levels over the longterm and made the difficult decision to lay off a number of workers from all areas of the facility in order to correctly
balance the production lines a total of approximately 300 employees left the villanueva facility between may and june 2013
the wrcs position on this unfortunate situation is that 20 individuals were terminated for freedom of association actions although all
impacted workers at the villanueva facility were laid off because of operational factors and in order to maintain a constructive ongoing
relationship and dialogue gildan committed to rehire the 20 individuals identified by the wrc gildan is committed to respecting
workers rights and international labour standards and approximately 10000 of our employees are currently represented by unions
worldwide these fundamental principles are embedded in our code of conduct each of our contractual agreements with third party
contractors is conditional to compliance with our code of conduct and the labour laws in the country in which the supplier operates

acquisition due diligence and integration process
gildan continues to expand its presence in emerging markets as such the role of compliance during the due diligence and integration
process is crucial in order to ensure that we continue to make responsible acquisitions social and environmental risks are accounted for
during our due diligence process local environmental and labour laws regulatory compliance and compliance to gildans internal social
and environmental standards are also considered as part of our due diligence process
once a new acquisition is completed we work with the newly acquired company in order to help them meet our social and environmental
policies and compliance programs standards we do so by examining any gaps on their existing social and environmental policies and
compliance programs and helping them develop the corresponding action plans in order to implement any corrective actions in a timely
manner the main steps of the integration process are
  rolling out of the gildan code of conduct and employee awareness training
  training of auditors

performance of internal audits
in 2014 gildan completed the acquisition of doris a marketer and manufacturer of branded sheer hosiery legwear and shapewear
products to retailers in canada and the united states during the acquisition process we performed a detailed due diligence process that
included the review of past external social compliance audits conducted by their customers in addition to undertaking an environmental
due diligence process of our own
we expect to complete the full integration of the acquired doris operations to meet gildans social compliance standards by the end of
2015

home  people  social compliance  audits

fiscal 2014
gildans goal is to visit 100 of its manufacturing facilities this includes manufacturing facilities for third party contractors at least once
in an 18month period
audits are prioritized based on the evaluation of risk in 2014 81 of our manufacturing facilities were audited at least once by our
internal auditors or by third party auditors on gildans behalf the facilities that have not yet been audited will be visited before the end of
the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 this will ensure that all facilities have been visited at least once in an 18month period in addition
all new sourcing facilities have been audited prior to the start of any production for gildan for more information please refer to our
methodology section
in 2014 244 monitoring audits were performed this number also includes audits performed at third party contractor facilities that were
not retained for production
a total of 132 social compliance audits were conducted at gildan and third party contractor facilities in the united states asia central
america and the caribbean basin of these 80 audits were conducted by our internal auditors or by third party auditors on gildans
behalf 52 audits were conducted by external auditors for wrap the fla the ilo better work programme or by customers
furthermore 112 followup audits were conducted at gildan and contractor facilities of these 75 audits were conducted by our internal
auditors or by third party auditors on gildans behalf and 37 were conducted by external auditors for the ilo better work programme
in addition as part of the continuous improvement of our social compliance program and as a leading best practice in the second half of
fiscal 2014 we commenced the process of auditing key raw material suppliers during 2014 in total we completed the audit of five key
raw material suppliers the audits identified weaknesses in the areas of documentation of employee contracts and files excessive
overtime health and safety and environment
we are currently working with these suppliers in order to develop a remediation plan to address the findings as this is a new process and
a best in class standard we decided to not audit additional raw material suppliers in 2015 as we expect to achieve similar results to what
we saw in 2014
instead we have decided to focus our resources in assisting the raw material suppliers we audited in 2014 in implementing and executing
a proper remediation plan based on the success we achieve with this approach we will reevaluate how to best proceed in continuing
with such audits
in 2016


home  people  social compliance  findings
classification of social noncompliance

noncompliances are classified as

  major serious violation of gildans code of conduct other codes andor the law these violations result in a severe impact on
  individual rights andor physical safety remediation time frame immediate
  moderate negative impact on workers rights and safety noncritical remediation time frame up to two months depending on type
  of violation
  minor low risk issues where improvement is recommended as a best practice remediation time frame six months


2014 internal social compliance audit findings  gildan owned facilities
a total of 217 labourrelated noncompliances were found at gildan owned facilities during the 2014 internal audits noncompliances can
be classified as 1 major 05 131 moderate 604 and 85 391 minor this represents a decrease of 7 in the total number of
noncompliances when compared to the 2013 fiscal year audits
the majority of the 2014 noncompliances found approximately 78 are related to health and safety issues due to the fact that health
and safety issues are highly regulated a large portion of our assessment questionnaire 57  focuses on items of that nature 
the only major finding for any of our facilities in 2014 was related to verbal harassment a series of measures including disciplinary
actions were undertaken by the facilitys management in order to appropriately correct this issue
the majority of the findings at gildan owned facilities include
  record keeping issues eg incomplete employee contracts
  fire safety eg blocked aisles blocked electrical panels and improper housekeeping

     we have found that most of the noncompliances in this area are often linked to employee negligence gildan works toward improving
     compliance in this area through the use of bulletin boards and refresher training courses in addition to reiterating rules and procedures during
     health and safety committee meetings

  general cleanliness and sanitary conditions eg cafeteria hygiene and general upkeep and sanitation in facilities and bathrooms
  machine safety eg missing needle or eye guards safety lights on lifttrucks and other missing or faulty safety devices on machines

     retraining in these areas is important in order to increase employee awareness reiterating the essential nature of keeping safety devices
     operational on any equipment in order to to ensure operator safety

  chemical safety eg unlabelled containers

     for more details on this issue and its remediation please click here

in all of the abovementioned issues employee supervisor and management accountability and discipline are very important in order to
enforce established rules and procedures it is necessary to continually increase employee awareness which is why environment and
health and safety training are essential when an obvious case of negligence is observed supervisors must also apply progressive
disciplinary measures as a demonstration of their commitment to gildan values and safety practices
in every noncompliance case detailed remediation plans and where indicated indepth root cause analyses were implemented
we now have three years of data related to audit results in our corporate citizenship database as such reliable statistics are now
available to help us identify recurrent findings with this information a presentation was prepared for middle management and upper
management levels in order to share these results and discuss how we can improve and avoid their recurrence
audit results and findings were shared with textile and sewing management teams whose members committed to improving csr
practices in their respective facilities the corporate social responsibility department will share similar presentations including csr
expectations for 2015 with management to ensure the teams commitment to implementing best practices

2014 internal social compliance audit findings  manufacturing contractor
facilities
a total of 349 labourrelated noncompliances were found at our third party contractor facilities during 2014 noncompliances can be
classified as 13 major 163 moderate and 173 minor this represents a decrease of 35 in the total number of noncompliances when
compared to the 2013 fiscal year audits it is important to note that the total number of audits performed in 2014 was greater than those
performed in 2013 121 complete and followup internal audits at third party contractors in 2014 compared to 115 in 2013
the primary findings at contractor facilities in 2014 are as follows
  health and safety conditions eg fire safety
  excessive overtime eg employees working more than 60 hours on a weekly basis
  social security payments and
  inconsistencies between wages stipulated in the employment contract versus actual wages paid

81 of our contractor facilities have been audited at least once during a 12month period the findings reported include third party
contractors with whom we conducted business over the course of 2014 contractor facilities that have been audited but for which no
orders have been placed are not included in the numbers reported
our internal auditor teams work with the facilitys management in order to assist them with corrective action plans they also provide
advice and feedback on how to better address various issues the majority of our production needs are produced at our company owned
and operated facilities which has given us the experience to developed expertise on effective labour compliance management systems
policies and procedures we transfer this knowledge to our contractors management teams in order to ensure sustainable remediation
efforts and in order to better educate them on such matters
for more details on our capacity building initiatives at our contractor facilities please refer to our contractors and suppliers section

2014 information related to gri indicators hr4hr5hr6
gildans code of conduct establishes a minimum working age of 18 years this provision allows us to ensure that no employees under the
age of 18 are employed at any of our facilities as well as at the facilities of our contractors  even though in most countries it is legal to
work at age 15 or 16 under the ilo minimum age convention 1973 many restrictions apply to young workers for example young
workers are not allowed to perform hazardous duties or work at night ilo night work of young person industry convention 1919
according to our interpretation of the ilo convention on child labour we believe that it is appropriate to exclude young workers from our
facilities and have decided to set our minimum working age at 18 years
when we acquired our integrated facility in bangladesh in 2010 a country identified as having significant risk for child labour incidents as
it has not ratified ilo convention 138 on child labour we conducted a complete screening of employees to confirm that they were all
above the age of 18the use of child labour is continually monitored through our internal audits or audits conducted by third parties in
order to alleviate the risk of child labour incidents

gildan prohibits the use of forced or compulsory labour at its facilities one finding associated with compulsory labour was identified
through an internal audit at one of our third party contractors it was related to supervisors mandating employees to work overtime
refresher training regarding the maximum hours of work allowed as established on our code of conduct was provided to supervisors as a
corrective action in addition the company policies are being communicated through the facility loud speakers on a daily basis to ensure
employee awareness
regarding employees freedom of association we experienced two situations during the 2014 reporting period both instances were
found at two different third party contractors one was related to a statement found in the facilitys employee manual stating the adoption
of a nonunion business model the facilitys code of conduct as observed and posted in the facility and gildans code of conduct state
that they both recognize the right to employees to organize and bargain collectively this issue was discussed with the facilitys
management and the statement in the wording of the employee manual was changed to ensure no ambiguity with regards to the
employees right to associate freely and bargain collectively
in the second case it was found that an employees representative at a third party contractors facility had not been democratically
elected the issue was discussed with the facilitys management and a formal election took place in order to determine the employees
representative
for more details regarding freedom of association at gildan facilities please consult our unions section

home  people  social compliance  remediation
corrective actions are verified through followup audits and through the use of our internal corporate citizenship database facilities can
provide details on their corrective actions as well as provide evidence to supporting their remedial efforts the status of all non
compliances are reviewed and their corrective actions are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis

persistent or recurrent findings are given special attention in order to ensure proper remediation is implemented for these concerns as
well as assess whether a persistent pattern is developing in several facilities

in order to address recurrent issues identified in our 2014 audits key members of the management team from each facility were trained
in gildans root cause analysis process our root cause analysis procedure was revamped in 2014 management teams in our facilities are
now required to systematically identify the root causes of each of the noncompliances raised during the audit process the main
objective is to help prevent similar noncompliance issues from happening in the future this is done by having a system in place that
helps with the implementation and review of adequate preventive and corrective actions using this methodology

home  people  employee engagement programs
at gildan employee engagement is at the center of our human resources strategy we believe that an engaged workforce is one in which
employee performance and retention stand out employee engagement can be defined as the extent to which employees feel passionate
about their jobs are emotionally connected to the company for which they work and show commitment to the organization and their role
employee engagement is key for the betterment of any organization this is the reason why gildan in 2013 rolled out a global
engagement survey that measured employees emotional satisfaction and intellectual commitment to gildan

during the course of carrying out this engagement survey employees from the majority of our locations were invited to participate by
filing out a questionnaire which typically measures 3 key behaviors saying positive things about gildan staying within the organization
and striving to achieve above and beyond whats expected in their daytoday role extensive analyses of the results of this survey
highlighted the main strengths as well as main areas for opportunities in terms of employee engagement within gildan the 2013 survey
results showed high global scores relating to corporate social responsibility csr employer reputation sense of accomplishment
worklife balance and work tasks areas for improvement were also identified and have been currently addressed with concrete action
plans that include regular followups a second employee engagement survey will be conducted in 2015 this will allow us to continue to
measure our progress and continue to work on improving employees engagement and satisfaction at gildan

when individuals begin working at gildan they become a valued member of a larger family this is why we feel it is important for us to
develop and implement various programs to better communicate with our employees to support them in the many aspects of their lives 
professional family and personal  to encourage them to adopt a healthy and active lifestyle and to recognize and reward their unique
contribution to our company

at gildan we believe that such initiatives have the power to make a difference in improving our employees quality of life at work and at
home

here are a few examples of local initiatives


gildan tv
in 2009 the communications department in central america identified the need for a better and more efficient mean of communication
to our employees after conducting surveys across our facilities television was identified as the communication vehicle of preference by
our employees gildan tv was created in response to this survey and it has become a great tool to provide our employees with
information in an easytodigest attentiongrabbing manner
this closedcircuit tv system allows plant management to broadcast messages to employees through tv monitors which are located
throughout our textile and sewing plants as well as at our health clinics and cafeterias
the content that airs on gildan tv is mainly educational and is developed to strengthen awareness of the companys policies activities
employee success stories and community programs among other items
in line with the positive results of gildan tv in honduras this creative way of communicating information to employees was extended to
other locations as of 2012 the program is fully operational at our offices and facilities in barbados charleston and nicaragua at the
beginning of 2013 the program was launched at our corporate office in montreal as well
the human resources staff at each location is trained on gildan tv software management and programming in order for them to be
able to update the gildan tv content at each facility in addition to the communications team gildan tv content includes important
information specific to each facility
we now have gildan tv in all gildan facilities with the exception of 3 recently acquired facilities in honduras former anvil and new
buffalo shirt factory facilities where gildan tv will be implemented in 2015



cooperatives
our honduras and dominican republic sewing and textile facilities have formed independent cooperatives in order to provide an
incentive and to encourage employees to accumulate savings these cooperatives assist employees with greater access to loans which
can be difficult to obtain in these countries and at low interest rates compared with those available through standard banking channels
participation in these cooperatives is voluntary and may be terminated at any time
the cooperatives operate as independent legal entities supervised by an administrative manager all cooperatives are exclusively
available for nonmanagement employees who freely elect a board of directors among themselves on a biannual basis as the
cooperatives are located within our facilities the finance department and external auditors are mandated with ensuring they are properly
managed and operated in compliance with local regulations
in honduras approximately 16570 employees are affiliated with these cooperatives we are proud to report that in 2014 the
cooperatives granted more than us 7800000 in loans to employees from our textile and sewing facilities
in the dominican republic gildan is affiliated with an independent cooperative which operates at industrial free zone las americas to
offer this program to its employees
in 2014 our employees in that region received a total of over 9445 loans which amounted to over us 1900000



perfect attendance luncheon
our charleston office organized a perfect attendance luncheon in november to recognize gildans appreciation to the hourly nonexempt
employees who had a perfect attendance record during fiscal year 2014 regular attendance at work is an important part of the success

of our operations many employees go above and beyond to have a perfect attendance record throughout the year
a total of 29 employees were honoured for their perfect attendance of one two or three years each recipient was invited to the annual
perfect attendance luncheon and also received a 100 gift card for their hard work and dedication throughout the year



gildans saving our family program
gildans saving our family assistance program responds to the needs expressed by many of our employees who request support in
handling personal issues and family situations in a safe environment and nonconfrontational manner this program provides employees
with free access to confidential counseling conducted by a certified professional specialized in marriage and family affairs the saving
our family initiative has been in place at a number of our textile and hosiery facilities since 2009 and has fully extended to all gildan
honduras facilities and the dominican republic in 2014 the program offered more than 800 sessions for our employees in honduras and
close to 400 sessions in the dominican republic



recognition for supporting the arts
as part of our employee engagement activities gildan employees in honduras and their families were once again invited to be part of the
2014 christmas play organized by frances lynch director of quality and socks product design  development this time however the
maquila association of honduras ahm sponsored a special presentation of the play in order to recognize gildan for this initiative the
event was held on march 4th 2014 at the main theatre of san pedro sula and attending the event were the ahm special guests media

home  environment  energy
energy consumption is directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change gildans main sources of energy include biomass
bunker fuel and electricity bunker fuel and biomass are used primarily to heat water necessary for our dyeing and compacting process
and are classified as direct energy the balance of required energy comes from purchased electricity which is classified as indirect
energy our textile and hosiery facilities as well as our yarnspinning facilities in the united states account for a large part of the
electricity we use gildan has recently established the following reduction target reduce energy intensity resulting from our owned
operations by 20 by 2015 from our 2010 baseline

in 2014 we decreased energy intensity by 2 from our 2010 baseline however we are still confident that we can meet our target by
2015 through the implementation of new energy efficiency projects which we identified and which are further described below

in 2014 energy intensity gj per kg of products decreased by 6 across all gildan facilities this decrease is mostly attributed to the
expansion of our biomass steam generation system at our rio nance complex

gildan plans to achieve its 20 energy reduction target by continuing to implement energy efficiency projects energy reduction projects
include the installation of high efficiency steam absorption chillers which will run on steam that is produced by our biomass steam
generation expansion the expansion was completed in 2014 as the absorption chillers project fully ramps up at our honduras rio nance
complex we expect to see a significant reduction in energy use allowing gildan to use 100 of the supply demand of steam from the
biomass to chill water which was previously done by using purchased electricity

in 2014 the global energy consumption for all our facilities and offices including direct and indirect energy was approximately
6187582 gigajoules compared to 5554790 gigajoules in 2013

74 of the energy consumption was from direct sources distributed as follows

  biomass 53fuel oil 11
  natural gas 4
  liquified natural gas lng 3
  diesel 2

  26 of the energy consumption was from indirect purchased electricity sources
2014 saw the continued reduction of bunker fuel consumption 2014s reductions represent a 17 decrease from 2013 and a 70
decrease since 2010 this is largely attributed to the increased use of biomass as a replacement for bunker fuel

gildans numbers have been normalized according to an adjusted baseline to include mergers acquisitions and divestitures since 2010

home  environment  energy  renewable energy
like most manufacturing facilities in the countries in which we operate the energy source used by our plants has traditionally come from
fossil fuels particularly bunker oil fossil fuels have been the focus of much attention in recent years as they generate greenhouse gas
emissions which have a damaging effect on the environment thus contributing to global warming in addition fossil fuels are non
renewable and increasingly costly resources

gildan has now transitioned the majority of its steam generation plants from fossil fuels to biomass steam generation in central america
and in the caribbean basin

in the dominican republic the system substitutes fossil fuel with biomass such as agricultural residues and selected packaging and
production leftovers

in honduras the burning biomass consists of a variety of agroforestry residues  mainly african palm  cultivated crops harvested from
agricultural energy plantations and nonfossil industrial residues from gildans production processes

in 2014 53 of gildans total energy was powered from renewable sources


key benefits of the agricultural energy plantations biomass systems
  the dedicated energy crops plantations provide numerous and diversified jobs in urban and rural areas reducing migration flow to the cities
  the energy from plantationgrown biomass is considered a carbon neutral process therefore it does not contribute to global warming and climate
  change
  biomass crops combustion generates less ash than coal with the advantage that the generated ash can be used as organic soil fertilizer
  biomass crops contain very low levels of sulfur
  biomass crops are a local source of fuel independent of fluctuating oil prices their use in developing countries greatly reduces economic
  pressures resulting from oil derivatives and increases the countrys energy autonomy
  biomass is a reliable longterm fuel supply
  biomass supports the development of agroindustries for the production of renewable and clean energy

home  environment  energy 
energy efficiency projects
improving energy efficiency and thereby reducing our environmental impact remains a priority at all of our facilities

gildans current condensate return rates at all of its textile and hosiery facilities in central america and the caribbean basin are close to
90 and close to 70 at its bangladesh integrated facility which translates into substantial conservation of both energy and water
condensate is the liquid resulting after steam energy has been used in a heat transfer process condensate is warm water containing
chemical additives that can be reused to produce steam at just onethird of the cost of generating steam from fresh water and new
chemicals

much of the energy consumed in our processes is used to heat the water used in the fabric dyeing process several heat recuperation
systems have been incorporated into the condensate return loop boilers surface and bottom purges  used to clean solids accumulations
by using these heat recovery systems we are able to preheat water and have it available when required by our different processes thus
reducing the amount of steam needed to reach the process temperature this way gildan reduces its energy consumption costs and
engages in effective water conservation


gildans achievements in reducing various types of energy consumption
2014 achievements
  gildan installed hot water heat recovery systems with lint filtration at all of our textile facilities this project resulted in over 15700000 kwh
  annual savings in addition this process which filters the lint by using water also allowed us to reduce 6171452 m3 of water over a one year
  period furthermore the lint recuperated by the filtration system resulted in a reduction of up to 70 of all the solid material contained in the
  wastewater sent to the biotop lagoons for treatment this helps in improving the biotops efficiency in cleaning our facilities effluents
  we completed the expansion project for our biomass steam generation system at our honduras rio nance complex this system allows us to
  supply 100 of the steam required at all of our textile facilities in addition to providing the steam required for the air conditioning of our textile
  facilities this became possible because we replaced our current electrical chillers with high efficiency steam absorption chillers the new chillers
  run primarily on steam produced as a result of our biomass steam generation expansion we expect annual savings of approximately 40000000
  kwh however a more exact figure will be available at the end of 2015


past achievements
  hot water heating projects were completed at all of gildans textile and hosiery facilities in central america and the caribbean basin a similar
  project is planned at our bangladesh integrated facility for 2015 also noteworthy the bunker heating control system and condensate recovery
  process at our three textile facilities and two hosiery facilities in honduras have resulted in a savings of approximately 10000 gallons of bunker
  fuel per month
  exhaust heat recovery units have been installed at the top of each dryer at one of our hosiery facilities in honduras the captured heat is then
  recirculated back into the dryers thus saving energy and reducing dry times which improves throughput overall with this measure alone energy
  use has been reduced by 45 at this facility a similar project at one of our textile facilities also allowed us to reduce energy use by 10 at this
  facility
  for one of the stages of production we have changed from cold water use to hot water use at all of our textile and hosiery facilities in honduras
  thus reducing our bunker consumption by 200 gallons per day instead of filling the machines with water at a temperature of 25c to 30c and
  then heating that water to 80c with steam we now use water at a temperature of 45c to 50c and heat it to 80c which reduces the need for
  the use of steam
  at our san miguel sewing facility at one of our hosiery facilities and at our newest textile facility all in honduras and also at two of our sewing
  facilities in nicaragua the lighting system was changed from 75w lamps wattage originally installed in the facilities to 59w lamps this reduced
  our energy consumption without impacting workers vision safety or production quality
  skylights have been installed at our three textile facilities in honduras to improve the lighting of the facilities with natural light we also upgraded
  the lights at one of our textile facilities in honduras which has been put on photo cells control reducing the time that lighting is turned on we
  expect this upgrade to generate approximately 2400000 kwh in annual energy savings
  the vacuum system has been optimized at two of our hosiery facilities in order to reduce the pressure required during use this was achieved by
  closing up all unnecessary outlets in the vacuum system and has resulted in a total annual energy savings of approximately 688000 kwh

home  environment  water

water is consumed extensively in our dyeing process for this reason we are continually devising ways to minimize our water use and
enhance the quality of our wastewater effluent as well as aiming to recycle more water throughout the various stages of our
manufacturing processes in addition we are continuing to research programs designed to enable water recycling in 2012 gildan
established the following target related to water consumption reduce water intensity resulting from gildan owned operations by 10 by
2015 from our 2010 baseline since 2010 gildan has decreased its water intensity by 4

the main project that was identified in order to reduce our water consumption was the brine recovery system which would allow us to
recycle water and reuse it in our processes once this project is fully ramped up we expect to achieve a 400 m3 day reduction in water
consumption this would allow us to achieve our water reduction target by the end of 2015

for more details on this project please refer to our water efficiency section below


water consumption

global water consumption from all facilities and offices was approximately 20325080 m3 in 2014
based on the us environment protection agencys      best management practices for pollution prevention in the textile industry our
water consumption represents a good average for the textile industry gildan sources the vast majority of its water needs from wells 99
and only a small percentage is supplied by the city 1
the textile facilities consume 82 of gildans total water demands mostly as a result of our dyeing process
it is important to note that no water source is significantly affected by the withdrawal of water our withdrawal amounts are below 5 of
the annual average volume of any given body of water we do not withdraw water from any ramsarlisted wetlands or water bodies that
are recognized as being particularly sensitive
gildans numbers have been normalized according to an adjusted baseline to include mergers acquisitions and divestitures since 2010
for more details on the methodology used for the baseline adjustment please refer to our reporting section
the others category includes our water consumption from our administrative offices chemical production unit retail stores and
industrial park services




water efficiency
as demonstrated in the various life cycle assessments lcas that we have conducted in the past years water consumption and disposal
have significant environmental impacts we are continuing to focus our efforts on reducing water use
in 2013 we completed the construction of a brine recovery system at one of our textile facilities in honduras the purpose of this system
is to mechanically recover the salt from the dye house effluents that contain the highest concentration of salt the salt and water are then
reused in various stages of our dyeing process this system is now working and is able to transform dark effluent into transparent effluent

we are now evaluating the timeline for the implementation of such a system at our textile facility in the dominican republic
we are currently finishing the needed interconnection piping to the textile facilities in honduras to incorporate the recovered clear brine
through our centralized brine preparation station which is under construction by the end of 2015 we will start to recycle the water into
our processes and once fully operational we expect to save approximately 400 m3day of water at each of the facilities in which this
system is implemented should this system be efficient as expected we expect to reach our 10 water consumption reduction target

home  environment  emissions
through its various manufacturing processes gildan generates different types of air emissions and potential discharges into the
environment air emissions typically include but are not limited to greenhouse gases ghg while potential discharges into the
environment include wastewater and other chemicals through spills into the soil andor ground and surface water

gildan manages these emissions through detailed procedures contained in its environmental management system ems environmental
impacts due to air emissions and potential discharges into the environment are prevented and mitigated through the use of this system

home  environment  emissions  ghg emissions
the relationship between energy consumption and climate change has been widely recognized this new reality poses a number of
legislative physical and financial risks to our operations

gildan is committed to reducing its ghg emissions through energy conservation efforts we also aim to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels
by finding alternate sustainable energy sources and production processes this will not only reduce our environmental footprint it will
also lower costs and improve our operational efficiencies in 2012 gildan established the following target related to ghg emissions a
20 reduction in ghg emissions intensity resulting from our owned operations by 2015 when compared to our 2010 baseline since 2010
gildan has decreased its ghg emissions intensity by 45 in 2013 we achieved our 2015 ghg reduction goal ahead of schedule with a
32 reduction of ghg emissions intensity resulting from our owned operations per kg of product 20 reduction goal when compared to
our 2010 baseline in 2014 we continued to exceed our ghg goal by reducing ghg emissions by 45 when compared to the 2010
baseline we mainly attribute our continuous ghg emissions decrease to the gradual conversion from bunker fuel to biomass

at gildan we continually strive to establish more efficient processes in our operations we do so in an effort toward achieving the goals
set for our 20102015 period in the next year we will continue to work to set new energy waste water and ghg emissions reduction
goals for 2016 and beyond

gildans numbers have been normalized according to an adjusted baseline to include mergers acquisitions and divestitures since 2010
for more details on the methodology used for the baseline adjustment please refer to our reporting section




measuring ghg emissions
we have been measuring ghg emissions since 2006 at gildan owned facilities and offices gildan has also been participating in the
carbon disclosure project since 2008 concurrently we have concentrated our efforts on the implementation of energy efficiency projects
as well as renewable energy initiatives such as the biomass project in order to reduce our ghg emissions
in 2014 the global absolute ghg emissions from all facilities and offices including from both direct and indirect emissions were reduced

by 6 when compared to those of 2013 specifically in 2014 our absolute ghg emissions were measured at 299553 tco2eq compared
to 317108 tco2eq in 2013
     32  of these emissions were direct emissions
     68  were indirect emissions from purchased electricity
gildans ghg emissions intensity tons of co2eq per kg of products across all gildan facilities decreased by 21 when compared to 2013
direct ghg emissions originate primarily from
     purchased electricity
     combustion of fossil fuel used to generate electricity heat and steam transportation of raw materials and finished products and
    transportation for employees using gildan owned vehicles
     fugitive emissions mainly from the handling and use of refrigerants
each activity has a specific source of ghg emissions electricity represents the main source of emissions for all our operations bunker
fuel remains the second source despite the fact that we have converted a significant proportion to biomass
absolute indirect ghg emissions are generated at sources owned or controlled by other organizations with the use of purchased
electricity
the others category in the greenhouse gas emissions by process graph includes our ghg emissions from our administrative offices
chemical production unit retail stores and industrial park services

risks related to greenhouse gas emissions
our manufacturing plants generate air emissions which are controlled by the installation of specific chimneys and filters in 2014 the
environmental protection requirements with regards to the companys operations did not have a significant financial or operational
impact on our capital expenditures earnings and competitive position to manage gildans exposure to regulatory changes we continue
to work with our local management teams our teams are regularly informed of potential changes to regulations that might be instituted
by local governments this allows us to be proactive and to continue improving our processes and technologies
physical impacts related to climate change can affect individual facilities most of our facilities are located in geographic regions that are
exposed to the risk of and have experienced in the past hurricanes floods and earthquakes naturally such events could have a material
adverse impact on our business to manage the physical risks mentioned above gildan has built its facilities to withstand difficult climate
conditions and are above the 100 year flood lines
our facilities have been constructed on raised land using structural design and materials capable of resisting hurricanes in addition the
company is protected by an insurance policy that covers loss of assets and business interruption in the event of natural disasters such as
earthquakes hurricanes and floods our local management teams monitor climate conditions on a regular basis and adequate
emergency response plans are implemented at all sites in order to protect employees and assets in case such natural disasters occur

home  environment  emissions 
wastewater management
water is consumed extensively in our dyeing process as well as chemicals for this reason we have a strong interest and responsibility to
reduce the impact of water use associated with our processes as well as using chemicals that do not contain substances that are harmful
to humans or the environment we are continually devising ways to minimize our water use and enhance the quality of our wastewater
effluent as well as aiming to recycle more water throughout the various stages of our manufacturing processes in addition we are
continuing to research programs designed to enable water recycling


the gildan biotop system
gildan has created a highly efficient biological wastewater treatment system referred to as the biotop at its honduras and dominican
republic facilities the biotop system has been in use since the facilities inception in 2002
the purpose of the system is to treat wastewater through a series of lagoons the lagoons naturally stabilize the wastewaters ph gildans
biotop wastewater treatment process has yielded excellent results while maintaining an extremely rich ecosystem just beside our
production facilities some of the important advantages of gildans biotop over traditional chemical based treatment systems include
  bacteria virtually eliminate dyes and chemicals
  no additional chemicals are introduced into the system
  virtually no incremental energy is required to process the effluent
  no harm is done to the aquatic life in the receiving river and its ecosystem in fact several species of birds and fish have been spotted in the
  lagoons area
  water treated by this biological system is suitable for agricultural use in surrounding communities which in fact helps local farmers
  the system does not consume fossil fuels
  the 40day retention time in the system protects against sudden changes in production or accidental spills of dangerous liquids in the production
  process
  water entering the local ecosystem is free of all contaminants and is continuously monitored for compliance with local requirements
  the clean water is then released into a drainage channel that flows into the nearest river

wastewater sent for treatment to the biotop is monitored in accordance with the following indicators biological oxygen demand bod5
chemical oxygen demand cod ph total dissolved solids tds total suspended solid tss oxygen oil and grease temperature
coliform bacteria colour nitrogen kjeldahl nitrogen ammonia phosphorus detergents phenols sulfide and heavy metals gildan does
not discharge water into any protected rivers andor wetlands
strict controls are enforced on all the effluents discharged from our wastewater treatment plants each treatment facility is required to
meet the local discharge regulations in addition to gildans effluent corporate standards gildans corporate standards were created to
establish a baseline for all effluent discharged into the environment as a result of our production processes in all our facilities in
manufacturing operations located in countries where there is no specific regulation for the wastewater treatment or where the regulations
are very basic gildans manufacturing facilities are required to meet the stringent corporate standard
to develop this standard we carried out a benchmarking exercise in which the regulations of all the countries in which we currently
operate were compared in addition widelyaccepted international standards were also considered and in most cases the highest norms
were selected to become gildans corporate standard
the table presented below is an example of parameters we monitor at the point of discharge of various wastewater treatment systems
including our biotop locations effluent treatment plants etps and biological reactor for each of these parameters the table shows our
own corporate standard as well an average of our measurements for the 2014 year for all gildan wastewater treatment systems gildans
performance for each of the parameters listed was in compliance with gildans corporate standard with the exception total suspended
solids tss which slightly surpassed our corporate standard

use of a biological reactor to enhance the effluent treatment process
following the success of our biotop system gildan completed the construction of a new biological reactor for the treatment of the
effluents from our most recent textile facility rio nance v the new system began operations in december 2014
as part of our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint while continuing to maintain operational efficiency gildan
determined that biological oxidation represents an advantageous wastewater treatment process for the above referenced facility
biological oxidation provides effective wastewater treatment at a low operational cost the biological reactor will work in tandem with the
biotop system in order to guarantee a continuous and safe wastewater treatment system gildans biological reactor represents an
additional environmental safeguard and socially responsible solution
when researching options for the new effluent treatment plant at this facility gildan sought for an optimal solution based on the following
criteria
  environmental friendliness as respect for the environment has been at the core of gildans operating procedures
  reliability the chosen system must run 247 and must comply with the latest environmental regulations at all times
  longlasting and leadingedge equipment from industry leaders is installed at gildan facilities this allows for maximum reliability for the
  continuous support of our production processes

the biological oxidation reactor chosen met the above criteria in addition since it does not require significant space this system
optimizes land use as it does not require a significant operating land footprint

home  environment  emissions  other emissions

inorganic air emissions
in 2014 our inorganic air pollutant emissions totaled 6545 tons a reduction of more than 8 595 tons when compared to 2013s
emissions sulfur dioxide so2 represents 56 of the total inorganic compound emissions while nitrogen oxide nox represents the
remaining 44
from 2010 to 2014 gildan has achieved a 67 decrease in so2 emissions gildans substitution of bunker fuel with biomass for the
boilers located at our textile facility in the dominican republic as well as at our hosiery and textile facilities in honduras have contributed
to the decrease of so2 emissions
bunker fuel primarily used for heat generation during the dyeing process and diesel fuel used by the generators to produce energy
when necessary are the two main contributors of our total inorganic air pollutant emissions
of note our nitrogen oxide nox emissions exhibited a 4 increase in 2014 when compared with 2013s emissions 2856 tons vs 2738
tons this small increase was caused by the rise of diesel consumption at the integrated facility in bangladesh since 2010 gildan
achieved a 31 decrease in nox emissions




inventory of ozone depleting substances
gildan is committed to taking proactive measures towards the elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfcs in our processes to this
end gildan conducted its first inventory of ozone depleting substances ods in 2010
this action allowed us to identify that hcfc22 refrigerant also known as r22 is the most common ods found in our facilities r22 is
primarily used in our oldest air conditioning units in 2014 our ods inventory saw an decrease of 2 32 to 30 when compared to
2013 the observed decrease was due to the continuous effort of gildan in order to minimize the use of ods in our facilities
gildan is committed to minimizing the use of synthetic refrigerants such as the r22 refrigerant these types of refrigerants will not be
used in any of our new installations natural refrigerants will be the preferred alternative for all new refrigeration equipment hcfcs in
existing equipment are being phased out when refilling becomes necessary based on this policy going forward all refrigerant replaced
in all our existing installations will no longer contain hcfcs


home  environment  waste
at gildan one of our key objectives with regards to environmental sustainability is waste reduction through recycling and the
establishment of waste prevention measures at all stages of the production cycle proper waste management is essential as gildan uses a
variety of materials in its processes and it is important to ensure materials are reused and recycled to the greatest extent possible and
the remainder is disposed of in a responsible manner waste minimization reuse and recycling activities are fundamental to gildans
operations

in 2012 gildan established the following target related to waste 20 reduction in waste sent to landfills resulting from our operations by
2015 when compared to our 2010 baseline since 2010 gildan has decreased its waste sent to landfill by 21 in 2013 we achieved our
2015 waste reduction goals ahead of schedule with a 25 decrease in waste sent to landfill from our owned operations 20 reduction
goal when compared to 2010 baselinein 2014 we continued to exceed our waste reduction goal by reducing waste sent to landfill by
21 when compared to the 2010 baseline

at gildan we continually strive to establish more efficient processes in our operations we do so in an effort toward achieving the goals
set for our 20102015 period in the next year we will continue to work to set new energy waste water and ghg emissions reduction
goals for 2016 and beyond

in 2014 we also managed to recycle or repurposed 90 of our total waste

we attribute the achievement of our waste to landfill reduction target to
   1 an increase in the  of recycled waste at our facilities this includes waste from the production area and at our cafeterias following an awareness campaign to recycle products used in our
      cafeterias
   2 an increase in the  of the recovered waste that we generate at the production area for example cardboard wood pallets and reels of yarn are used as biomass in our boilers

gildans waste management system was developed in 2007 and implemented over the course of 2008 and 2009 it is based on the 4rd
concept reduction reuse recycle recovery and disposal it consists in identifying and quantifying all waste by type and weight on a
monthly basis and ensuring effective waste management and control

implementing this waste management system involved several key steps representing best practices which were communicated to
supervisors and production staff at each of our owned facilities through comprehensive training sessions dedicated onsite
environmental staff support key steps of the program these include

  overview of waste classification
  processes for handling each type of waste
  sitespecific information for cafeteria office and facility waste reduction and streaming
  creation of additional facilities to store waste where necessary
  processes for documenting and reporting waste data
  identification of the impact our business has on the environment
  identification of opportunities to continue raising awareness and integrating waste management practices

gildans waste management system includes best practices designed and based on our own corporate standard they include at a
minimum legal requirements in the countries in which we operate

gildans numbers have been normalized according to an adjusted baseline to include mergers acquisitions and divestitures since
2010 for more details on the methodology used for the baseline adjustment please refer to our reporting section

the special waste category includes domestic batteries disposable and rechargeable batteries industrial batteries construction
renovation and demolition waste information and communications technology waste ict and fluorescent lights

home  environment  biodiversity
the number and diversity of vegetation and animal species constitute a key indicator in measuring the health of any ecosystem as they
ultimately influence the quality of life of the people living in or adjacent to this ecosystem

our environmental management system ems includes a biodiversity and soil use procedure which specifies that for every tree we cut
we plant ten when the need to cut a tree arises the facility must ensure that they have the environmental permit to do so in addition
each instance must be recorded along with the total number of trees planted to replace the trees cut

in 2014 only one tree was cut each year gildan voluntarily organises reforestation activities in many of the communities where our
facilities operate gildan also plants trees and shrubs outside of these organized employee led reforestation activities in 2014 gildan
planted more than 5300 trees along with over 2200 plants and shrubs through reforestation activities led by our employees thus going
well beyond its commitment to plant ten trees for each tree cut

since 2008 gildan has planted more than 36500 trees and 23000 shrubs


gildan employees making an environmental difference around the world
at gildan we are passionate about not only preserving but enhancing the environment in which we live and work with this philosophy in
mind we celebrate environmental events such as earth day and environment day at each of our facilities in central america and in the
caribbean basin
two main employee led reforestation activities took place in 2014 both involving the employees of our textile and sewing facilities in the
dominican republic the first included a group of 100 employees which planted 2600 trees in the community of bayaguana the second
took place at the san luis ecologic park where a total of 340 employees planted close to 4000 trees
additional reforestation activities have taken place in honduras and nicaragua during the first quarter of 2015 and will be reported as
part of our next update



biodiversity inventory
as part of our overall environmental impact assessments we conduct third party biodiversity inventories in the dominican republic and
honduras annual inventories are conducted in the dominican republic as it is a legal requirement in this country while biannual
inventories are conducted on a voluntary basis in honduras
dominican republic
the most recent biodiversity inventory in the dominican republic was performed in april 2014 it revealed an identical number of animal
species when compared to that of 2013 ie 45 species distributed in the following categories
  35 bird species
  5 reptile species
  1 amphibious species
  3 fish species
  1 mammalian species

the species were qualified based on their abundance in the area assessed 21 of the above species were found to be living in or around
the gildan biotop wastewater treatment system
our biodiversity inventory process confirms once again that the dominican republics national bird the cigua palmera dulus dominicus
a locally protected species continues to live and thrive in the environment of our biotop system
certain endangered species as classified according to the convention on international trade on endangered species of wild fauna and
flora were also found in the vicinity of our dominican republic facilities these species include the bluntheaded green treesnake
uromacer catesbyi and the turkey vulture cathartes aura the ruddy duck oxiura jamacensis also classified as an endangered
species vulnerable category was also reported to be living in close proximity to our facilities
the inventory also revealed the presence of the hispaniolan lizardcuckoo saurothera longirostris which is included in the international
union for conservation of nature iucn red list of threatened species
honduras
in october 2013 the second biannual inventory at our honduran manufacturing complex revealed a total of 61 animal species living in
or around the gildan biotop wastewater treatment plant the identified species include
  41 bird species an increase of 15 from 2011
  6 reptile species an increase of 3 from 2011
  5 amphibious species same as 2011
  8 macroinvertebrate species new species
  1 fish species new species

28 of the 41 bird species included in the inventory are part of the international union for conservation of nature iucn red list of
threatened species in the category minor preoccupation
the third biannual inventory at our honduran manufacturing complex is scheduled for 2015

higher standards


environmental expenditures
gildan incurs environmental expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations our own environmental policy and
to continue to improve our practices
the total environmental protection expenditures for 2014 were approximately 57 million this includes total operational costs including
the treatment of effluents biotop maintenance waste disposal and management emissions treatment spills cleanup and other
improvement initiatives
an example of one of our environmental investments for 2014 is the purchase of an emission particulate matter online monitoring system
for the larger biomass facility in honduras this monitoring system allows us to examine the emissions on a more frequent basis as well as
monitoring the impact of the biomass mix used on the subsequent emissions

home  environment  policies  procedures 
environmental code of practice
gildans environmental code of practice ecp was created in 2003 and since then has been integrated into all gildan operations and
thirdparty manufacturing contractors our ecp lists the allowable materials that can be used in our manufacturing processes  these
materials do not contain substances that are harmful to humans or the environment our raw material suppliers are required to adhere to
the stringent standards set forth by our environmental code of practice in addition our third party manufacturing contractors also must
ensure that all our products comply with the ecp

the ecp has multiple benefits

  it guarantees our customers that our products are clean and safe for their health
  it ensures a safe working environment for our employees
  it minimizes our environmental impact


raw material classification
gildan classifies any raw materials supplied by third party manufacturing contractors into three distinct categories
class i the raw materials supplied by third party manufacturing contractor meet gildans environmental code of practice they are
therefore approved for use in our manufacturing process from an environmental perspective
class ii gildans analysis results indicate that the raw material information provided for the goods to be supplied was insufficient for raw
materials supplied directly to our own facilities additional information is required from the supplier within a period of three months in
order to finalize analysis to determine if the raw materials are approved for inclusion in our manufacturing process for any third party
manufacturing contractors although the information provided is insufficient to finalize the comprehensive evaluation process sufficient
information is provided to start some level of production eg sampling and production testing the contractor is still required to provide
any missing information within a period of three months in order to finalize the evaluation
class iii materials are deemed unacceptable according to the terms of our environmental code of practice and are therefore rejected
these materials are not used in any of our manufacturing process a class iii classification is given to third party contractors who are
unable to provide the required information to complete the ecp evaluation process or are found to use materials and chemicals deemed
as unacceptable according to gildans ecp



embellishing our code improving our practice
as a reflection of our commitment to continuous improvement our environmental code of practice is regularly updated to include
chemicals related to the apparel sector which are newly banned or restricted by oekotex reach californias proposition 65 epa osha
the childrens safe products act from the washington state environment canada and the conflict mineral rule gildans ecp version 9
restricts the use of 1095 substances to facilitate the search for specific chemicals restricted by gildans ecp a restricted substances list
pdf  2136kb is included for easy reference the restricted substances list enumerates all substances that are restricted for use by
gildan and indicates the chemical category name and its reference number as listed in the chemical abstracts service cas
gildans ecp is progressively modified as the aforementioned regulations are revised to include new restricted chemicals these revisions
include new requirements for a wide range of product components that include cotton polyester yarn chemicals dyes solvents trims
accessories waistbands and elastics bags screenprinting activities service chemicals ozone depleting substances fluorinated
greenhouse gases and asbestos

home  environment  policies  procedures 
environmental management system
gildans environmental management system ems which is based on the iso 14001 standard tracks how gildans environment policy
and environmental procedures are being implemented across all of our facilities gildans ems is verified by internal audits conducted on
an annual basis the ems allows us to evaluate our procedures for managing water use wastewater discharges energy consumption
chemical handling and storage raw materials waste generation biodiversity protection emissions and spills control

as part of this ems each gildanowned facility has to set objectives and targets aligned with the corporate goals and targets in addition
each facility manager has environmental objectives linked to their compensation as an incentive for continuous improvement

home  environment  environmental compliance
at gildan we have devised a number of evaluation and verification methods to help ensure that we are compliant with all applicable
environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate in addition to our internal environmental policy our yearly
capital expenditures aim at achieving and improving our compliance with current environment standards in addition it demonstrates our
commitment to the environment and to the health and safety of our employees


environmental assessments
as part of its environmental management system gildan conducts a complete analysis of potential environmental risks that are specific
to the locations where we operate this analysis helps us prevent and address any adverse impact that our operations might create at the
location and in the surrounding community part of this analysis process includes carrying out of public consultations with members of the
community who are invited to address gildan representatives with any concerns that they might have concerning the technical aspects of
any proposed project

findings
2014 environmental noncompliances at gildan owned facilities
in 2014 18 complete and 18 followup environmental audits were performed at all our textile hosiery and sewing facilities in addition a
thirdparty environmental audit was also performed as part of the doris acquisition due diligence process
a total of 193 noncompliances were identified the noncompliances were classified as follows 2 major 1 66 moderate 34 and
125 minor 65 we experienced a 47 decrease in the total number of noncompliances for gildan owned facilities compared to 2013
one of the major noncompliances was found at one of our hosiery facilities in honduras where at the time of the audit walkthrough a
small gas leak in the generator area was noticed outside of the facility but there was no spill this noncompliance was raised as a major
issue since it is a recurrent noncompliance from previous audits which means that previously established procedures are not being well
followed the generators have since then been transferred inside the facility premises according to the environmental requirements
the other major noncompliance was found at one of our sewing facilities in honduras where at the time of the audit walkthrough three
instances of poor or nonexistent secondary spill containment were noticed this type of noncompliance is usually rated as a moderate
noncompliance but since in this case three instances were found it was raised as a major issue the three dikes for spill containment
were fixed by the maintenance department accordingly
the majority of the noncompliances found relate to internal policies and procedures
  legal requirements identification and documentation 18 lack of identification documentation and followup of legal requirements at some
  facilities
  general requirements 13 the scope of the environmental system regarding iso 14001 has not been defined for some facilities the iso 14001
  standard requires that we define the boundaries process andor departments where the environmental management system will be applicable
  document control 11 not all documentation has been controlled as required by the gildan quality system gqs
  waste management 9 some facilities require improvements regarding their waste classification and identification procedures as well as their
  waste storage warehouses
  emergency preparedness and response 8 emergency plans have not been consistently updated incomplete assessments of emergency plans
  and lack of emergency drills for specific situations spills gas leaks have been identified


home  environment  environmental compliance 
remediation
in order to address the noncompliances identified through our various environmental audits various remediation actions were initiated
in 2014 some of which are described below

  we have worked with local consultants in order to reinforce our process and documentation for the compliance of all legal
  requirements in each of the regions where we operate
  we worked closely with each of the facilities in order to establish the scope of the environmental management system as explained in
  the findings above
  we also worked closely with gildans quality system gqs team to integrate and align our environmental management system
  documentation with the gqs following specific guidelines of document and record control as required by the iso 14001 standard
  environmental workshops have been conducted in order to reinforce the knowledge of the environmental management system
  environmental audits have been executed with our waste management contractors in order to ensure they are complying with local
  and gildan corporate requirements
  we worked closely with each of the facilities to determine the best location for the waste warehouse the financial cost of establishing
  such a warehouse and the plan layout for such a warehouse

as child labour and forced labour have been identified in the
production of cotton from uzbekistan in 2012 gildan established a
process requiring all business partners to confirm by means of a
signed statement that they do not use or procure any cotton fibre
originating from uzbekistan in any supplies of yarn to our
organization or in the manufacturing of our products in 2013 we
also established a riskbased approach to identify yarn suppliers to
be assessed for the possibility of sourcing from uzbekistan these
assessments have been conducted since 2014 and the results will
be reported in the next report update

since 2009 gildan has proudly displayed the cotton usa mark on consumers product packaging and shipping materials this
internationally recognized mark licensed by the cotton council international symbolizes the inherent benefits that the us cotton industry
delivers by being a highly regulated crop
gildan has carefully selected to primarily use us cotton for the vast majority of its products we recognize the synergies between the us
industrys social environmental and agricultural programs and the core values of gildans genuine stewardship program
under the guidance of the usda the national cotton council ncc and various other organisations us cotton farmers have partnered
with industry and academia in order to develop and implement numerous agricultural conservation practices and technologies these
technologies have allowed to dramatically reduce their environmental footprint
seed varieties have increased production yields while lowering water land and energy and furthermore reducing the frequency and
intensity of chemical applications conservation agricultural practices and advanced soil monitoring systems have reduced soil erosion
and residual impacts on the environment gps positioning and advanced delivery systems allows farmers to be more efficient while
planting fertilizing and harvesting effectively allowing for a reduction in ghg emissions and environmental impacts on the land and
neighbouring ecosystems
us cotton farmers are required to adhere to strict us labour laws and regulations these regulations are most likely some of the most
stringent in the cotton growing industry globally they provide workers with ethical workplaces and because cotton is regulated as a food
crop workplace health and safety conditions mirror those of the vast majority of the foods we find on our tables
some us cotton facts
  the us cotton industry as a whole employs over 190000 employees whose farms output is valued in excess of 5 billion the economic impact of
  all parts of the us cotton industry are estimated to be in excess of 27 billion
  us cotton is regulated as a food crop as well as a fibre crop by us regulatory agencies usda usepa and fda it is therefore subject to the
  same rigorous environmental standards as food producers
  us cotton growers offer ethical and safe work environments respecting employee rights according to the laws and regulations as set forth under
  us law and osha
  us cotton is a drought and heattolerant crop with twothirds of a planted acreage requiring no supplemental irrigation in addition to rainfall
  twothirds of us growers use conservation tillage which saves about 907 million metric tons of soil per year and over one billion litres of tractor
  fuel conservation tillage is a method different than conventional tillage it reduces soil erosion and therefore nutrient loss it also increases the
  soils moisture and organic matter content
  us cotton is a net greenhouse gas ghg absorber more ghgs are absorbed in the fiber plants and soil than those ghgs emitted during the
  entire agricultural cycle field preparation through harvest

gildans position on uzbekistan cotton
the vast majority of the cotton used by gildan is produced in the united states notwithstanding this fact we require all our business
partners to confirm by means of a signed statement that they do not use or procure any cotton fibre originating from uzbekistan we
continue to work on improving the cotton traceability process for the cotton used for our products in 2013 gildan established a cotton
traceability assessment for a group of its cotton yarn suppliers in order to ensure that the cotton yarn or products they supplied did not
contain cotton originating from uzbekistan
the suppliers included in the assessment were selected according to several risk factors that include their proximity to uzbekistan and
the quantities of yarn purchased by gildan or third party contractors manufacturing our products these assessments have been
conducted by a third party since 2014
