social benefits since our establishment we have developed and executed our operations in accordance
with this principle throughout 2015 we carried out many projects in the fields of environmental
awareness social responsibility and corporate management in line with the principles of accountability
and transparency and with the mission of improving our position as a global leader in airport operations

were adopted as the guidelines of this report in order to provide a focused and meaningful
framework for our stakeholders

in 2015 tav continued its growth in three areas first we tried to increase revenues and the
profitability of our portfolio which covers 14 airport operations in seven countries second we pursued
new business opportunities throughout the world in order to enrich our portfolio together with our
integrated business model and solid collaborations that increase our competitiveness third our
service companies expanded our global footprint by undertaking operations and delivering services at
the airports which are not included in our portfolio

our business model is based on creating added value and innovative solutions in line with the
expectations and requirements of our passengers to offer them a safe rapid and comfortable travel
experience being aware that true customer satisfaction can only come with the happiness of our

commitments as part of these policies and practices in order to carry this commitment to a further
level we plan to sign the womens empowerment principles wep as well

we strive to increase the comfort of our
passengers
increased seating capacity
in line with the increasing number of flights and passengers at istanbul atatürk airport and to enable more
passengers to be able to sit at the same time we increased the number of seats in the international terminal
departures floor isolated hall by 20 percent

f checkin island construction
we also increased checkin capacity at istanbul atatürk airport to improve the service quality provided to
local passengers an additional checkin island was installed in addition to the seven islands already present
on the international terminal departures floor with the addition of 32 counters the total number of counters
increased from 224 to 256 at the international terminal which resulted in a capacity increase of 14 percent
as a result passenger passage times have been improved increasing our service quality

expansion of restro area
because of the increasing number of transfer passengers in recent years the air side of the international
terminal of istanbul atatürk airport has become busier than the land side therefore the restro area which
provides service on the departures floor of the international terminal on the land side was merged with air
side to create additional food  beverage court area

free wifi at the terminals
as a result of the increasing number of transfer passengers in particular as of 2015 we began providing
free wifi service in the atatürk airport domestic and international terminals as well as the general aviation
terminal for 15 minutes to passengers waiting on the air side we plan to increase the free wifi service to 2
hours in 2016

expansion of early baggage storage ebs area
in line with the increasing number of passengers at the international terminal of istanbul atatürk airport
the baggage claim and redistribution area for transfer passengers who will be waiting for more than 3 hours
was determined to be insufficient consequently the available ebs capacity of the baggage handling area
sorting area at the international terminal was increased from 1600 pieces of luggagehour to 3400 pieces
hour this improvement enabled early baggage within transfer passenger baggage to be stored accurately and
safely and be processed in a timely fashion

waiting hall for passengers requesting asylum
as a result of increasing number of passengers requesting asylum an area has been reserved for the
passengers who request international protection to wait until their processes are completed even though their
entrance to the country is denied reserving an area on the istanbul atatürk airport international terminal
arrivals floor for asylumseeking passengers whose requests for international protection have been denied
to wait until their processes are completed we have decreased the passenger traffic within the terminal and
increased the service quality at the inadmissible passenger hall

automation at passport control points
with the purpose of decreasing the time spent during passport control procedures and enable automation
egates have been installed at two desks at the passport control points located on both the arrivals and
departures floors serving only tav passport cardholders at the moment as a pilot project the number of
automated desks is planned to be increased automation during passport control processes reduces the
amount of time that people spend during passport procedures and increases the service quality offered to
passengers

we use natural resources efficiently

consuming natural resources without hindering the right of future generations to also utilize them is at the top
of our sustainability priorities to that end we manage the water cycle effectively carry out efficiency works
and inform our stakeholders about our performance

we are amongst the leading companies in terms of water
as part of the first water report published by cdp turkey under the auspices of the sabancı university
corporate governance forum tav was one of seven companies to prepare a report out of the 51 which were
invited to do so

we monitor water consumption according to drinkingusage irrigation and filling processes we measure the
consumption of water per passenger and periodically report to the senior management to analyze changes in
consumption considering the performance data acquired we create and carry out projects for the efficient
and reduced use of water

the total number of passengers welcomed at the airports covered by the report in 2015 increased by 76
percent around 6 million passengers compared to 2014 despite the increase in the number of passengers
water consumption per passenger decreased by 52 percent as a result of recycling and reuse works we
saved 28576 m3 of water at the airports covered by the report

waste water generated at our terminals is collected via closedcircuit sewage systems and transferred to
biological waste water treatment facilities within the airport premises all waste water discharged out of
our terminals is within the parameters set by laws and regulations and transmitted to the nearest collection
system or receiving environment in accordance with the related environmental legislation

we support recycling through waste
management practices

reducing the waste generation at the source recycling and disposal in such a way that will not threaten
public health comprises the fundamentals of our waste management strategy considering the increasing
number of passengers being served by the aviation industry in recent years it is not difficult to understand
the increasing importance of waste management accordingly we fully employ our responsible operation and
sustainability understanding in the execution of waste management

although the amount of total waste generated at our terminals has increased in recent years thanks to our
recycling projects we have achieved a better rate of reuse of that waste



we respect biodiversity

in order to protect the natural habitat through the regions in which we operate we pay the utmost attention to
preserve the biodiversity at our terminals and minimize the loss of natural habitat as part of the preservation
of biodiversity we use pesticides with reduced biological impacts for all kinds of undesirable species planting
additional flora and installing control mechanisms to avoid irreversible and permanent damage to the
ecosystem
