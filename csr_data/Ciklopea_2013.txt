    our contribution to the sustainable
    development of society
                   dear readers

                   there are various opinions and criteria for defining tradition
                   and one can certainly discuss the existence or nonexistence
                   of the traditional nonfinancial reporting of ciklopea we
                   are certainly glad that you will have the possibility to glance
                   at and read our report on social responsibility for the third
                   year in a row and we sincerely believe that our regular prac
                   tice of reporting becomes a tradition our report for this year
                   was again prepared in accordance with the g31 guidelines
                   of the global reporting initiative according to which it ranks
                   as a level c report in preparing the report we also followed
                   the requirements of iso 26000 as well as the ten princi
                   ples of the un global compact initiative in the field of human
                   rights labour environment and anticorruption

                   through the analysis of business data and publication of fi
                   nancial statements for the year 2012 we concluded that this
                   was yet another record year for ciklopea the increase in
                   demand for translation and localization of content to regional
                   languages was noticeable at the same time due to the pro
                   longed crisis and decline of economic activity economists
                   have been looking for new and innovative solutions in their
                   market approach and have recognised the globalisation of
                   content as one of the most rewarding and most effective so
                   lutions in the effort to reach new customers on the global
                   market ciklopeas team of employees promptly recog
                   nised these trends and adjusted our production capacities
                   accordingly whereas the figures show that our translation
                   capacities translated over 11 million words during the year
                   2012

                   during 2012 ciklopea continued the initiated process of
                   restructuring and reorganisation with a clearly defined objec
                   tive which is to successfully implement the mission and help
                   companies and institutions properly communicate ideas and
                   messages to their clients and targeted markets by providing
                   professional language services and nonlinguistic support
                   as well as to realise the vision and be recognised as the lead
                   ing provider of language services in the wider region of south
                   east europe

                   with this report we wish to share our values with those who
                   recognised us as a desirable partner associate or potential
                   place of work and we would be glad if you shared your im
