biomassbased plastic is a packaging material made from
renewable plantderived resources instead of exhaustible
fossil resources the absorption of atmospheric co2
during plant growth is estimated to offset any co2 emis

     toppan has been developing and commercializing
 packaging composed of biomassbased plastics since
 1991 including bioaxx a series of laminated packaging
 materials made from plantderived raw materials toppan

  countermeasures against disasters

  the toppan group takes comprehensive disasterpreparedness measures throughout the operational sites across japan under the basic plan for
  countermeasures against earthquake disasters the basic plan specifies that toppan employees are to 1 take safetyfirst actions based on the concept
   of respect for people 2 fulfill social responsibilities by maintaining steady supplies of products and services that society needs most and 3 cooperate
   with governments and communities to minimize damage and provide aid for affected people
       in fiscal 2016 the toppan group adopted a further practical approach to the possible occurrence of a widescale disaster based on the experience of
   responding to the earthquakes that struck kumamoto prefecture in april 2016 the group prepared two widescale disaster scenarios one hitting east
   ern japan and the other hitting western japan interoperationalsite drills were organized in march 2017 to enable staff in one region to verify the safety
   of all group employees across the areas potentially stricken by disasters in another region in conjunction with these drills toppan built a system for the
   head office to purchase supplies for groupwide deployment in the event of a disaster by confirming the current status of stockpiled emergency supplies
   in real time the head office site in akihabara and other main group sites also organize regular comprehensive disasterpreparedness drills to rehearse
   the actions to be taken during actual widescale disasters the initial damage assessment and safety verification the evacuation procedures the employ
   ees journeys back home from their workplaces on foot and the distribution of stockpiled supplies
       the regular repetition of these drills will keep all toppan employees on alert and provide them with the knowhow necessary for dealing with emergency
   situations quickly and properly
