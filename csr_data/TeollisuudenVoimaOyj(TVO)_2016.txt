  the section of responsible leadership in the corporate social responsibility 2015 report
  includes a review by the ceo a description of the operating environment strategic
  objectives the responsibility program risk management the management system and descriptions of business ethics




  review by the ceo
  it was a busy year in 2015 in olkiluoto as a result of our efforts we were able to reach a number of goals that we
  had set for ourselves our nuclear power plant is in good safe production condition and our large investment
  projects provide employment for our own personnel as well as for our equipment and service suppliers the olkiluoto
  3 project progressed towards the commissioning phase and we expect our new plant unit to produce electricity in a
  little over two years time having received a construction license from the finnish government posiva can now
  start the construction of a final disposal facility for spent fuel  the first of its kind in the world

                                       our industry is undergoing a radical change

                                       while our production operations are on a stable footing the energy
                                       industry is undergoing a substantial radical change the renewable
                                       electricity production support mechanisms and the resulting periodic
                                       overcapacity in the nordic electricity market have more than halved
                                       the market price of electricity in the course of a few years this
                                       development has undermined the profitability of the production of all
                                       base load power including nuclear power

                           the restoration of the functionality of the electricity market is essential to the industrys future and the
                           stable availability of electricity the decisionmakers are aware of the situation and plans are afoot
  both at the eu level and in finland to restore the integrity of the market we expect to see decisions promoting marketbased
  competition in the electricity market made before the end of the year the changes will take place slowly and despite the
  validity of the goals the restoration of the integrity of the market will probably take years

  we achieved a number of important goals

  in accordance with our strategy we have focused on essential matters and taken steps to improve our competitiveness and
  profitability our most important objectives include ensuring the high availability of our power plant completion of the ol3
  project customer orientation profitability and costefficiency and maintenance of growth opportunities

  all our operations and design solutions are based on safety our approach to the development of safety covers both the
  technological level and the level of behavior and attitudes  a culture of safety in other words

  in terms of availability the olkiluoto nuclear power plant had another good production year and the outlook for the future is
  stable we produced a total of 1426 terawatthours twh of electricity which equals 22 percent of finlands total electricity

  output and 17 percent of all electricity consumed in finland the combined load factor of the plant units while falling short of
  our best achievements was satisfactory at 927 we are already preparing for the 2018 operating license renewal by
  implementing plant modification projects in order to further improve the safety and reliability of the plant units

  we reached important milestones in the ol3 project the testing of ic equipment in plant conditions is now completed and
  the preoperational testing of operational systems has commenced in olkiluoto we now have a more detailed roadmap that
  will lead us towards the commissioning phase according to the schedule of the plant supplier arevasiemens ol3 will
  produce electricity in late 2018

  while we had to abandon the olkiluoto 4 project we will continue to maintain growth opportunities and our readiness to apply
  for a new decisioninprinciple when the time is right furthermore we seek growth through posiva a tvo group company
  currently preparing to provide nuclear power operators all over the world with services relating to the final disposal of spent
  fuel and simultaneously constructing a final disposal facility in olkiluoto for the spent fuel generated in the olkiluoto and
  loviisa power plants

  we have improved our profitability and costefficiency in many ways with our internal operating model revised in last
  spring and the organizational structure supporting it we aim to improve the efficiency of our operations olkiluoto saw the
  first ever cooperation negotiations in the companys history as a result of the negotiations the number of our personnel
  decreased by 42

  we asked for feedback and we received it

  tvo carefully listens to all its stakeholder groups and actively engages in interaction with them in order to get feedback we
  conducted surveys providing us with insights to the energy attitudes of our stakeholder groups their trust in tvo and the
  occupational satisfaction of our personnel

  according to our stakeholder group survey while concerns over the safety of nuclear power and the final disposal of spent
  fuel have diminished the issue that now raises concern is the competitiveness of nuclear power more and more people are
  supporting nuclear power for environmental reasons the visibility of tvos operations has improved further and the
  company has an excellent reputation among all its stakeholder groups according to the respondents tvo has also improved
  its performance with regard to responsibility and openness the companys primary strengths are perceived to be reliability
  and responsibility finnishness toplevel quality and environmental friendliness

  the substantial changes that we have gone through have also had an impact on our personnel and management taking into
  account the results of the personnel survey we have launched measures to further develop our corporate and management
  culture and clarify the companys strategy and operating culture according to the survey results the respondents feel that
  their immediate working community functions well and they are highly committed to it improvements have taken place in
  supervisor work and cooperation between the various units dedication to and perceived meaningfulness of ones work
  remain at a good level showing even a slight increase

  we develop our operations in a responsible manner

  tvo is committed to maintain and improve the responsibility of its operations through its corporate social responsibility
  policy and the responsibility program steering the implementation of the policy in order to improve the transparency of our

  operating environment
  the energy sector is in the midst of a rapidly started transition which may take several years the economic
  stagnation has led to a drop in demand on the other hand the electricity supply has increased since different
  subsidy mechanisms promote investments in renewable energy especially in wind power as a result the market
  price of electricity has significantly fallen at the same time the costs related to nuclear power have risen
  the development has led to a deterioration of the profitability of all base load power
  production including nuclear power in a short time about 2500 mw of electric power is
  phasing out in finland in sweden power companies have announced plans to close
  nuclear power plants before the end of their technical lifetime this may lead to power
  shortage especially during peak consumption

  the total consumption of electricity in finland in 2015 was 825 terawatt hours twh the
  consumption decreased by 11 percent compared to the previous year the share of net
  electricity imports was 198 percent 163 twh of the total consumption the amount of
  nuclear power generated in 2015 was 223 twh which accounted for 271 percent of the
  electricity procured

  in march parliament passed a bill to amend the finnish nuclear energy act and the radiation act the radiation and
  nuclear safety authority finland stuk received a wider mandate to issue binding regulations on the safe use of radiation
  the nuclear safety research fee collected from nuclear plant holders and the fees charged to licensees under their waste
  management obligation will be increased for a fixed term for tvo the fees charged will increase by approximately eur 2
  million per year over the period 20162020

  the program of prime minister juha sipiläs government was finalized at the end of may the governments objective
  includes replacing imported fossil fuelbased energy and achieving the 2020 climate objectives during the government term

  the commission released another communication on the electricity market and launched the related stakeholder consultation
  legislative initiatives are expected from the commission in 2016 one of the most important items to be decided will be the
  reform of the european electricity market model its main objective is to integrate renewable energy sources into the market
  and increase investments in intermittent production that supports flexible power generation

  in july the european commission published a proposal for new legislation to reform the eu emissions trading scheme over
  the long term the commission aims to improve the system so that in future the emissions trading scheme could be used as
  the primary control system to reach the climate objectives

  in october parliament enacted the legislative proposal to increase the maximum limit of power plant property tax the
  maximum property tax rate will increase from 285 per cent to 310 per cent starting from 2016

  in november the european commission initiated a consultation concerning the renewal of the nuclear power investment
  notification procedure which is based on articles 4144 of the euratom agreement according to the commission the
  present procedures are scattered and unclear from the perspective of the notifying party

  at the paris climate conference in december 2015 over 190 countries adopted the universal legally binding global climate
  agreement governments agreed a longterm goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees
  celsius and to aim to limit the increase to 15 degrees celsius countryspecific emission reduction targets are not
  considered binding each country can decide for itself the most appropriate means of reducing emissions

  significant climate and environmental benefits
  the climatefriendliness of nuclear powergenerated electricity makes tvo an important
  contributor to the mitigation of climate change and advocate of sustainable development
  while the level of tvos environmental management is already high we aim for the
  continual improvement of operations and a high level of environmental protection the
  production of electricity with nuclear power generates no greenhouse gas or particle
  emissions the most significant environmental impact of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is
  the thermal load on the sea caused by the cooling water it causes a minor increase in
  seawater temperature

  and water from the npp are very low mainly below one percent of the maximum permissible limits no accidents causing
  environmental damage occurred at the npp as an environmentally friendly power generation method nuclear power has a
  key role in mitigating climate change

  tvo is committed to the energy efficiency agreement of trades and industries energy efficiency measures are integrated
  into tvos usual operations such as the modification process and personnel development during the year under review
  tvo participated in the energy saving week tvo strives to procure products that are durable and have a long lifespan and
  to take into account opportunities for their recycling and potential reuse at the end of their service lives the companys
  procurement operations ensure safe competitive and reliable production and longterm operation of the plant units

  environmental surveys of the olkiluoto island were launched as early as in the 1970s and the state of the environment is
  continuously monitored surrounded by four nature conservation areas the small island of olkiluoto produces roughly one
  sixth of all electricity consumed in finland the concentration of energy production in a small geographic area minimizes
  environmental impacts and makes it possible to preserve other areas in their natural state

  employees are informed of environmental issues during their induction training for example all new employees at the

  annual outage with refueling and maintenance

  the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is constantly kept in good condition by alternating
  refueling and maintenance outages the annual outages that take place every spring at
  olkiluoto usually begin with a refueling outage where part of the uranium fuel is replaced
  and the necessary repairs and maintenance operations are carried out together with any
  preparatory work for the following years maintenance outage the refueling outage
  usually takes about one week
  the annual maintenance operations then continue with the maintenance outage of the
  other plant unit where major maintenance and modification work is carried out in addition
  to refueling the maintenance outage usually takes two to three weeks extensive
  modernization and reconditioning operations have been carried out during the
  maintenance outages at approximately fiveyear intervals
  the 2015 annual outages of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant took place from may 3 to
  june 5 2015 ol1 underwent a refueling outage of ten days and 13 hours and ol2 a
  maintenance outage of 17 days and 13 hours

  assessing occupational health and safety risks

  occupational health and safety risks are systematically assessed the assessment of risks is part of the proactive
  identification of dangers and it aims at continuous improvement of the occupational health and safety of all operations

  risks are assessed with the help of checklists including five sectors physical chemical and biological risks accident risks
  ergonomics and mental overload

  the key ohs risks identified at olkiluoto are unprotected openings live components work involving the risk of falling and
  moving machine parts a table including the key risks is maintained and the effects of corrective actions are monitored the
  table is also used as an aid when determining the annual actions needed to achieve the companylevel goals and objectives

  radiation safety
  in all their radiation protection activities tvo and its personnel are committed to following
  the alara as low as reasonably achievable principle according to the principle
  individual and collective radiation doses are kept as low as possible by practical measures

  the radiation doses of everyone working in the controlled area of the nuclear power plant
  are monitored and measured using dosimeters according to section 3 of the finnish
  government decree on radiation the radiation dose of a radiation worker may not exceed
  the average value of 20 msv per year during five consecutive years or the value of 50
  msv during any single year tvos own goals regarding individual annual doses are keeping
  the dose obtained by all olkiluoto employees from their work below 10 msv per year and
  keeping doses caused by internal contamination below 05 msv these goals have been achieved each employee working
  in the controlled area must take into account radiation protection issues relevant for their work the dose can be kept lower
  by using the correct working methods fullbody measurements are also carried out on radiation employees and local
  residents

  the radiation exposure of employees at olkiluoto has been low remaining clearly below the dose limits specified by the
  authorities in 2015 the total dose of employees working in conditions where radiation is present was 752 643 manmsv
  which is the fourth lowest annual dose since the plant units first years of operation a total dose of 614 514 manmsv was
  accumulated during the power plants annual outages which was also among the lowest ever recorded

  the combined radiation dose of tvos own personnel was 198 192 manmsv and that of external personnel was 554
  451 manmsv the highest individual annual dose incurred at the olkiluoto nuclear power plant was 79 77 msv the
  number of employees under dose monitoring was 2382 2434 with recorded doses accumulated for 888 845 employees
  the average annual radiation dose received by a person living in finland from other radiation sources is approximately 32
  msv

  environmental radiation safety at the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is continuously monitored with many different methods
  and through the cooperation of several parties tvo has installed four continuous radiation dose rate measurement points in
  the plant area and ten in the surrounding region these automatically report their results as well as any alarms to the
  olkiluoto plant units and to the radiation and nuclear safety authority stuk tvo has installed four air samplers and
  eleven dosimeters in the immediate vicinity of olkiluoto the sampler filters are analyzed for radioactivity every 14 weeks
  the dosimeter readings are read four times a year in addition to these tvo carries out extensive measurements two times
  a year and uses portable measurement equipment to perform workspecific radiation monitoring when necessary

  the people living in the environment of the nuclear power plant are invited once a year to fullbody radiation measurements
  carried out in olkiluoto by stuk tvo reports the results of the radiation safety monitoring carried out in the plant
  environment to environmental and radiation safety authorities

  in measurement conducted by stuk on the local residents no radioactive nuclides originating from the plant were detected
  one of the measured employees had an internal exposure in excess of the registration limit of 01 msv

  responsible value chain
  safe usage of nuclear fuel is assured at each phase of the value chain in tvos electricity
  production from responsible sourcing all the way to safe responsible final disposal

  shareholder and customer values and communal value can all be recognized from tvos
  value chain tvo creates value for its shareholders by producing safe and environmental
  friendly cost effectively electricity gained from olkiluoto has also customer value which
  benefits the shareholders finnish industry and energy companies whose ownership also includes 133 finnish
  municipalities tvo is producing 17  of the electricity consumed in finland and therefore acts as a significant promoter of
  finnish welfare in addition tvo and its subcontractors create work possibilities

  in addition to responsible electricity production high domestic content of the production as well as careful selection of
  subcontractors and partners are emphasized in the value chain

  the section of responsible value chain includes reviews on safe operations preparations for crisis and emergency
  situations research and development control of the nuclear fuel lifecycle nuclear waste management and final disposal

  safe operations

  safety culture
  the safe operation of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant is based on highquality power plant
  engineering the principle of continuous improvement highly capable and conscientious
  employees and independent external supervision tvos personnel are committed to a high
  standard of safety culture

  safety at the core of operations

  the nuclear energy act requires that the use of nuclear energy must be safe it shall not
  cause injury to people or damage to the environment or property the safe operation of the
  olkiluoto nuclear power plant is based on safe power plant engineering highly capable and conscientious employees and
  independent external supervision safety and the promotion thereof is a factor shared by the entire nuclear power industry
  safety is a special area of focus for nuclear power plants because the uranium fuel becomes highly radioactive during the
  power production process and continues to generate heat even after being removed from the reactor spent nuclear fuel is
  cooled in waterfilled pools as water also acts as an efficient radiation shield the olkiluoto power plant has abundant water
  reserves to ensure the cooling of both the fuel in the reactor and the spent fuel the plant also has multiple power supply
  backup systems for cooling water circulation systems

  nuclear safety and safe power plant engineering

  nuclear safety is developed by analyzing risks and by making provisions for them nuclear safety is always based on the
  valid and constant laws of physics
  nuclear power plants observe defenseindepth safety principles and deploy multiple release barriers the diverse and
  redundant safety systems reduce the probability of accidents
  the olkiluoto nuclear power plant has fourfold safety systems if one system fails the next one takes over an operator
  error or even several equipment failures cannot cause a serious accident
  tvo has implemented modifications at olkiluoto to improve the safety of the plant throughout its operating life new
  improvements will also be designed and implemented in the future

  competent and responsible personnel

  tvos entire personnel suppliers and subcontractors are committed to an uncompromising safety culture according to the
  safety culture all factors that affect the nuclear power plants safety receive attention in proportion to their significance and
  are given priority in decisionmaking continuous improvement and appropriate safety culture are inherent features of all day
  today work
  in daytoday work the safety culture refers to the star principle the star approach means that employees should
  always first stop and think and only then act and finally review whether everything went as it should have tvo
  encourages employees to report defects and aims to maintain a low threshold for such reporting
  safety culture principles

     follow the approved procedures and instructions without compromise

     make sure that you and others use safe working practices and work under safe conditions

     stop and think before you act and review the consequences of your actions

     report all problems and deficiencies without delay

     maintain an atmosphere where reporting can be done freely and without blame

     question practices and develop operations in the spirit of continuous development


  selfevaluations are carried out at tvo to examine the state of the safety culture based on these the state of the tvo
  safety culture is good however we have identified some development areas selfassessments have been completed every
  three years in compliance with the iaea guideline since 2004 tvo has completed the management system functionality and
  coverage assessments laid down in yvl guide a3 previously 14 every three years since 2009 several overlapping
  functions were identified during these assessments and these functions will be combined the first selfassessment in
  compliance with the new guideline will be completed in 2016 the assessment will be repeated every four years
  recommendations from the separate safety culture report published in early 2015 have been implemented on schedule the
  most important recommendation was the preparation of a safety culture program to achieve iaeas highest safety culture
  level ie to create a learning organization that realizes the principle of continuous improvement in its operations tvo
  prepared the program and the focus areas for 2016 are developing and expanding low level reporting creating systematic
  benchmarking operations and implementing the recommendations from external assessments of the operations particularly
  those by wano and iaea
  wano will complete a peer review in 2016 in a peer review a team of experts from other nuclear power plants
  approximately 20 people will audit tvos operations for three weeks and then issue recommendations on how the
  operations could be developed such a review will be completed every four years a peer review mainly focuses on the
  production operation of a npp and its maintenance furthermore wano has launched a new review system called
  corporate peer review it involves the management and administration of the organization the first corporate peer review of
  tvo will take place in 2016

  development of plant units
  safety  shared by the entire nuclear power industry

  tvos operations are subject to a license and supervision by the authorities the radiation
  and nuclear safety authority stuk supervises nuclear and radiation safety
  tvo is not alone in thinking about safety issues other nuclear power companies
  organizations research institutes and public authorities are looking for ways to develop the
  safety of nuclear power and safety culture at nuclear power plants for example wano
  supports the gathering of operating experiences and their utilization by its members
  tvo develops the olkiluoto nuclear power plant in accordance with the principle of continuous improvement modernization
  and modifications have been implemented throughout the plants lifetime and many improvements have been made to its
  safety features particular attention has been paid to ensuring the adequate cooling of spent fuel under all circumstances a
  severe accident management system that can prevent any major releases in the very unlikely case of a severe accident has
  also been installed to both plant units
  major modifications carried out in 2015 included improvements to electrical systems the main circulation pump
  reconstruction project reduction of dependence on sea water in the reactor core emergency cooling system and the
  ongoing emergency diesel generator replacement project these projects will continue in 2016
  tvo provides stuk with annual reports on all progress and measures tvos safety team regularly follows the associated
  projects
  the updating of official safety regulations was completed in 2013 and stuk published most of the regulations at the end of
  the year in 2015 stuk approved tvos suitability analysis of the new regulatory guides on nuclear safety as well as the
  proposed improvements and issued decisions on applying the guides at ol1 and ol2 plant units for the ol3 plant unit a
  suitability analysis will be prepared in 2015 and submitted to stuk in conjunction with the operating license application in
  2016
  the power plant is currently undergoing modifications with more in the planning stages the purpose of these modifications
  is to prepare for the renewal of the operating license of the plant units in 2018 the modifications will further improve the
  plants ability to survive various events caused by exceptional natural phenomena which in the worst case can involve the
  simultaneous loss of the operability of several plant units or safety systems also underway is a project to improve the
  companys safety culture and the related procedures
  tvo will replace the emergency diesel generators as part of an ongoing major modernization project the emergency diesel
  generators ensure the power supply of the plant in the possible but unlikely lossofpower situation the new emergency
  diesel generators have both seawater and air cooling systems the preparation of the emergency diesel replacement project
  began in the early 2000s and the project is the most extensive single plant modification project to ever have been carried
  out at olkiluoto tvo acquires the emergency diesel generators from wärtsilä finland oy the agreement on the delivery of
  emergency diesel generators and their auxiliary systems to the olkiluoto nuclear power plant was signed in may 2013 the
  implementation of the replacement project will begin in 2016 and is estimated to continue to 2020
  in 2015 tvo signed a contract with westinghouse electric sweden wse on the replacement of the main circulation pumps
  of olkiluoto 1 and 2 covering a total of 12 main circulation pumps the project costs exceed eur 40 million the
  replacement of the main circulation pumps is one of the most significant modernization efforts in the history of tvo the
  current pumps have been in operation for 35 years their replacement will further improve plant response during operating
  transients and help ensure that the safe and reliable operation of the plant units can continue in the future

  safe operations

  exceptional situations
  the events that take place at a nuclear power plant are classified on the international ines
  scale according to their degree of severity the ines scale has seven categories of
  severity category 47 events are classified as accidents category 13 events as
  incidents or anomalies with a negative effect on safety and category 0 events as
  deviations with no significance for safety

  in 2015 tvo provided ines ratings for six events of these events five were rated at severity level 0 on the ines scale no
  significance to nuclear or radiation safety and one was rated at severity level 1 anomaly an exceptional event affecting
  safety httpwwwtvofinews1667 tvo publishes all ines rated severity level 1 or higher events in the news section of
  its website and also provides internal communications on all events tvo processes all operational events that take place at
  the olkiluoto nuclear power plant and follows the events at other nuclear facilities around the world operations are
  continuously developed based on the observations made of such events

  various human factors relating to modifications communication and other similar matters have been identified by tvo as
  the cause of the most recent events necessary changes are implemented based on the assessments to further develop the
  procedures

  tvo regularly carries out emergency preparedness drills either independently or in cooperation with the authorities in
  november 2015 an emergency preparedness drill took place in olkiluoto to practice cooperation and communication with the
  authorities

  tvo submits separate casespecific reports to stuk for any special events and operating transients when necessary

  management of the nuclear fuel life cycle

  production  supply  and value chain
  the safe use of nuclear fuel is ensured at all stages of tvos electricity production value
  chain from the responsible procurement of uranium to the safe final disposal of spent
  nuclear fuel
  tvos production chain covers the generation of electricity at the olkiluoto nuclear power
  plant and the conduction of the electricity into the national grid that distributes the electricity
  to consumers tvos supply chain covers all functions structures and operators from the
  raw material sources to the consumers of electricity major sections of the supply chain
  include the procurement and manufacture of the fuel other procurement operations
  generation and delivery of electricity and nuclear waste management and the final deposit
  of spent nuclear fuel
  tvos supply chain begins with uranium the fuel of nuclear power plants uranium is a fairly
  common weakly radioactive element with a naturally low radiation level half of the worlds
  uranium comes from traditional mining operations which are either open pits or underground mines and slightly less than half
  is produced by insitu leaching a minor volume of uranium is obtained as a byproduct in the production of copper gold and
  phosphates uranium has been classified as a sensitive material and strict supervision by the authorities is a basic
  prerequisite for the utilization of nuclear energy the supervision operations are based on the european atomic energy
  community euratom treaty as a national authority the radiation and nuclear safety authority stuk supervises
  operators and licensees as defined in the finnish nuclear energy act
  nuclear power plant units ol1 and ol2 are boiling water reactors that require a total of 40 tonnes of lowenriched fuel
  uranium as the raw material for their fuel each year the volume corresponds to approximately 300 tonnes of natural
  uranium in the fuel assemblies used at tvos nuclear power plant units the uranium is in the form of ceramic uranium
  dioxide uo2 in the pressure vessel of the plant unit water passes through the fuel assemblies of the reactor core and
  boils into steam saturated steam flows through the pressure vessels steam separator and steam dryer into the main steam
  lines and to the high pressure turbine further to the reheaters and finally to low pressure turbines a shaft connects the
  turbines to the generator that produces electricity for the national grid one power plant unit at olkiluoto produces about 7
  twh or 7 billion kwh of electricity per year while consuming about 20 tonnes of uranium fuel
  the acquisition of uranium and other products and services nuclear waste management and final disposal operations are
  described later under separate sections of the 2015 report
  tvo produces electricity for its shareholders at cost price this allows utilities and consumers of various sizes to participate
  in major investments such as nuclear power plants and to benefit from the advantages of largescale production
  shareholders cover all of tvos operating costs and in return receive electricity produced by tvo prorata to their
  shareholdership the shareholders consume the power themselves or sell it on to third parties even though tvos
  operations only cover the production of electricity for its shareholders the company carries responsibility for the entire fuel
  lifecycle from uranium mining to the final disposal of spent fuel the supply chain covers the flow of materials information
  and money the material flows are described in the 2015 environmental report and the financial aspects under the section
  discussing the companys economic impacts
                                                                              in the value chain the production and supply chain operators add their own
                                                                              value to the chain tvos value chain includes shareholder and customer
                                                                              values as well as social value among others
                                                tvo creates value to its shareholders through the safe efficient and
                                                competitive production of climatefriendly electricity in tvos vision nuclear

  927 in addition to the cost price electricity produced at olkiluoto shareholder value is increased by the completion and
  operational stabilization of ol3 profitability and costefficiency and customerorientation
  the electricity received by shareholders also falls into the category of customer value that benefits tvos shareholders 
  finnish industries and utilities with 133 municipalities behind them olkiluoto provides finland with steady base load power
  the fact that tvo produces approximately 17 of all electricity consumed in finland and thus significantly increases well
  being in the society can be considered a proof of tvos social value tvo and its contractors also create jobs and income
  for people in finland in addition to responsible electricity production the value chain emphasizes the high domestic content
  of the production operations as well as the careful selection of contractors and partners

  management of the nuclear fuel life cycle

  procurement of uranium only from responsible partners
  uranium is an element widely present in nature  it is approximately 40 times more common
  than silver about half of all uranium is produced by insitu leaching while 42 is produced
  in traditional underground or open pit mines the rest approximately 7 is obtained as a
  byproduct of other mining operations in 2014 primary production covered approximately
  85 of the uranium requirement of the worlds nuclear power plants the remaining 15
  was obtained from various inventories and the reprocessing of spent fuel
  the largest producers of uranium based on the statistics of 2014 are kazakhstan
  canada australia niger and namibia together these countries are responsible for
  approximately 80 of the worlds total production volume uranium is usually produced by
  large international companies with operations in several countries the nine largest
  companies cover approximately 85 of all production with nine mines producing roughly
  half of all uranium
  environmental protection and monitoring of mining operations as well as occupational and radiation safety requirements are
  defined on the basis of the legislation and regulations valid in the country where the operations take place the requirements
  set for the operations are further specified by licenses concerning the construction operation and environmental practices
  of the facilities proper practices require that the original licensing process of a production facility also pays attention to
  decommissioning operations funds for waste management the closure of the mine and the ore enrichment plant and
  landscaping should be gathered during production operations
  certification of quality environmental and occupational health and safety management systems is widely applied large
  operators in particular have certified the management systems of their production facilities responsible companies follow
  the same standards and the principles of safety and social responsibility in all their locations which in turn promotes the
  development of legislation and procedures of new mining countries

  wellplanned fuel procurement

  tvo has highlevel expertise in all phases of the fuel procurement process furthermore the composition of the fuel and the
  manner in which it is used are designed by tvo itself this is not very common as most operators procure their fuel from a
  single supplier on a turnkey basis the policy chosen by tvo clearly strengthens the companys position as finlands leading
  supplier of nuclear power
  tvo procures its fuel through a decentralized supply chain entering into negotiations and making procurement contracts with
  each separate supplier in the various stages of the supply chain there are several suppliers for each stage of the chain
  and the procurement operations are regularly subjected to competitive bidding
  procurement operations are based on longterm contracts with leading suppliers if required tvo purchases additional
  batches and services from the market the developments of which are followed actively the majority of the uranium procured
  by tvo comes from kazakhstan canada and australia and the fuel elements ordered by the company are constructed and

  assembled in germany or sweden

  tvo subjects fuel suppliers to strict evaluation

  tvo employs a supplier evaluation method and only procures uranium and nuclear fuel refining services from suppliers who
  have passed the evaluation process a systematic evaluation process precedes the closure of each supply contract in
  addition to the requirements set for the products the process also considers the reliability and responsibility of the supplier
  tvos supplier evaluation also includes active monitoring and evaluations at fixed intervals remote monitoring from finland
  and excursions to production sites both provide tvo with an opportunity to examine suppliers practices and when
  necessary to demand that changes are made to them the purpose of supplier evaluation is to ensure that suppliers pay
  appropriate attention to environmental issues the wellbeing of personnel and quality management special issues
  concerning mines are also considered such as the impact of operations on local people

  management of the nuclear fuel life cycle

  nuclear waste management
  low and intermediate level waste also called operating waste accumulates during the
  operation and maintenance of the nuclear power plant some of the nuclear power plant
  structures become radioactive during the operation of the plant and need to be disposed of
  when the plant has been decommissioned nuclear power plants use uranium fuel which
  during operation becomes high level radioactive waste that requires final disposal at a
  repository before final disposal spent nuclear fuel is kept in the interim storage facility for
  spent nuclear fuel
  responsibility for nuclear waste management lies with the nuclear power companies that
  must carry out the necessary nuclear waste management measures for their own waste at
  their own cost according to the finnish nuclear energy act nuclear waste generated in
  finland must be treated stored and finally disposed of in finland and the import of nuclear
  waste into finland is prohibited
  tvo also takes care of the operating waste and the power plant decommissioning waste it is disposed of in the operating

  waste repository located at olkiluoto the decommissioning waste generated during the dismantling of the plant units will also
  be deposited in facilities to be built in the same underground repository the repository also accommodates small radioactive
  waste generated in finnish healthcare industries and research institutions
  tvo also carefully manages the intermediate storage of spent nuclear fuel

  management of the nuclear fuel life cycle

  final disposal of spent nuclear fuel
  spent nuclear fuel must be managed to avoid any risk to people or organic nature a
  responsible producer of nuclear powergenerated electricity will look after the fuel all the
  way from bedrock to bedrock tvo and fortum have established a company posiva oy
  to handle the final disposal of the spent nuclear fuel generated in the olkiluoto and loviisa
  nuclear power plants
  final disposal has been researched and tested for more than 40 years first by the tvo
  nuclear waste office and later by posiva multidisciplinary research and development
  cooperation has yielded a solution that has gained wide acceptance in finland the eu and
  throughout the nuclear power community in fall 2015 posiva reached the age of 20 years
  in the solution developed by posiva spent nuclear fuel will be packed in copper canisters
  and placed in the olkiluoto bedrock at an approximate depth of 400 meters
  the safety of the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel is based on the multiple barriers
  principle the barriers ensure that nuclear waste does not come into contact with people or organic nature one deficient
  barrier a predictable geological change or other similar factor will not compromise effective isolation barriers include the
  solid state of the fuel the final disposal canister the bentonite clay buffer the tunnel filling material and the surrounding
  bedrock
  the plan is to pack the spent fuel into canisters at the encapsulation plant after encapsulation the canisters are transported
  to the underground disposal facility by an elevator
  before final disposal the spent fuel from olkiluoto plant units is kept in an interim storage facility within the power plant area
  from the power plant the fuel will be transported to the encapsulation plant of the final disposal facility in special containers
  spent fuel from tvos and fortums power plants in olkiluoto and loviisa will be placed in the olkiluoto repository
  plenty of time has been reserved for the preparation and practical execution of final disposal thorough preparations and
  careful implementation ensure the safety of the final disposal the disposal of spent fuel is scheduled to begin in the first half
  of the 2020s it will continue for nearly 100 years
  posiva submitted a final disposal facility construction license application to the ministry of employment and the economy in
  late 2012 stuk submitted its statement on the longterm safety of final disposal to the ministry of employment and the
  economy in february 2015 in the statement stuk took the position that posivas spent nuclear fuel encapsulation plant and
  final disposal facility can be constructed to be safe the finnish government granted posiva a construction license for the
  encapsulation plant and disposal facility in november 2015 2015 saw the completion of the second phase of the
  development of the onkalo site and the hoist building
  during the year under review successful testing of device prototypes ordered by posiva took place in the onkalo
  research facility a tunnel closure testing program coordinated by posiva and partially financed by the eu took a step
  forward with the conclusion of construction engineering next the project will go into the testing phase
  the 2015 nuclear waste management program that describes posivas development and implementation measures for the
  following three years 20162018 and also includes a preliminary description for the three years following these was
  completed and submitted to the ministry of employment and the economy in the fall
  in november of the year under review posiva restructured its organization with the aim of developing its operations and to
  move the final disposal project forward in an even more systematic manner
