9 aeon sustainability report 2013

    from stakeholder
    from a family that participated in the first aeon hometown forests program
    at the jusco shin hisai currently aeon hisai store in 1992

    three members of our family took part at the time my son was two years old but i decided to participate because i thought it would be a
    good memory for him he now says he has no memory of it but he feels an affinity for the trees we planted that have grown through the
    years as he has
        i think it is significant that these trees that were planted around 20 years ago have grown so well and provide natural richness to the
    environment this experience gave us the opportunity to deepen our appreciation of the environment and to give something to future
    generations i hope aeon will continue tree planting activities

   aging and urban populations
   providing a comfortable
   and convenient shopping
   environment for all consumers
   amidst sharp increases
   helping solve the social issues associated
   with aging and urbanization
   today japans population has reached the status of super aged society because more than 23 of its population is now
   over the age of 65 by the year 2020 this percentage is expected to climb as high as 29 more and more elderly have seen
   their range of daily activities diminish gradually and are finding it difficult to go shopping for their day to day needs at the
   same time although the number of commercial facilities has increased in urban areas there are actually fewer retail stores
   selling daily essentials which is led to a new population of people that are unable to go shopping which includes the
   elderly
        given this aeon is more committed than ever to providing all of its customers with an enjoyable convenient and
   pleasant shopping experience we will accomplish this through a senior shift to meet the needs of senior citizens from the
   four perspectives of products sales floor retail tenant development and services a digital shift to ensure consumers are
   able to shop easily and conveniently on our ecommerce site and an urban shift to bolster new store openings of more
   compact supermarkets for urban areas
        the graying of society is also progressing rapidly in china and the asean region as a result aeon will push forward with
   an asia shift that builds upon its experience in the japan market this will enable it to provide a convenient and pleasant
   shopping environment for all of its customers in china and asean which face similar issues our ultimate goal is to fulfill our
   mission as a retailer to provide a lifeline for peoples lives around the world

    fiscal 2012 activities management approach
   aeon devised key performance indicators kpi as part of its commitment to achieving sustainable management in conjunction with this
   we have assigned divisions and person in charge for each kpi field and established a system for taking stock of and managing the results
   of activities on a regular basis since fiscal 2012 we have been reporting on the state of kpi implementation and sharing that information
   with all stakeholders
       in fiscal 2012 we established a new environmental target called the aeon eco project see page 27 because the co2 reduction level
   target set in the aeon manifesto on the prevention of global warming was achieved one year in advance of projections in fiscal 2011 as a
   result we devised new kpi and began managing our progress toward achieving the targets set out for fiscal 2020
       also given that circumstances related to kpi both within aeon and externally are subject to change we will be reviewing and
   reconsidering guidelines on a regular basis

   carbon offsetting refers to the process of purchasing credits
   generated by co2 reduction activities at a separate location to
   offset part or the entire amount of greenhouse gas emissions
   that for some reason cannot be completely reduced to zero
       in fiscal 2012 aeon group companies implemented the
   following carbon offsetting programs
       in fiscal 2013 these companies plan on continuing their
   carbon offsetting programs

hazardous substances sometimes however this wastewater may
contain large amounts of oils which can exceed legal limits or
clog up wastewater pipes leading to a leakage or other accident
as a result aeon conducts training for its employees and the
employees of its tenants to ensure day to day maintenance is
correctly performed including compliance with cleaning rules
for grease traps we have also included grease trap monitoring as
part of the required hygiene checks for our stores and adopted a
system where thirdparties regularly perform these checks
    furthermore aeon retail and several other aeon group
companies perform water quality testing concurrently that
includes sewerage as part of annual voluntary inspections
stores where problems are identified are required to make
improvements which helps to improve our overall wastewater
management practices we have set voluntary standards that are
set 5 below legal requirements and take immediate action if
any values exceed these standards during voluntary inspections

       after reading the aeon environmental and social report i                     at the same time aeon can encourage a shift to more
   discovered once again that the aeon group which stands as the                sustainable raw materials and ingredients by developing its
   largest retail group in japan and asia has responded to the many             procurement policy aeon already has carried products that use
   expectations that society places in companies in a very wide                 raw materials or ingredients certified by internationally recognized
   reaching yet in a meticulous manner in the top message section             organizations such as fsc and msc i would like aeon to increase
   president okada speaks of the need to give attention to a variety            the number of topvalu products made from such sustainable
   of issues endangering a healthy and sustainable society in order to          materials the ultimate goal should be for all of its raw materials and
   achieve the dual objectives of aeon group growth and societal              ingredients to be sustainably produced this is because making all
   development and i feel that these words have permeated the                  raw materials and ingredients sustainable will be required for truly
   companys daily business activities of course aeon is still unable to       sustainable products and consumption
   fully and completely cover and address all of the issues it faces but            of course such an undertaking cannot be done by aeon alone
   when you consider the size of the aeon group and the sheer volume             aeon must exhibit leadership over product manufacturers and
   of products it carries on a daily basis it is quite extraordinary that the   producers both in japan and abroad and lead the market this
   company is attempting to address such a wide range of issues in this         will be no easy task but not impossible for aeon who has already
   regard i highly commend the aeon groups level of commitment                shown its strong sense of responsibility for its lineup of private brand
       achieving true sustainability requires that the companys                 products
   initiatives be broadened in scope and number specifically aeon is               i would also like aeon to focus on educating customers as well
   in the process of shifting its business focus to asia where the entire        to ensure that they understand and support the value of products
   market is seeing robust growth and so it will have to answer the             that use sustainable ingredients and raw materials if aeon can
   question of how to secure the products and the raw materials and             increase the number of customers in japan and asia that select
   the ingredients needed for those products as demonstrated by                 products for peace of mind and not simply price alone then i
   the recent stories of the river eel unagi fishery resources are fast       believe we will be able to take another step toward achieving a truly
   approaching their quantitative limitations many of aeons products           sustainable society
   are made possible by natures bounty and this is why it will be
   critical for aeon and the sustainability of its business to find ways to      profile
