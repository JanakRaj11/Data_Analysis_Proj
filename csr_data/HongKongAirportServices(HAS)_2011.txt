     business performance

     in 2010 the tftlcd market experienced a slump in demand to counter the economic
     impact on the industry hannstar focused on strengthening our product structure and
     establishing a technology platform through vertical integration the largepanel
     capacity of our 53 generation plant was also refitted to produce small and midsized
     panels instead to reduce the risk from fluctuations in large panel pricing

     efforts on strengthening our product structure continued to focus on the netbook and
     mobile phone panel markets to exploit the yield advantage of by small and midsized
     panels at the 53 generation plant we also gradually expanded the share of small and
     midsized applications including smart phones gps netbook and onboard displays

     for vertical integration we not only continued to collaborate with hannstouch on touch
     panel development but also installed equipment at the southern taiwan plant to
     increase the monthly output of color filters by 50000 units touch control module
     production lines were also added at our nanjing plant in china as part of our move to
     establish an integrated supply chain for touch control

     to improve our business management we adopted an orderbased production model
     to manage our raw material semiproduct and final product inventories we also
     improved our cash flow management by strengthening collections and debt repayment
     in order to maintain a sound financial structure

     the goal in 2011 will be to maintain a monthly capacity utilization of over 90 with a
     focus on small and midsized panel products conventional tn technology will also
     be gradually transitioned over to advanced hsips wide view technology to meet the
     requirements of highend touch control smart phones and tablet pc products

     environmental sustainability




     response to climate change
     hannstar carries out the following activities as part of our environmental responsibility to
     cope with global warming and climate change

      gpmqc0800 certification of products
      developing a fullrange of ledbased products
      implementation of energysaving carbon reduction and halogenfree product design
      establishing a rohscompliant and halogenfree green supply chain
      strengthening ghg emission reduction and waste recycling efforts
      products are now progressively receiving green certification from global standards such
        as tco gs and energy star this will in turn help boost product quality strengthening
        our brand image and values

     hannstar has a quality center responsible for promoting our green quality policy a
     separate environmental protection department implements environmental management
     policies and the ghg emission reduction plan every center also carries out green
     management green supply chain and the development of green energysaving products

     hannstar is continuing to use total energysaving proposals to reduce our ghg
     emissions in 2010 we successfully reduced the ghg emissions to 008 tonnes per
     square meter of glass a reduction of 55 on the 018 tonnes per sq m from 2005

     perfluorinated compounds pfcs produced during etching and chemical gas
     deposition processes have a very high global warming potential gwp hannstar has
     installed combustiontype pfc burners to reduce the amount of sf6 nf3 and other
     pfcs that we release the equipment reduced in ghg emission reductions equivalent to
     980000 tonnes of co2 between 2005 and 2010

             for carbon and water footprint verification we received the first carbon footprint
             verification in the world for 101 tablet touch panels in december 2010 carbon
             footprint labeling was introduced in may 2011 and we will also complete the water
             footprint verification process for the 101 tablet touch panel at the end of october

             in the future we will continue to conduct carbon emission inventory to accurately
             track the carbon emissions produced during production internalexternal logistics and
             employees business travel awareness and communication initiatives will be used to
             extend our companys influence and gradually help our suppliers establish their own
             disclosure framework for their products carbon emissions and ghg inventories
             together we will make our own contribution to reducing ghg emissions

             there has been no regulatory action or protests due to environmental pollution in recent

     green hanns actions
     action 1           go       promote energysaving in the plants


     energysaving measures at the lcd plant
     to promote a green corporate culture and realize the targets on energysaving and
     carbon reduction it is essential for the stsp plant to rationalize energy consumption
     during production adjustments were therefore made to machines energy
     consumption clean room temperaturehumidity fan filter unit ffu operation and
     ambient lighting to reduce electricity consumption without affecting product quality

     the following improvements were made in 2010



      1      in 2010 the lcd plant began adopting the concept of hibernation mode for
             production machinery when a machine is not in use it automatically enters
             hibernation mode the mode greatly reduces electricity consumption when
             not in operation


      2
             for plant administration the consumption of utilities was optimized by making
             adjustments to the chilledwatercompressed dry air cda systems

             several energysaving initiatives were implemented in the offices there
      3      are fewer workers on weekends so the office airconditioning is set to 27c
             instead of 25c the amount of office lighting was rationalized and switches
             installed as well so people can turn off the lighting in their area when they
             leave all office lighting was upgraded to led lighting in 2010 as well to
             reduce electricity consumption




     over 30 energysaving initiatives were carried out in the
     lcd plant during 2010 electricity consumption per sq m
     at the stsp plant has decreased by 20 from 104kwh
     in 2007 to 84kwh in 2010 our target of reducing
     electricity consumption by 20 in 2011 was therefore
     realized a year early in the future we hope to continue
     carrying out further measures to reduce energy
     consumption and carbon emissions

     green product development planning

     hannstar spares no effort when it comes to the development and promotion of green
     products the design of green products and use of green materials are given the
     highest priority by rd units we have now expanded our product carbon footprint
     audit to support the global green trend and meet customers requirement for green
     products by the end of 2011 we will have at least 4 carbon footprint and 1 water
     footprint product certifications so we can provide more green products to our

     the stsp plant has been reviewing the use of chemical agents since 2007 reductions
     and recycling improvements have been progressively carried out to the targets as well as
     chemical agents used during the arraycolor and filtercell processes including stripper
     acid reduction pr recovery and reduction thinner reduction as well as etchant and
     developer reduction in 2010 improvements focused mainly on consumption
     rationalization maintenance rationalization introduction of the a1 process and
     improvements to the pr recovery process the results were as follow


     1 target consumption was reduced by 20 in 2010 compared to 2009
     2 pr consumption was reduced by 14 compared to 2009 while the recovery rate
       was also increased to 47 2010 average up from 44
     3 thinnerdeveloper reduction and recovery reduced by 26 and 18 compared to
       2009 as well 2010 coincided with product transition at the plant so there was an
       increase in the consumption of lab chemicals compared to 2009 because process
       improvements have not yet fully in effect nevertheless chemical consumption
       dropped to 0021 tonnessq m compared to 0025 tonnessq m in 2008 an

packaging improvements at the lcd plant

packaging materials have traditionally being designed to absorb shock and impacts in
order to prevent damage to lcd products during shipment due to the greater size and
weight of full and quarter sheet shipments they were usually packaged in pp cartons
the smaller number of pieces 20 and large size meant packaging materials were
consumed at a high rate as a result the stsp plant began using vacuum packaging in
cartons 30 pcs per carton to produce further savings 40pcs cartons were introduced
in 2010 reducing the consumption of packaging materials by 33

a logistics hub to collect all returns for monthly shipment instead of shipping each return
separately the reduction in the number of vehicle movementstrips reduces the
damage to the environment and shipping costs as well

european energy labeling directive 1062010

the european energy labelling directive 1062010 requires all tvs imported into
europe to display an energy efficiency label from december 2011 onwards the energy
efficiency label is familiar to european consumers as it is already required for home
appliances such as refrigerators each label shows a 7grade energy rating from a
to g a red grating means poor energy efficiency while a green a rating means
very good energy efficiency in addition to the energy rating the new label must also
indicate the diagonal length of the screen power consumption average annual power
consumption 4 hours of use a day standby power consumption and regulatory code
hannstar has been working on optimizing the energy efficiency of all tvs produced for
europe since the start of 2011

                                       energy efficient products

advances in technology means portable lcd products are no in great demand tablet
products are particularly popular today to take advantage of this trend hannstar pays
particular emphasis to the energy efficiency of new product designs as lcds do not
emit light and are reliant on the led backlights for illumination leds have become a
major source of power consumption in lcd panels

to overcome this challenge hannstar partnered with unity opto technology to develop
a 10 tablet product that uses highefficiency lowvoltage leds the new product
not only meets market requirements but also improves display brightness making it a
green energyefficiency and costeffective product we will continue to develop even
more energy efficient and lcd products that meet public demand


    a comparison of normal and highefficiency leds is provided below
    p power consumption  i current  v voltage
    normal 20ma33v  66mw
    high efficiency 20ma28v  56mw the above is the difference between single leds

    if a 10 product uses 36 leds then the power savings are as follow
    66m56m36036w the power savings for the backlight are then 0362376151
    reducing power consumption by 15 means the tablet pcs endurance is extended by
    1 hour

     product carbon footprint verification
     in recent years the influence of global warming iso 14064 ghg audit and bsi pas
     2050 product carbon footprint audit has seen carbon disclosure become an
     important environmental issue among international enterprises

     green products  services are constructed from green design green purchasing green
     manufacturing and recycling hannstar has embraced the ideals of green products and
     is determined to join the ranks of suppliers that have made a contribution or difference
     in this field as part of our social responsibility

     hannstar is committed to the development and manufacture of green products in
     december 2010 we became the first company to receive carbon footprint verification
     for a 101 tablet touch panel and carbon footprint labeling will be introduced in may
     2011 starting in 2011 q2 we will complete the carbon footprint audit for one product a
     month and complete the carbon footprint audits for 4 products by the end of 2011 the
     audits will enable to accurately track the carbon emissions generated during production
     internalexternal logistics and employees business travel

     awareness and communication initiatives will be used to extend our companys
     influence and gradually help our suppliers establish their own disclosure framework
     for their products carbon emissions and ghg audits together we will make our own
     contribution to reducing ghg emissions


     2010 december carbon footprint verification
      1 suppliers must pass the hsd qsaqpagp system audit
      2 appropriate reports or certification must be provided before new materials

action 6              go        water resource management
product water footprint verification

unequal distribution of water resources caused by climate change may lead to water
shortages in the future water resource management is therefore becoming
increasingly important and water footprint is now a very real risk for the global industry
being a subtropical island taiwans annual rainfall is 34 times the world average
rainfall the amount of usable water is just 16 of the world average so water
consumption is an important issue for businesses in taiwan and around the world

hannstar plans to begin actively auditing our water footprint in 2011 by convening a
supplier conference to explain our planning and supplier requirements we expect
thirdparty verification on the water footprint of our 101 tablet touch panel product
in october 2011 we hope that the product carbonwater footprint audits will provide
us with accurate data for future waterenergy saving and carbon reduction efforts
hannstar will then be better equipped to fulfill our commitment to green production
and do our best for the environment

there has been no regulatory action or protests due to environmental pollution as of the
end of 2010

     stsp plant stsp student river patrol

     patrol area waterways around the southern taiwan sciencebased industrial park
     participants the student river patrol camp is hosted every season to promote
     environmental awareness

     river pollution is not only caused by a lack of sewage infrastructure but more
     important the apathy of the general public and selfish businesses we believe that this
     environmental vandalism can only be fought through basic environmental education
     participation in waterway conservation and promoting environmental education for the
     waterways

     to this end we started out with senior students from local elementary schools near the
     science park the first year consisted of four sixgrade classes from the affiliated
     elementary school of the nanke experimental junior high school 200912  201011
     a childrens river patrol camp is organized every season to promote environmental
     awareness and carry out basic environmental education the camp proved very popular
     with the schools so an additional camp was held by the end of 2010 a total of 5
     camps have been held with over 250 students taking part
