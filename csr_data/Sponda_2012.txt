chief executives review
in this video kari inkinen presents spondas year 2011


the purchase of fennia block strenghened our property portfolio in the helsinki cbd kari inkinen president and ceo



please read the full review below


year 2011 was very successful for sponda we increased our revenue and our net operating income was the highest in the companys 20 year
history despite the challenging market conditions in 2011 the occupancy rates of our properties improved


implementation of the strategy

our strategy is to aim for profitable growth in the property market in finland and russia in 2011 we completed many newbuild and renovation
projects that support our strategy the sites were located in helsinki the oulu region vantaa and tampere the completion of the projects
increased the proportion of office and shopping centre properties in our property portfolio in line with our investment strategy our portfolio which
consists mainly of offices and shopping centres located in central areas was strengthened significantly by the acquisition of the fennia block in
the spring


financing

the tightening of economic conditions in 2011 was reflected in the financial market as decreased availability of financing we can continue
expect this to pose challenges to many companies in 2012 due to the uncertainty in the market we decided to refinance most of our loans
expiring in 2012 the successful execution of significant financial arrangements in challenging conditions can be considered proof of the
financing markets trust in our company sponda will have no significant refinancing needs before 2014


business environment

the favourable market development of 2010 continued throughout the first half of 2011 after which economic uncertainty once again began to
increase the change in the economy was reflected in the rental market in the latter half of the year early in the year rental levels in the prime
areas had risen and vacancy rates had fallen but these levelled off in the latter half in the outskirts of cities rental levels remained unchanged
and very high vacancy rates were seen in some areas


an increased offering of premises and unchanged demand will probably increase vacancy rates in the helsinki metropolitan area in 2012 with
200000 square metres of new office premises to be built in the region during the year in economically uncertain times tenants and investors
traditionally focus their interest on properties in prime areas which leads to increasing differences in the appreciation and vacancy rate of
properties located in different areas


our second important market area russia has developed more favourably than the finnish market especially in moscow rents have risen and
vacancy rates fallen in st petersburg the development has been less pronounced russia has been a good investment choice for our business
and we believe that the favourable development of the market will continue


environmental responsibility

environmental responsibility has a significant role in spondas operations because properties are the major source of greenhouse gas emissions
in finland therefore companies in the real estate sector play an important role in improving the efficiency of energy use and consequently
arresting climate change

                                                                                                                   annual report 2011       year 2011




sponda has chosen environmental responsibility as its strategic focus and the development of environmental responsibility processes is part of
the implementation of this strategic goal the work particularly aims at reducing energy consumption in the properties we strive for energy
efficiency in our property development projects and in property maintenance in addition to the improvement of our own activities we encourage
our customers to pay attention to energy consumption in properties with the help of our energy efficiency and environmental partnership
programmes


in order to ensure that our properties are energy efficient and environmentally friendly we apply for environmental certificates for all newbuild
sites and the most important renovation sites in 2011 four of our properties received the leed or breeam environmental certificate


urban development

as a responsible company in the property sector we see urban development as an important part of our social responsibility we take part in
urban development by taking into account the environment of properties the urban structure and the cityscape in our property development
projects we own many protected properties by investing in their renovation and maintenance we are also investing in the cityscape and the
appeal of the area surrounding the property


the ongoing citycenter project in the centre of helsinki is an excellent example of our desire to participate in the development of urban centres
when completed the project will considerably improve the appeal of the area the service tunnel built as part of the project enables underground
freight deliveries to the quarter away from the bustling streets of the city centre


future outlook

we believe that our highquality property portfolio with the focus on prime areas will continue to be our strength in 2012 we will particularly focus
on developing our property portfolio maintaining occupancy rates and rents at a healthy level and looking after our equity ratio


in order to achieve the goals we have set and to respond to market challenges we must also improve our own operations sponda is currently
concentrating on customer management the enhancement of our customer service models and the development of quality and environmental
responsibility processes the work started already in 2010 and will continue in 2012


i would like to thank our shareholders for their trust in our company and our customers for their loyalty and partnership in the development of our
environmental services and other projects i would also like to thank our personnel for their active participation in the development of our
processes and services in 2011

business environment
after a positive start to the year the markets suffered from uncertainty resulting from the public debt crisis in europe and the united
states on the property markets the uncertain economic conditions led to caution in property transactions and tenant decisions
regarding the need for new business premises however this cautious approach is not yet reflected in key figures other than
transaction volume of 2011



markets characterised by uncertainty

positive economic growth in the early part of 2011 fizzled after the summer as uncertainty began to dominate the markets the main source of
uncertainty was the public debt crisis in europe and the united states according to estimations finlands gdp growth in 2011 was 26 per cent
one reason for the slowdown in gdp growth was the finnish export sector which is sensitive to cyclical fluctuations in the international economy
and began to slow down in the first half of the year consumer confidence in the economy was also on the decline


the public debt crisis which began to deteriorate rapidly in late summer 2011 and the weaker general economic prospects make it difficult to
formulate reliable forecasts the finnish economys growth prospects weakened considerably in autumn 2011 gdp growth is expected to
decline to 04 per cent in 2012 and recover to 17 per cent in 2013 there has also been a marked increase in uncertainty in finlands key export
markets


property investment is a latecycle business which meant that the market for business premises continued to be positive in the late summer
despite increasing uncertainty about the economy this was particularly reflected in the increased net takeup of office properties growth in new
construction and a slight decrease in vacancy rates


investors are more risk averse in uncertain times which leads to a growing gap between low and high risk profile property investments central
helsinkis position as the most attractive property market is expected to solidify as uncertainty increases

property transactions

the brisk growth in property transactions pointed to by springtime forecasts eventually failed to materialise total property transaction volume in
2011 was low at approximately eur 17 billion


the meagre supply of prime properties contributed to the low transaction volume the challenging conditions on the financial markets drive
investors to focus on lowrisk properties with reliable rental cash flows and better financing terms at the same time current owners are largely
unwilling to sell prime properties the most demanded properties on the market are highly rated office and retail properties in central helsinki and
modern office properties with excellent transport links in the helsinki metropolitan area


according to the raklikti business premises barometer the yield requirement for prime office properties in helsinki cbd at the end of 2011
stood at 575 per cent yield requirements are expected to increase slightly in 2012 the yield requirements for prime properties outside helsinki
also decreased somewhat in 2011 the yield requirement for prime office premises in helsinkis central business district declined throughout the
year but levelled off late in 2011 due to the prevailing general uncertainty however the yield requirement for prime retail space continued to fall
below that of office premises the yield requirement for prime retail space in helsinkis central business district now stands at 525 per cent


according to spondas estimates the values of office properties in the helsinki metropolitan area increased moderately in the first half of 2011
only to slow down later in the year due to the uncertain economic situation


in 2011 international investors accounted for over one quarter of the total property transaction volume in finland their share remaining largely
unchanged from 2010 the relatively small proportion of the transaction volume attributable to international investors is primarily the result of the
poor availability of debt financing the meagre supply of prime properties and the tendency of investors to focus on familiar home markets during
difficult periods

the finnish market
the finnish market for office premises

vacancy rates for offices in helsinki metropolitan area decreased during the year 2011 despite increased uncertainty on the markets the
vacancy rate for offices in the helsinki metropolitan area stood at 106 per cent and in helsinki business district at 56 per cent at the end of
2011 the vacancy rate is expected to rise slightly in 2012 this estimate is based on weaker economic prospects and the fact that nearly
200000 square metres of new office space is currently being built in the helsinki metropolitan area regional differences are also expected to
increase and a larger number of properties are likely to be left permanently off the market


the next few years will see a significant amount of internal movement in helsinkis central business district as a new office hub develops in
töölönlahti freeing up considerable space elsewhere in central helsinki as companies relocate however the effects of this wave of relocations
will not yet be seen in 2012

strategic operations in 2012
2012 is shaping up to be a year of challenges

sponda aims to adapt quickly to economic conditions the year 2011 was a positive one for the company but the market prospects for 2012 are
quite uncertain the demand for business premises has stabiliced and the year 2012 is expected to be challenging for spondas operations due
to new premises to be constructed on the market the uncertain economic conditions call for a critical analysis of growth prospects particularly
when it comes to property development projects


competitive advantage through property holdings in strategic locations

spondas property portfolio is built on highquality business premises in key locations which gives the company a relative competitive advantage
even during an economic slowdown under challenging economic conditions the occupancy rates and rental levels of properties in prime
locations develop more positively than those located in more peripheral areas in total 65 per cent of spondas property portfolio is located in
helsinkis highly valued central business and ruoholahti districts the company is confident that the high proportion of prime properties in its
property portfolio will be a profitable strategy even under uncertain market conditions



a strong balance sheet provides operational stability

sponda has a strong balance sheet which provides a stable foundation for the companys operations and gives it added flexibility in uncertain
markets nevertheless the company has cut back on planned investments for the next few years in order to ensure that it can maintain a good
financial standing the company currently has only eur 41 million in existing commitments to property development investments for the next two
years during times of economic uncertainty the company aims to finance its growth primarily by selling off properties that are not fully in line with
its strategy

russia
spondas russia business unit leases manages and develops business premises in russia the company has been operating in
russia since 2006 spondas longterm goal is to have 1020 per cent of its balance sheet invested in russia in properties located in
moscow and st petersburg


sponda has established its position in the russian market with its quality property portfolio customerfocused working methods and strong
regional knowhow the company owns a total of nine properties in russia four office properties two shopping centres a logistics property and
two land areas both the business properties and the land areas are located in moscow and st petersburg regions



positive trend in occupancy rates continued

the longterm objective of the russia business unit is to achieve growth and profitability in the russian market in 2011 the focus was
particularly on improving profitability by developing operational efficiency and ensuring the stability of cash flow while the company concluded no
actual sales or purchase transactions during the year it continued to seek growth opportunities by actively surveying the market to identify
potential properties for purchase


there were no changes in the number of russian properties their locations or floor areas in 2011 the units total revenue in 2011 was
eur 251 million with 286 clients and 345 leasing agreements the total revenue increased over 6 per cent compared to the previous year


spondas economic occupancy rate in russia continued to outpace the market in 2011 reaching 987 at the end of the year the high occupancy
rate of spondas properties proves that the company is successful in offering its corporate clients business premises solutions that suit their
business operations and needs


the fair values of spondas russian properties increased slightly in 2011 the fair value of the property portfolio stood at eur 2246 million at
the end of the year 2010 2042 the increase in value was primarily due to a decrease in the yield requirement for the moscow region during
the first half of the year the fair values of properties in st petersburg remained largely unchanged from 2010



systematic renovation of properties

on the russian property development front there was progress in the longterm project to develop the europa terminal logistics centre in
moscow province the building permit was granted in early 2011 construction work will begin in phases depending on demand


the systematic condition surveys of russian properties that began in 2010 were concluded for properties in moscow in 2011 one property in st
petersburg has not been surveyed yet and the renovation work for its part is scheduled for 2012 the condition survey involves inspecting all
properties and preparing an improvement plan for each of them in 2011 a total of eur 03 million was invested in improving the quality and
condition of the companys properties in russia there are no major renovation needs for any of the russian properties



implementing environmental responsibility is challenging in russia

spondas role as a socially responsible partner is highlighted in russia sponda encourages a sense of community by among other things
organising events for tenants and their families sponda also cooperates with local autorities to enliven the cities by organising common events
in its shopping centres


maintaining a high standard of environmental responsibility is challenging in russia due to the lack of recycling infrastructure and the absence of
a culture that encourages to energy conservation despite the challenges of the operating environment sponda promotes environmental
responsibility in its properties in partnership with its clients by taking small steps towards more environmentally sound practices using motion
detectors for lighting control adopting energysaving light bulbs and regulating building temperatures are examples of practical measures
implemented by sponda in russia to improve energy efficiency

sponda is a member of the international green building council which promotes environmental awareness also in russia in the future the
company will also apply for environmental certification under international standards for all its newly developed properties as well as some of its
existing business premises in russia sponda is currently in the process of applying for environmental certification for one of its russian
properties


spondas energy efficiency scheme which was launched in 2009 was expanded in 2010 to cover the companys russian properties in 2011
the results of energy consumption reviews were analysed to set energy efficiency targets for each property and plan measures for achieving
them going forward the impacts and results of these measures will be monitored in regular client meetings



growth and profitability remain the key objectives for 2012

the negative developments in the general economic situation are also casting a shadow over the prospects of the russia business unit despite
the fact that the prospects in russia are significantly brighter than they are in finland the russian economy is continuing to grow albeit at a
more moderate rate than expected russias economic growth continues to be based on the export of oil and other raw materials the price of oil
and strong consumption russian trends in property values and rental levels are positive


the russia business units objectives for 2012 remain the same as before achieving growth and enhancing profitability through improving the
efficiency of operations the stability in the moscow market in particular highlights the need for further growth with this in mind the company is
working systematically to identify potential targets for purchase


the company also looked to improve the consistency of its business management by adapting an operating handbook originally based on the
companys finnish business structure to suit the russian market instead of simply translating the document it was adapted to the russian
operating environment and operations the operating handbook will be used in 2012 to promote consistent management practices and ways of
working

risks and risk management
sponda uses effective risk management to ensure the continuity of its operations and the achievement of key objectives risk
management is integrated into the companys planning system and daytoday operations



integrated risk management as a key strength

sponda manages the risks associated with its operations by identifying measuring and preventing key uncertainties the company employs
effective risk management to protect its business operations and ensure that key objectives are achieved risks are assessed in terms of their
probability as well as their financial impact achieving financial targets is a sign that risk management has been successful spondas key risks
are classified as strategic risks operational risks damage and asset risks and financing risks


sponda has adopted a systematic approach to risk management and one of the companys key strengths is its ability to integrate risk
management as part of the strategy process the enterprise resource planning system and business processes the responsibility for risk
management is determined in accordance with business responsibility the ultimate responsibility for risk management lies with the board of
directors which sets risk management objectives decides on risk management policy organises risk management and monitors key risks
business units and corporate functions are responsible for arranging for risk management to be monitored and reported as part of the companys
other reporting activities the companys internal audit function monitors the effectiveness of the risk management system


risk management is tied to the companys annual planning process and risks are assessed in a risk survey carried out twice a year the risk
survey identifies the companys key risks assesses the probability of their occurrence and potential impacts thereof and defines risk
management procedures the risk survey is updated every autumn in conjunction with budgeting the groups risk management guidelines and
the operations handbook are updated to reflect the decisions made on the basis of the risk survey the risk survey also includes an assessment
of the companys approach to risks


spondas risk management toolbox includes risk aversion risk elimination and reducing the probability that risks will materialise risks can also
be restricted and reduced a business continuity and recovery plan has been prepared for the contingency that substantial risks materialise



no major changes in shortterm risks

spondas risk management was effective in 2011 and no substantial risks materialised in the risk survey carried out by the company the
availability of financing resulting from a weaker business environment was identified as a new shortterm risk sponda protects itself against this
risk by actively monitoring the status of the financial markets and by taking a proactive approach to restructuring its liabilities due to effective risk
management and refinancing arrangements difficulties in the availability of financing are unlikely to pose an immediate risk to sponda in the next
two years the companys next major refinancing needs will arise in 2014


with the exception of the weaker availability of financing key shortterm risks remained unchanged a decline in the economic occupancy rate
resulting from a slowdown in economic growth and a loss of rental income due to tenant insolvency remain relevant risks in spondas operations
with regard to spondas russian business operations the exchange rate risk and differences in legislation and official practices between russia
and finland are the major risks and uncertainty factors

to spondas operations                          risk management actions

decline in tenants solvency                    sponda carries out regular checks to monitor tenants solvency and changes therein most tenants submit a
                                                security deposit corresponding to 3 to 6 months rent at the start of their tenancy the company has a diverse
                                                tenant base representing a wide variety of sectors

availability of financing                       sponda reorganises maturing loans in a timely manner when the financial market is tightening up the
                                                company refinances loans well before their maturity spondas next major refinancing needs will arise in 2014

                                                sponda mitigates its interest rate risk through fixedinterest loans and interest rate derivative contracts
interest rate risk

special features of the russian property        sponda receives half of its russian rental revenue in us dollars and half in roubles most of the rent payments
market and exchange rate fluctuations           made in roubles are tied to the us dollar or euro exchange rate the exchange rate risk arising from the use of
                                                the rouble is reduced by the fact that a significant portion of the companys own expenses in russia is also
                                                paid in roubles sponda hedges a sixmonth cash flow from russia the companys investments in russia are
                                                mainly funded in euros from the parent company balance sheet




strategic risks
risks relating to the business environment

uncertainty in the business environment and an oversupply of new office premises are expected to result in the vacancy rates for business
premises in finland remaining at a high level the occupancy rate of spondas office premises is high but increasing supply and weaker
economic growth may have a negative effect on spondas rental operations the occupancy rate of retail premises has remained high despite
the weaker business environment but the prospects for logistics properties have become dimmer as finnish exports are beginning to decline


the weakening of the financial markets caused by the european public debt crisis resulted in poorer availability of financing in 2011 sponda has
taken steps to prepare for the risks related to the availability of financing by refinancing its loans maturing in 2012 spondas next major
refinancing needs will arise in 2014



changes in the fair value of properties

the value of real estate is sensitive to cyclical fluctuations it is affected by several factors including interest rates inflation economic growth
business environment availability of credit property taxation demographic factors and construction activity changes in supply and demand can
also significantly affect property values regardless of the general economic trends of regional real estate markets



loss of rental income

in 2011 spondas ten largest clients accounted for approximately 31 2010 32 per cent of rental income the loss or insolvency of one or
several tenants may lead to a substantial loss in revenue for the company the sustained vacancy rate of a property may also have a negative
impact on the property value as well as the companys balance sheet and operating profit sponda was successful in managing the risks related
to its tenants solvency in 2011 as indicated by receivables from tenants remaining at the previous years levels


at the end of 2011 sponda had a total of 3277 3111 lease contracts and 2160 2003 customers the largest client sectors were retail
banking and the public sector



exchange rate risk from russian operations and differences in property markets

spondas russian properties are located in st petersburg and moscow at the end of 2011 russian properties represented 7 7 per cent of the
companys balance sheet total differences in legislation and official practices between russia and finland may cause risks for spondas
operations the exchange rate risk associated with russian business operations may also have a negative effect on the companys profit

sponda has set an upper limit for its russian property holdings of 1020 per cent of the balance sheet total which helps mitigate the risks
associated with the companys russian operations



risks relating to property development

spondas property development operations focus on development projects of unbuilt land areas and buildings requiring modernisation that are
profitable but require extensive planning and may go on for several years due to the longterm nature of the projects rental income and cash
flow can in some cases be delayed by several years sponda also incurs expenses from the planning phase that takes place before a project is
confirmed the key risks are related to the degree of success in leasing premises and the potential increase in construction costs the company
manages the risks relating to property development by requiring a minimum advance occupancy rate of 50 per cent before launching projects


due to the uncertainty in the business environment sponda has adopted a careful approach to launching new property development projects in
2011 the company had two significant ongoing property development projects in helsinki the citycenter project in the central business district
and an office building project in ruoholahti in 2011 sponda invested approximately eur 585 million in property development projects in 2011
sponda owned unbuilt land areas worth eur 903 million

citycenter case study
the city centre is like an icon for the entire city says tuomas rajajärvi head of the helsinki city planning department to illustrate the
significance of the city centre to helsinki as a whole if the city centre is lacking in vitality developing other areas will be very challenging



city planning promotes making better use of the inner courtyards of city blocks

the citys aim is to maintain the current scale of the helsinki city centre which poses challenges to the development of the central areas of the
city as a result current development plans are largely based on connecting the properties that make up city blocks by making better use of the
space between them by constructing arcades and glass roofs for example rajajärvi says the citycenter project with its inner courtyard covered
by a glass roof is a model example of this type of development


one of the main objectives of helsinkis city planning is ecoefficiency which is managed through building permits according to rajajärvi
creating business opportunities and services in locations with good public transport access is a great example of sustainable planning



the citycenter project supports the development of a pedestrian city centre

rajajärvi considers the renovation of the citycenter block to be an important development project that promotes helsinkis positive image as a
city he believes that the new look for the former sausage building will make the block and its surroundings much more attractive which will
represent a significant upgrade for the station tunnel area that was previously perceived by many as unpleasant the citycenter project will also

support the development of keskuskatu into a highquality pedestrian street



helsinkis image as an attractive and modern winter city

the renewal of the citycenter block also has a positive effect on helsinkis image as a winter city according to rajajärvi the citycenter blocks
new heated walkways covered with glass roofs and solutions such as the planned cover for the saarinen courtyard will make central helsinki
more pleasant for pedestrians in the wintertime he adds that street heating and lighting will also make the wintery city centre more attractive


rajajärvi says lighting has a great deal of potential in developing the image of the city improvements to lighting can make central helsinki more
pleasant and attractive without the need to make changes to major structures new led technology also means that lighting solutions can be
implemented in more environmentally friendly ways than before



cooperation as the foundation of development

rajajärvi says urban development is a shared process where multiple actors play important roles he hopes property companies in particular
show a genuine desire to develop helsinki in cooperation with the other parties involved the central business district has tailormade zoning
plans and properties must be compatible with their surroundings


from the citys perspective the key aspects of the citycenter renovation project are the cityscape and accessibility in practice accessibility
refers to aspects such as walkways that are sufficiently wide to allow large amounts of people to move smoothly in the citycenter block and the
areas surrounding the central railway station the accessibility of central helsinki has also been improved by the maintenance tunnel project
related to the citycenter project the tunnel allows maintenance vehicles to travel underground instead of taking up space on the city streets the
project was implemented by several parties involved in helsinkis development including sponda

in the urban environment design is always present in the architecture of buildings and city districts for sponda good design means
the aesthetics of the properties but also functionality and flexibility

meeting customer requirements while observing the cityscape

the planning of properties at sponda is always customerbased with a focus on the changing needs of customers this applies to both new
construction and renovation good overall solutions are emphasised in order to guarantee the economy healthiness and safety of premises
successful design of office premises also creates a positive image for the company and improves working conditions


in addition to the needs of customers good design can also respond to the development requirements of cities functional and flexible properties
designed with environmental aspects in mind attract companies and thereby improve the availability of services in cities the look of the city or
the city district is always taken into account in the design paying special attention to the local characteristics and the existing building stock


properties located in the centres of cities experience substantial wear as large volumes of people pass through them on a daily basis in
properties such as these design focuses on functionality and accessibility in addition to aesthetics special attention is paid to factors allowing
the premises to withstand wear and tear but also the test of time




taking environmental aspects into account in the
development of cities
spondas property portfolio is focused on urban areas near traffic and customer flows a central location also decreases the
environmental load of properties



ecological location

lots of services have gathered in the centres of cities and near public transport routes they stimulate the cities and make it easier to respond to
the needs of local residents by concentrating its properties in the centres of cities and near good public transport routes sponda offers the
companies operating in its premises the possibility to favour environmentally friendly solutions in commuting a good central location of
properties also brings the company closer to the services offered in the central districts thereby reducing the need to travel



flexible and ecological premises

in addition to location solutions and choices related to construction and renovation also have a significant impact on the environmental impact
and functionality of properties throughout their life cycle good planning aims to make all premises both newly constructed and renovated into
flexible buildings with a long life cycle


flexibility extends the life cycle of properties and reduces the environmental load caused by alterations repair and renovations even the use of
the building can be changed when required spondas flexible premises also offer a flexible framework for the development of cities economic
life


in addition to flexibility sponda pays particular attention to energy efficiency and environmentally sound solutions of its properties sponda
applies either leed or breeam certificates for its newly constructed buildings the company utilises the certification process to better meet
the environmental demands of its customers



lighting brings comfort in an energyefficient manner

utilising new environmentally friendly technologies allows an energyefficient improvement of comfort and safety in cities in the renovation of the
lighting of citycenter in 2011 for example environmentally friendly and energyefficient led technology was implemented in addition many of
the companys properties already utilise street heating making use of the waste heat from properties improving the usability of the city centre
during the winter the company intends to extend the use of street heating in the future

responsibility as part of spondas strategy
responsibility is an integral part of spondas daytoday operations and business expertise supporting the companys profitability
and longterm viability



responsibility and strategy

spondas main priorities are increasing shareholder value ensuring the sustainability of operations and continuously developing the company
the companys principle of responsibility plays an important role in the pursuit of these priorities sponda has highlighted the development of the
customer experience and environmental responsibility as strategic focal points in its business development



increasing environmental requirements

the property sector has a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency sponda supports the fight against climate
change in its own operations by improving the energy efficiency of its properties and reducing their environmental impact the united nations
environmental programme estimates that buildings make up as much as 40 per cent of global energy consumption with the majority of that
consumption occuring during use as efforts to reduce emissions are ramped up national and eu requirements on corporate environmental
responsibility will become tighter


sponda believes that in the future client companies will increasingly pay attention to the life cycle environmental impact of their business
premises sponda is preparing for these future challenges today by investing in improving its environmental expertise and developing solutions
that promote the wellbeing of the environment


environmental requirements are highlighted in spondas property development operations as well as property maintenance sponda also works
together with its clients to develop more energyefficient and environmentally sustainable business premises as the majority of the environmental
impact of a building is created during its use


the wellbeing of the environment is included among the criteria the company applies in deciding on property investments in accordance with its
investment strategy the focus of spondas property portfolio is on central locations with good public transport links



developing the customer experience

sponda aims to achieve a competitive advantage and identify the best ways of working from the customers perspective through its new
customer experience management process the company aims to be a trustworthy property partner that offers each customer premises that are
precisely tailored to their needs combined with an effective customer relationship in customer relations the goal is to achieve a longterm
interactive partnership rather than a unilateral landlordtenant relationship


sponda actively monitors changes in how client companies work and what new requirements they have regarding their business premises in
order to develop its own operations in accordance with the changing needs of its customer base



managing responsibility

environmental responsibility and managing the customer experience are strategic focal points for sponda and the company has set annual
targets and defined key actions for them the executive board and the board of directors regularly monitor the achievement of targets and
implementation of actions the major challenges in achieving the targets set for environmental responsibility are related to the reduction of

    environmental impacts during the use of buildings as in the companys properties work over 30000 individuals who each play an important role
    in making environmentally conscious choices on a daily basis


    sponda encourages its employees to work towards the goals related to environmental responsibility and the customer experience by including
    them as factors in the incentive scheme that covers all personnel




    responsibility priorities
    spondas vision which guides the implementation and development of its responsible operations is to be the most reliable profitable and
    responsible player in the real estate sector implementing sustainable development the strategic focus of the companys responsibility is on
    environmental responsibility and the customer experience


    in 2011 sponda defined seven responsibility priorities the implementation and development of which will be particularly focused on in the
    companys operations


    some members of spondas executive board were involved with defining responsibility priorities the priorities are based on the companys
    strategy and in particular on its strategic areas of focus related to customer experience and environmental responsibility the purpose of the
    responsibility priorities is to support developing spondas operations from the perspective of sustainable development


    spondas responsibility priorities are


     improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint
     material efficiency
     property locations
     enhancing the customer experience
     investing in employees
     transparency in operations
     taking the industry forward


    more detailed information on each of the responsibility priorities can be found in sections dedicated to them in this online annual report




    improving energy efficiency and reducing the
    carbon footprint
    the property sector plays a key role in mitigating climate change and improving energy efficiency sponda recognises this and pays
    particular attention to the energy efficiency of its properties and the carbon footprint caused by energy consumption



    why is this a priority

    improving the energy efficiency of buildings is an essential element of the eu climate and energy strategy which aims for a 20 per cent decrease
    in the energy consumption of new buildings by 2020 improving the energy efficiency of buildings and reducing emissions plays a key role in
    achieving that aim as construction activity and energy consumption during the use of buildings together represent over 40 per cent of final
    energy consumption in 2021 all new buildings must meet near zero energy standards

    as tenant activity causes up to 60 per cent of the total energy consumption of a building cooperation between the landlord and tenant is of
    crucial importance in reducing energy consumption every day nearly 30000 people work in premises owned by sponda which means that even
    small acts can result in major changes


    sponda strives to reach the eu targets through its own operations and through cooperation with clients energy efficiency is an important
    consideration in all of the companys property development projects as well as renovation and maintenance operations sponda also provides
    guidance and encourages its clients to be energy efficient and to take environmental aspects into consideration in the use of properties


    the figures for environmental responsibility are based on spondas properties located in finland from which data is collected regarding energy
    and water consumption and waste management there is a certain degree of annual variability in spondas property holdings due to sales and
    purchases which affects the comparability of the annual environment figures



    improving energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint at sponda

    the key aspects of the priority are


     the consumption of heat electricity and water in buildings
     property development
     increasing environmental awareness among clients and employees



    certification and spondas planning guidelines

    at sponda new construction property renovation and the design of office buildings are all subject to the companys planning guidelines which
    are in many ways more extensive than the generally applied standards and regulations the guidelines help the company develop adaptable and
    energy efficient properties that offer good physical working conditions for tenants and users


    sponda pays particular attention to environmental requirements in its property development operations by applying for environmental
    certification for new buildings and major renovation projects the company can offer its clients highquality business premises that are
    environmentally friendly



    energy efficiency scheme

    the energy efficient use of properties is supported particularly through spondas energy efficiency scheme originally launched in 2009 the
    scheme is aimed at achieving energy savings in cooperation with clients


    the energy efficiency scheme starts with an energy review at the premises to determine the energy consumption of each property and to
    examine the different technical systems relating to energy consumption energy efficiency goals and measures for achieving them are set
    individually for each property in cooperation with the users developments are then monitored in regular meetings with clients spondas partners
    ovenia oy and corbel oy are responsible for property maintenance operations and for collecting and monitoring energy consumption data


    the cost savings achieved through the energy efficiency scheme are reinvested in the properties the goal of the scheme is a 10 per cent
    reduction in energy consumption by 2016 sponda will expand its cooperation with clients in the future to reduce the overall environmental load of
    properties by paying attention to not only energy consumption but also other environmental factors related to the property and client operations



    environmental awareness in daytoday work

    spondas head office in helsinki was granted wwfs green office certification in 2010 in recognition of the high extent to which environmental
    aspects are taken into consideration in office work sponda uses the green office programme to promote the environmental expertise of
    personnel and guide employees in making environmentally sound choices environmental awareness is increased for example through an annual

    sponda reports to the wwf annually on the energy consumption of its head office the company takes an active approach to reducing the
    energy consumption and other environmental load of its head office building in 2011 energy consumption at spondas head office decreased
    compared to 2010 electricity consumption declined by 14 per cent heating consumption weatheradjusted by 9 per cent and district cooling by
    109 per cent the buildings water consumption fell by 16 per cent from the previous year


    spondas employees are encouraged to make ecological choices through a company car policy that supports lowemission options employees
    are also provided with company bicycles as part of spondas green office environmental programme employees are also trained in economical
    driving the company makes shared public transport tickets available to employees who need to travel in helsinki metropolitan area during the
    working day

    objectives for 2011
     energy efficiency scheme will be continued
     international environmental certification application process will be initiated for all new construction projects
     concept for lowenergy commercial buildings will be applied in all new build property development projects
     environmental impacts consumptions will be reduced
     expanded monitoring of the environmental indicators in russia



    measures taken in 2011

    more properties covered by the energy efficiency scheme


    at the end of 2011 there were a total of 113 2010 84 properties included in the energy efficiency scheme an energy review had been
    conducted at 83 of these properties and action proposals drafted for 49 properties the energy efficiency scheme has also been initiated at
    three properties owned by real estate funds managed by sponda


    for properties that joined the programme in 2010 energy reviews continued a part of recommended actions were taken and consumption was
    monitored in accordance with propertyspecific action plans certain measures were implemented in cooperation with property users while some
    of the measures will be implemented in conjunction with major renovation projects


    the results of the energy reviews under the companys russian energy efficiency scheme launched in 2010 were compiled and analysed in
    2011 energy efficiency goals and measures for achieving them will be set individually for each property based on the results of the energy
    reviews


    energy savings were achieved in spondaowned properties over the course of 2011 partly thanks to the energy efficiency scheme however
    the exceptional weather conditions in finland made it difficult to monitor consumption for the part of adjusted or weathercorrected heating
    energy the adjusted energy consumption of comparable properties remained nearly the same 02 per cent while the measured heat
    consumption decreased by 185 per cent in actuality in comparable properties overall electricity consumption decreased by 23 per cent water
    consumption decreased by 48 per cent and cooling consumption decreased by 10 per cent


    the carbon footpring caused by the total energy consumption of all of spondas properties was 56080 tonnesco2 2010 60048 which
    represents a decrease of 66 per cent compared to the previous year


    in order to improve the monitoring and reporting of the consumption of its properties sponda further expanded realtime consumption monitoring
    and remote reading of electricity consumed by the building as well as heating cooling and water consumption


    in 2011 sponda joined a voluntary action plan related to property sectors energy efficiency agreement to promote the energy efficiency of
    business premises tets the aim of the framework agreement is to reduce the energy consumption of participating properties by 6 per cent by
    2016

    environmental awareness among clients increased


    in order to strengthen its cooperation with clients on environmental matters sponda proposed an environmental partnership to ten clients in 2011
    with the aim of improving the energy efficiency and waste recycling rate of business premises while taking clients individual needs into
    consideration in the partnerships particular attention is paid to the environmental effects of the clients operations sponda and the clients that
    enter into an environmental partnership agree on a casespecific basis what the objectives of the partnership are and how the cooperation will be
    implemented at the turn of the year new partnerships were launched with kesko in ruoholahti shopping centre elisa nordea evli bank plc
    the city of espoo national board of patents and registration in finland and the cancer society of finland to name a few


    spondas environmental communications aimed at clients were increased significantly in 2011 the companys redesigned extranet services give
    clients guidance on energy efficient operations and waste sorting and also includes information on the progress of the energy efficiency scheme
    clients can also use the extranet to monitor the energy consumption of their property environmental content on the company website was also
    expanded with the addition of environmental tips courtesy of spondas partner wwf finland


    customer communications will be further improved in 2012 by organising environmental events at clients premises in partnership with wwf
    finland the goal is to increase environmental awareness among the users of spondas properties and to encourage clients to take
    environmentally friendly action in their daily operations



    international environmental certification for four properties


    by seeking certification for its newly built or renovated properties sponda looks to offer its customers highquality and environmentally friendly
    business premises interest in propertyspecific international environmental certificates has increased significantly in recent times sponda
    decided in early 2011 to apply for environmental certification for all of its newly constructed properties


    a total of four spondaowned properties were granted international environmental classification in 2011


     an office building completed in 2008 and located in helsinki at sörnäistenkatu 2 was granted leed silver environmental certification for an
      existing building
     an office building completed in 2011 as part of the citycenter block in helsinkis central business district was granted leed gold
      environmental certification
     ruoholahden tähti an office building completed in 2008 in helsinkis ruoholahti district was granted breeaminusecertification
     port gate an office building completed in 2008 in helsinkis vuosaari harbour was granted breeaminusecertification


    as of the beginning of 2012 sponda has certification processes pending at seven properties or property development projects the currently on
    going certification processes will continue in 2012 and the certification application process will be initiated for all new construction projects also in
    the future


    in 2011 sponda updated its planning guidelines to take the requirements and instructions of international environmental classification systems
    into account the guidelines apply to all of spondas new construction and renovation projects



    commitment to industry agreements and participation in associations


    sponda aims to promote environmental responsibility through active participation in property and construction industry organisations and their
    environmental initiatives on the property development front the company strives to promote sustainable development through its membership in
    the green building council finland russian green building council and rakli the finnish association of building owners and construction
    clients


    in 2011 sponda was involved in a project to compose guidelines for construction of a lowenergy commercial building the project was
    coordinated by the finnish association of civil engineers ril which published guidelines for lowenergy commercial construction in early 2012
    sponda will also continue developing its own concept for a lowenergy commercial buildings based on the ril guidelines

    estimates of the carbon footprint from energy consumption in properties in 2009 and 2010 are based on the specific emission coefficients reported by energy companies for

    2009

    areas have been recalculated in 2010




    in brief
        spondas environmental communications aimed at clients were increased and the extranet service was improved
        four spondaowned properties were granted international environmental classification
        sponda participated in the development of energy efficiency in the property sector for instance through being involved in the drafting of the
         lowenergy construction planning guide led by the association of finnish civil engineers ril




    material efficiency
    material efficiency is part of spondas comprehensive approach to environmental responsibility spondas efforts in the area of
    material efficiency are particularly focused on waste sorting and providing instructions for waste sorting



    why is this a priority

    in 2008 the finnish government approved a national waste plan aimed at reducing waste generation and achieving a reduction in the total
    annual volume of municipal waste by 2016 the objective of the plan is to have less than 20 per cent of municipal waste end up in landfill sites
    with the remaining 80 per cent recycled or used for energy generation sponda aims to contribute to the overall effort to reach the goals of the
    national waste plan through its own operations



    material efficiency in sponda

    the key aspects of the priority


       the sorting and recycling of property waste
       improving efficiency in material use also in purchasing
       producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental effects


    while the appropriate sorting of waste is the responsibility of the users of properties sponda aims to facilitate convenient and effective sorting of
    waste at its properties through its own operations and by ensuring that the necessary waste sorting facilities are in place the company arranges
    for postsorting waste management at its properties unless otherwise agreed with tenants sponda guides the users of its properties in waste
    recycling and sorting as well as in the reduction of waste volume


    reducing the volume of waste generation is an integral aspect of material efficiency spondas construction and renovation projects take this
    aspect into account by incorporating flexible and adaptable spatial solutions in building design this reduces the need for subsequent alterations
    that produce further construction waste

    in the construction phase of new buildings and major renovation projects the company has adopted onsite waste management guidelines
    according to the international leed and breeam certification systems in order to reduce the volume of waste requiring disposal in all
    construction and renovation projects and in the daily use of the companys properties the aim is to minimise the volume of waste ending up at
    landfill sites by ensuring the appropriate sorting and recycling of waste


    in addition to the waste sorting and providing instructions for sorting sponda will focus increasingly on reducing the volume of waste as well as
    producing services with fewer material inputs and lower environmental impact


    more information on property certification



    objectives for 2011
     the total waste volume will decrease and the monitoring will improve


    measures taken in 2011

    in 2011 sponda paid particular attention to waste sorting and recycling as well as monitoring the volume of waste sponda aims to ensure that
    tenants have appropriate waste sorting facilities at their disposal the company has also made waste sorting instructions available to customers
    on its extranet services and offers buildingspecific guidance at certain properties


    sponda encourages its customers to waste sorting and recycling also with its environmental partner programme which aims to reduce the
    environmental load resulting from the use of properties the partnership was started in 2011 among others with kesko in ruoholahti shopping
    centre elisa nordea bank finland plc the city of espoo evli bank plc national board of patents and registration in finland and the cancer
    society of finland


    in 2011 sponda improved its reporting of waste volumes in cooperation with subcontractors more comprehensive reporting enables the
    company to better communicate with the users of its properties on the volume and type of waste generated spondas total waste volume in 2011
    was 5610 tonnes of which 2371 was mixed waste the volume of mixed waste will be further reduced by improving waste sorting


    sponda improved waste recycling at its properties in the beginning of 2012 by signing a cooperation agreement with lassila  tikanoja the new
    cooperation agreement is expected to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions from properties owned by sponda by some 300 tonnes per month
    and increase the recycling ratio to approximately 90 per cent it is further estimated that the volume of waste ending up at landfill sites will decline
    to one tenth of current levels



    objectives for 2012
     environmental partnerships with clients will be increased
     spondas properties in finland recycling ratio of waste increased to over 70 per cent

 epra niy and toppedup niy

 the epra net initial yield niy and toppedup niy represent the annual net yield on investment property on the date of closing the books

 the annual computational net yield is the annualised rental yield for the month of closing the books adjusted by the effect of known rent increases on the
 following years yield deducted by the predicted 12month maintenance costs of comparable properties

 the annual computational adjusted net yield is calculated by making an adjustment to the annual computational net yield in respect of the annualised effect of
 rentfree periods and graded rents for the coming year

interest arises when the group holds more than half of the voting power or when the group holds the right to control the companys business and
financial principles in order to extract benefit from its operations


ifrs 3 business combinations is applied to acquisitions in which a business is acquired mutual ingroup holdings have been eliminated by the
acquisition method the consideration transferred and the detailed assets and accepted liabilities of the acquired company are measured at fair
value goodwill is recorded as the sum of consideration transferred interest of noncontrolling shareholders in the acquiree and previously held
interest in the acquiree minus the fair value of the acquired net assets


acquisitions that do not fall within the definition of a business are recognized as acquired assets


the classification by sponda of individual acquisitions of investment properties as acquired assets is based on the view that a single property
and its lease agreements do not form a business entity the real estate business also requires marketing and development activities for
properties management of tenancies and management of property repairs and renovation acquisitions of investment property classified as
assets do not involve the transfer of business processes or employees


the results of subsidiaries sold during the financial period are consolidated until the date that control in them ceases subsidiaries acquired
during the financial period are consolidated from the date that control commenced


joint ventures and mutual real estate companies whose shares carry entitlement to control over specified premises and in which the groups
holding is less than 100 percent are consolidated in the groups financial statements row by row in proportion to the groups holding in these
companies as jointly controlled assets in accordance with ias 31 interests in joint ventures the consolidated financial statements contain the
groups share of the assets liabilities gains and losses of joint ventures


subsidiaries that are not mutual real estate companies are consolidated using the purchase method the share of profits and equity belonging to
external shareholders is shown as minority interest


associated companies are companies in which the group exercises considerable influence ie when the group has more than 20 but less
than 50 of the votes or the group otherwise exercises considerable influence but does not have a controlling interest they are consolidated
using the equity method the groups share of the results of associated companies is presented as a separate item in the income statement


all intragroup transactions receivables liabilities and profit distributions are eliminated

above operating profit


the revenue and expense items in the comprehensive income statements and separate income statements of foreign group companies are
translated into euros using the average rate for the financial year and balance sheets using the rate on the balance sheet date which gives rise
to a translation difference that is recorded in the balance sheet in shareholders equity and the change in this is recorded in other comprehensive
income translation differences arising from the elimination of the acquisition cost of foreign subsidiaries and from equity items accumulated after

investment properties

investment properties are properties held by the company for the purpose of earning rental income or for capital appreciation or both sponda
measures its investment properties using the fair value method as stated in ias 40 investment property under which the profit or loss from
changes in fair values is recognized through profit and loss in the period in which it is incurred


investment properties are valued initially at acquisition cost including transaction costs in measurements after the initial recognition the fair
value is used the fair value is the sum of money for which the property could change hands between parties who know the business wish to
carry out the transaction and are independent of each other if a reliable market price is not available the value can be determined using
discounted cash flows


the fair value of completed business properties is calculated by sponda itself using the discounted cash flows method dcf cash flows are
calculated over a period of at least 10 years net cash flows in the period and the terminal value are discounted from the end of each accounting
year to the assessment date the terminal value is calculated by capitalizing the net cash flow of the year following the most recent accounting
year with the required yield gordon growth model the discount rate is determined by adding the expected longterm rate of inflation to the
required yield the yield is based on spondas own assessment of the market situation and on information from published sources including kti
finland institute for real estate economics


potential gross income is based on current lease contracts and in the case of vacant premises on estimated market rent levels potential gross
income per property is adjusted annually by the estimated longterm vacancy rate taking into account any special aspects related to the property
itself and the status of the lease contract the estimated impact of inflation is calculated on maintenance expenses and on market and contract
leases


the value of nondeveloped sites and unused but usable building rights is determined using the sales price method


spondas internal property assessment process calculation methods and reporting are audited by an external valuer and are considered to fulfil
the valuation criteria of the ifrss and ivs international valuation standards as well as the aka finnish authorized real estate auditors criteria
for good property valuation practice in addition to auditing sponda also commissions at least twice a year an external valuer to examine the
material used in calculating the market value of the property portfolio in order to confirm that the parameters and values used are based on
market indications


an investment property is derecognized from the balance sheet when it is divested or taken permanently out of use gains and losses on sales of
investment properties are presented as a separate item in the income statement



investment properties for development

the acquisition cost for an investment property built by the company itself consists of the construction costs capitalized borrowing costs and
other costs accumulated by the completion date


development projects in which a new building or extension to a building is being constructed and that are unfinished at the balance sheet date
are valued in accordance with ias 40 investment properties at fair value

the risk arising from the incomplete state of the property  which refers to the risk relating to construction costs the construction schedule
financial costs and the yield requirement of the potential buyer of the unfinished property  is taken into account when determining the fair value
of an unfinished property by not recognizing the riskweighted portion of the margin to be obtained on the property corresponding to the
remaining construction time all other risks relating to the unfinished property including those relating to the leasing of the property are taken
into account in the same way as when valuing other investment properties

in the acquiree minus the fair value of the acquired net assets goodwill is not amortized but tested annually or more often for impairment


for impairment testing goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units which are expected to obtain synergy benefits from combining business


if there is any indication of impairment the recoverable amount is allocated to the cash generating unit to which the goodwill belongs ie in
sponda to the above mentioned development projects the recoverable amount is compared to the units carrying amount and an impairment
loss is recognized if the recoverable amount is smaller than the carrying amount the impairment loss is recognized in the income statement and
it cannot be reversed at a later date testing is described in more detail in the section accounting policies requiring managements judgment and
key sources of estimating uncertainty


other intangible assets include computer software recorded at acquisition cost and amortized on a straightline basis over 3 years



trading properties

trading properties are properties that are meant for sale and which do not correspond to the companys strategic targets owing to their size
location or type trading properties are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling price

when a trading property becomes an investment property that is measured in the balance sheet at fair value the difference between the fair
value on the transfer date and its previous carrying amount is recognized in the profit or loss under profitloss on sales of trading assets



impairment of assets

at each balance sheet date the group assesses the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether any indication of impairment exists if
any such indication exists the recoverable amount is estimated with respect to goodwill the recoverable amount is always estimated annually
regardless of whether there are indications of impairment or not


the recoverable amount is the fair value of the asset less cost to sell impairment losses are recognized in the income statement when the
carrying amount of the asset is higher than its recoverable amount an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in circumstances
and the recoverable amount of the asset has increased after the date when the impairment loss was recognized an impairment loss is not
reversed however to an extent higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized in
prior years impairment losses recognized for goodwill are never reversed



financial assets and liabilities

in accordance with ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement sponda groups financial assets are classified as follows
financial assets recognized at fair value through profit and loss loans and receivables and availableforsale financial assets correspondingly
financial liabilities are classified as financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit and loss and financial liabilities measured at
amortized cost financial assets and liabilities are classified on the basis of the purpose for which they were acquired and on the original
acquisition date financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value based on the consideration received or paid transaction costs are
included in the original carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities for items that are not measured at fair value through profit and loss all
purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on the transaction date


financial assets are derecognized from the balance sheet when the group has lost the contractual right to the cash flows or when it has
transferred a significant part of the risks and yield outside the group


financial assets recognized at fair value through profit and loss contain assets held for trading held for trading financial assets have been
acquired mainly to obtain profit from shortterm changes in market prices held for trading assets include derivatives to which hedge accounting
as described in ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement is not applied financial assets held for trading and that mature
within 12 months are included in other current assets the items in this category are measured at fair value and the fair value of all the
investments in this category is determined on the basis of publicly quoted prices or generally accepted option pricing models realized and
unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are
incurred


payments relating to loans and receivables are fixed or determinable they are not quoted on the active market and the company does not hold
them for trading purposes this category includes the groups financial assets that have been obtained by handing over cash goods or services
to a debtor they are valued at amortized cost and are included in current or noncurrent financial assets in noncurrent assets if they mature in
more than 12 months time the group recognizes an impairment loss for an individual receivable if there is objective evidence that the receivable
will not be recovered in full


availableforsale financial assets are assets that are not part of derivative assets and have been specifically allocated to this category or have
not been allocated to any other category they belong to noncurrent financial assets if it is planned to keep them for more than 12 months from
the balance sheet date otherwise they are included in current financial assets changes in the fair value of availableforsale financial assets are
recognized in other comprehensive income and are presented in the fair value reserve after tax changes in fair value are taken from equity to
the income statement when the investment is sold or its value has fallen so that an impairment loss has to be recognized the group had no
availableforsales financial assets on the balance sheet date


financial liabilities recognized at fair value through profit and loss are financial liabilities held for trading the held for trading category also

costs into account the financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method financial liabilities

derivative instruments and hedge accounting

sponda uses derivative contracts mainly to hedge its interest rate risk exposure interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments for
future interest flows and the group applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain such contracts when they meet the hedge accounting criteria
under ias 39


the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps is recognized in equity to the extent that hedging is effective the ineffective nonqualifying
portion of the hedging is recognized immediately in financial items in the income statement


should an interest rate swap used as a hedging instrument mature be sold or terminated prematurely but it is highly probable that the hedged
cash flows will be realized the gains and losses accrued from the derivative contracts remain under equity until they are realized at which point
they are recognized in the income statement if it is no longer highly probable that the hedged cash flows will be realized the gains and losses
accrued from the derivative contracts are taken immediately from equity to financial income and expenses in the income statement


derivatives that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria are recognized through profit and loss they are measured at fair value and changes
in their fair value are recognized in the income statement

payment plus the present value of the nonguaranteed residual value


the leases collected by sponda are total leases separate capital and maintenance leases or leases indexed to the lessees net sales

and liabilities apart from the initial recognition of acquisitions of individual assets as referred to in ias 1215b for which no deferred tax is
recorded a deferred tax asset is also not recorded where the fair value of an individual asset falls below the acquisition cost and a corresponding
deferred tax liability has not been recorded for the original acquisition in sponda these acquired assets are typically investment property
acquisitions which do not meet the criteria of business entities and are therefore classified as assets

    significant effect on the deferred taxes recorded on investment properties on spondas consolidated financial statements


    ias 1 presentation of financial statements amendment effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 july 2012 the most significant

financial liabilities have been included in the new standard in their existing form the effects of the new standard on the consolidated financial

accounting policies requiring managements judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty

spondas management exercises judgment when taking decisions about the choice of accounting policies for the financial statements and their
application this concerns in particular situations in which the ifrs standards have alternatives for recognition measurement or presentation


the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with ifrss requires management to some extent to make estimates and assumption
that affect the recognition of assets liabilities income and expenses the estimates and assumptions are based on earlier experience and the
best understanding on the balance sheet date actual results may differ from the estimates


in sponda managements judgment estimates and assumptions mainly concern the fair value measurement of investment properties
impairment testing for goodwill recognition of deferred taxes and provisions


determining the fair value of investment properties using the discounted cash flows method is a key element in the financial statements and
requires significant management estimates and understanding especially concerning future developments in yield requirements market rental
rates and occupancy rates the fair value of investment properties reflects among other things the rental income based on existing leases as
well as reasonable and wellfounded estimates of future rental income made by knowledgeable willing parties in the light of current conditions it
also reflects expected future cash payments related to each property in question the yield requirement is determined for each property taking
into account the propertyspecific risks and the market risk the discount rate is determined by adding the expected longterm rate of inflation to
the required yield


impairment testing for goodwill relates to the goodwill allocated to certain development projects planned in the helsinki metropolitan area that
came with the kapiteeli acquisition and are in the property development unit impairment testing requires managements judgment concerning
the costs during construction and the fair value of an investment property when it is completed and is transferred to the category of completed
investment properties


before starting a project the fair value at completion of the investment property being developed is determined using the 10 year discounted
cash flows method with the same variables and parameters as for the fair value of completed investment properties rental income is based
either on leases made in advance with future tenants or on management estimates of future rents and occupancy rates management assesses
the accuracy of the calculations by testing for impairment if there is indication of changes in the estimates and assumptions due to the market or
other reasons the calculations are revised to correspond to the best understanding at the moment of testing the sensitivity of the yield
requirement is also assessed


management also checks that the construction costs for the project stay within the prepared cost estimate if there are indications of a rise in
costs or of other causes as a result of which costs may be exceeded the values are updated


deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for all temporary differences between the book values and the carrying amounts for tax
purposes of assets and liabilities apart from the initial recognition of acquisitions of individual assets as referred to in ias 1215b for which no
deferred tax is recorded a deferred tax asset is also not recorded where the fair value of an individual asset falls below the acquisition cost and a
corresponding deferred tax liability has not been recorded at the time of the original acquisition management has exercised judgment such that
individual acquisitions of investment properties at sponda are classified as acquired assets since a single property and its lease agreements do
not form a business entity to constitute a business entity they would require related marketing and development activities as well as
management of tenancies property repairs and renovation acquisitions of investment property classified as assets do not involve the transfer of
business processes or employees

the most important temporary difference in sponda is the difference between the fair values of the investment properties and their carrying
amounts for tax purposes the carrying amount for tax purposes is the value of the asset in the property company other temporary differences
arise for example from tax losses carried forward provisions and financial instruments a deferred tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences or unused tax losses can be utilized it may
become necessary to decrease the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if future taxable income differs from the estimate

 disposed of within a set period of their receipt the duration of this period is two years for the oneyear vesting periods and three years for the threeyear
 vesting periods the personnel covered by the scheme also have a continued obligation to hold shares received under the scheme at a minimum amount
 corresponding to their gross annual salary for the duration of their employment in the company

 the acquisition of kapiteeli oy in 2006 resulted in goodwill of eur 275 million being allocated to certain planned development projects which were
 considered to have great potential for increase in value upon completion some of these were completed in 2008 the goodwill allocated to the completed
 projects was written down corresponding to the change in fair value during 2008 and it had an impact on the result of eur 130 million goodwill and related
 writedowns were entirely allocated to the property development segment

 the remaining eur 145 million of goodwill has been tested by comparing the future cash flows of the asset containing goodwill to the carrying value of the
 goodwill cash flows have been discounted using an interest rate of 880 2010 924 based on the impairment testing there is no need for further
 writedowns on goodwill

 before starting a project the fair value at completion of the investment property being developed is determined using the 10 year discounted cash flows
 method with the same variables and parameters as for the fair value of completed investment properties rental income is based either on leases made in
 advance with future tenants or on management estimates of future rents and occupancy rates management assesses the accuracy of the calculations by
 testing for impairment if there is indication of changes in the estimates and assumptions due to the market or other reasons the calculations are revised to
 correspond to the best understanding at the moment of testing the sensitivity of the yield requirement to change is also assessed

 management also checks that the construction costs for the project remain within the prepared cost estimate if there are indications of a rise in costs or of
 other causes as a result of which costs may be exceeded the values are updated

 counterparty banks in addition sponda plc checks the assessments using assessing methods that are generally available on the market the fair values and
 nominal values of interest rate derivatives are presented in note 313

 interest rate derivatives have been defined as cash flow hedging or as derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting sponda applies group
 hedging in which the behaviour of the loan portfolio is compared with the interest rate derivative portfolio the interest rate derivative portfolio is divided into
 interest rate options and interest rate swaps in addition sponda may use forward rate agreements and interest rate futures to which hedge accounting is not
 applied

 at the time of closing the books sponda applied hedge accounting to all interest swap agreements the interest swap agreements mature in 20122016
 during which time also the interest flows resulting from the interest swap agreements will be realised the hedging efficiency between the loans hedged in the
 financial year 2011 and the hedging instruments was very good the inefficient portion of interest swap agreements included in hedge accounting is recorded
 in a manner affecting the result hedge accounting was not applied to interest rate limit options bought the change in the current value of interest rate limit
 options is also recorded in a manner affecting the result

 net lossesgains for the period recognised in other comprehensive income items are presented under consolidated statement of comprehensive income more
 information on their recognition is available in the section on accounting principles hedge accounting is applied to interest derivatives satisfying the ias 39
 criteria for hedge accounting throughout their maturity

 sponda plc analyses its interest rate position by simulating changes in market interest rates the treasury unit calculates a forecast of interest expenses for
 the coming year and its interest rate sensitivity the following assumptions have been made when calculating the sensitivity to change in interest rates
  the shortterm market rates at the stated balance sheet date change by one percentage point
  the calculation includes interestbearing liabilities eur 1761 million 1573
  the calculation includes current derivative contracts eur 1537 million 1423

 the calculation aims to measure the impact of shortterm market rates on the interest expenses of the companys loans and correspondingly on the interest
 income to be obtained from interest rate derivatives or on the interest costs to be paid in the following year the figures are presented net the financial
 instruments used in the calculation are accounted for in accordance with the ifrs definitions mentioned in the companys accounting principles for the
 financial statements the interest rates used are the official interest rates quoted on the last banking day on the balance sheet date

 in its 2011 financial statements sponda plc applied hedge accounting to 63 of interest rate derivatives compared to 58 in 2010 in the sensitivity analysis
 changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives to which hedge accounting is not applied are presented in full through profit and loss the groups interest
 bearing liabilities decreased during 2011 by about eur 182 million

 2 liquidity and refinancing risk

 the group seeks to continuously assess and monitor the amount of financing required by its business operations to ensure the sufficiency of liquid funds for
 financing purposes and to repay maturing loans the risk related to access to finance is reduced by making financial contracts with several financial sources
 and using a variety of financial instruments the group seeks to spread the maturity of its new borrowings so that as loans mature the amount needing
 refinancing each year remains stable the groups single largest creditor represents approximately one fifth of the groups total interestbearing liabilities the
 groups largest creditors are nordic banks with which the company has a longterm customer relationship sponda expects to be able to renew the loans that
 fall due notes 314 and 315 show the maturity analysis based on the groups agreements the average loan period of the groups loans on 31 december
 2011 was 31 years 31 december 2010 32 years

 for shortterm financing purposes the company uses a commercial paper programme the size of the commercial paper programme is eur 350 million the
 groups loans maturing in 2012 total some eur 375 million of which a bond maturing in may represents eur 219 million the remainder of the loans
 maturing in 2012 are loans from financial institutions if the company so desires it can pay off the debts maturing in 2012 by for example withdrawing long
 term credit limits with a total unwithdrawn amount at the time of closing of the books that was eur 440 million 425 there is still strong interest in the
 companys commercial papers which is why the company aims to keep the commercial paper volume issued approximately at the current level

 the group assures its liquidity with sufficient credit limits and bank account limits the credit limits also provide a reserve for the commercial paper
 programme unused long term credit limits totalled eur 440 million on the balance sheet date in 2011 the company replaced the credit limit of a eur 200
 million loan that was originally due to mature in 2012 with eur 100 million and eur 50 million longterm limits in addition the group had unused account
 based limits for a total of eur 10 million according to the financing policy confirmed by the board of directors cash surplus is invested in the market in short
 term financial instruments or bank savings on 31 december 2011 the groups cash and cash equivalents totalled eur 264 million 270

 in addition the risks relating to access to finance are reduced by maintaining the companys reputation as a trustworthy debtor spondas financial contracts
 contain normal covenants to protect the creditors which concern for example the equal status of financiers certain financial indicators and the use of
 collateral the most important covenants used are

  the interest coverage ratio ebitdanet interest cost for which the minimum acceptable ratio is 175 the ratio on the closing date was 27 30

  the equity ratio for which the set minimum ratio is 28 on the closing date the equity ratio stood at 38 39

  the group was not in breach of covenants during the financial year



 3 credit risk

 credit risk arises from the possibility that the counterparty in a contract fails to fulfil their obligations as given in the contract the groups most significant credit
 risks at the balance sheet date arose from investments in the money markets from derivative contracts and from rent receivables and trade receivables the
 group has no major concentrations of receivables or credit risks

 to avoid risks from counterparties the group uses only financially solid banks with a good credit rating as counterparties in its money market investments and
 derivative contracts the banks credit rating must be classified as at least a by sp or a similar credit rating company sponda plc may invest in the
 commercial papers issued by wellknown financially solid companies operating in finland sponda plcs board of directors decides on acceptable
 counterparties on counterparty limits and on the permitted financial instruments in derivative trading sponda plc observes the stipulations given by isda
 international swaps and derivatives association inc or the finnish bankers association with counterparties the maximum amount of the credit risk is the
 carrying amount of the financial assets and the positive fair value of derivatives and details of the combined total of these eur 593 milion are given in note
 311

 the risk arising from tenants is managed by analysing the creditworthiness of tenants before leases are signed by requiring rent deposits and by the monthly
 collection of rent the business units responsible for leasing properties are responsible for arranging collateral for rents the maximum amount of the risk is the
 total carrying amount of the receivables less the amount of the collateral total collateral for rents received amounted to eur 37 million collateral for rent is
 primarily in the form of bank deposits or bank guarantees collateral is not however required for separately approved counterparties such as the finnish state
 or municipalities collateral received in fulfillment of lease obligations may be used to cover the companys receivables without hearing the tenant on the
 matter ovenia oy monitors the groups rent receivables

 the total amount of rent receivables on the balance sheet date was eur 32 million the total rent unpaid for more than three months was eur 13 million
 the group recorded credit losses of eur 11 million for rent receivables in 2011 the group recognises a final credit loss when a tenant is found to be without
 means in the debt collection process or when the companys share of a bankruptcy is confirmed the group uses wellknown external debtcollection firms to
 collect receivables

 the collateral for a selling price receivable is almost always a real security the real security for selling price receivables is typically real estate mortgages for
 the sold property or shares at the time of closing the books the group had sales price receivables in the amount of eur 14 million the total sales
 receivables at the time of closing the books excluding rent receivables was eur 21 million the group considers the risk related to sales receivables as low a
 maturity analysis of all sales receivables is presented on the table in note 24

 in addition the company has given guarantees as security for the commitments of the property companies it owns the guarantees are typically guarantees
 relating to the construction phase of a new company in which the beneficiary is almost always the city the amount of the guarantees eur 36 million is
 small in proportion to the carrying amount of the companies owned the guarantees given are not expected to cause significant costs to the group




 4 currency risk

 the group has international operations in russia changes in the exchange rate between the russian rouble and the euro and between the us dollar and the
 euro may affect sponda groups financial position and operations the group is exposed to currency risk since balance sheet items for foreign subsidiaries
 and revenue and expenses from properties are translated into the business currency of the parent company into euros

 spondas russian companies receive their rents monthly in us dollars in russian roubles or in euros the companies pay most of their expenses in russian
 roubles usddenominated net cash flows from lease agreements are some usd 18 million usd 14 million annually and rubdenominated net cash flows
 some rub 34 million rub 5 million in accordance with the boards decision sponda hedges foreign currency denominated future net cash flows for a
 period of six months the company may use currency denominated forwards options and currency swaps in hedging one currency derivative will mature and
 be renewed in each month during the next six months so that a total corresponding to the net position for six months is always effective

                                                                                                                  annual report 2011          financial statements




 on the balance sheet date the company had currency options to the value of usd 9 million to hedge the usd net cash flows the difference between
 incoming cash flows denominated in russian roubles and outgoing roubledenominated expenses is minor so it has not been considered necessary to hedge
 this net cash flow in accordance with the boards decision sponda does not hedge the translation risk from russian companies if the exchange rate between
 the euro and the usd changed 10 per cent from the closing date the change in the fair value of the currency options would be recognized through profit and
 loss in full if the euro weakened 10 per cent against the usd this would reduce the result by some eur 05 million and if the euro strengthened 10 per cent
 against the usd this would improve the result by some eur 04 million with the the currency derivative maturing each month the company can sell cash
 flow of some usd 15 million based on rental income and this would have the opposite effect on the result to that of the currency option

 the group uses internal euro loans for the financing of investments in russia

 in 2011 the company issued a sek 650 million bond in addition the company converted existing euro denominated loans into sek loans in 2011 for a total of
 eur 265 million sek 2405 million the loans were converted into sek because of permanent cost savings all sek denominated loans are hedged against
 exchange rate risks by means of interest rate and currency swap agreements the net amount of the unrealised exchange rate differences of the sek
 denominated loans and the current value of unrealised interest rate and currency swap agreements hedging the loans may vary during the duration of each
 agreement the changes in profit caused by the unrealised exchange rate differences and unrealised changes in current value decreases over time and
 reaches zero on the due date the sek cash flows received from the interest rate and exchange rate swap agreement cover all future cash flows of the sek
 currency loans and capitals due on the due date

 the company does not apply hedging according to ias 39 to currency derivatives the changes in the current value of currency derivatives are recorded in the
 income statement



 5 managing the equity structure

 the objective of managing the groups equity structure is to optimise the equity structure in relation to prevailing market conditions at any particular time the
 goal is an equity structure that best assures conditions for the groups longterm strategic operations

 factors affecting the groups equity structure in addition to the result include capital expenditure asset sales acquisitions dividend payments equitybased
 facilities and assessment at fair value the groups key covenant in credit arrangements is the equity ratio the companys equity ratio must always be greater
 than 28 in the event that equity ratio approaches the 28 limit the company will carry out arrangements to boost equity the companys equity comprises
 an equity bond hybrid loan that improves the companys equity ratio the nominal value of the hybrid loan is eur 130 million and it is recorded in the balance
 sheet under other equity reserve more information on the hybrid loan is provided in the accounting principles the company aims to distribute a dividend of
 approximately 50 of the periods cash flow from operations per share taking into consideration the aforementioned equity ratio target and the companys
 business development the groups capital structure is also guided by the value of the interest cover ratio covenant interest cover ratio is determined by the
 ratio between ebitda and net interest expenses with gains from sales deducted and losses on sales added changes in the value of property assets are also
 included in the calculation and depreciation and amortisation are deducted the interest cover ratio must be greater than 175

 sponda plcs board of directors has set the groups long term equity ratio target at 40 on 31 december 2011 the groups equity ratio was 38 compared
 to 39 at the end of 2010 spondas interest cover ratio on 31 december 2011 was 27 in 2010 the interest cover ratio was 30 sponda groups interest
 bearing liabilities increased during 2011 by eur 182 million and at the end of the year totalled eur 1755 million sponda group sold property assets during
 2011 for altogether eur 9 million the funds received were used to pay off loans and finance property development investments the formula for calculating
 the equity ratio is shown in the annual report under calculation of financial ratios
