had a common objective  to simplify complicated tasks so that the resulting
efficiencies could be applied elsewhere to achieve loftier goals today when we
develop breakthrough technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning

application of human effort and ingenuity towards finding innovative solutions to
even bigger unsolved problems automation and innovation are intertwined in a
continuous virtuous cycle of progress

if innovation is the engine that powers the vehicle of progress and automation
the fuel that feeds it then education is the context that surrounds them by
sharing our knowledge and experiences with the rest of the world and with future
generations we help to scale and sustain the virtuous cycle taken together

and of ultimate transcendence from human suffering

our commitment to environmental sustainability

economic progress is taking a toll on the limited resources of
our planet we recognize the threats of accelerating global

taken concrete actions to mitigate them in our operations

use of renewable energy and contributing to biodiversity

in 2011 we committed at the united nations to become
carbon neutral reduce per capita electricity consumption
by 50 against the baseline year 2008 and use 100
renewable power for electricity by 2018 we are also a
signatory to the re100 campaign our efforts included
aggressive targets to reduce consumption and switch to
renewable energy resources for our business operations
as of this fiscal we have achieved our per capita electricity
target while we have made significant progress on the other
commitments we may not be able to achieve them in fiscal
2018 because of challenges related to government policies
however we remain committed to these goals and will strive
to achieve them in the nearest future

renewed focus of installing smart building systems
retrofits implementing building designs with an efficient
envelope and renewable energy helped significantly
reduce our per capita energy consumption by 51 since
2008 our buildings deliver an energy performance index
of 75 kwhsq myear among the lowest in the industry
and comparable to the best in the world since 2008 while
our employee strength increased by 143 our electricity
consumption has increased by just 19 through focused
efforts on energy conservation our current electricity

 emissions
1
    per capita emissions is calculated by dividing the gross ghg emissions by the total employee count across operations in india the employee count considered for
    fiscal 2017 is 153461 which is calculated by totaling the swipe count of employees and number of support staff in our offices
2
    employee commute emissions reported include data for india locations which forms a significant portion of our employee base
3
    emissions value for fiscal 2016 have changed in view of the following changes 
      scope 1  the emission factor for high speed diesel and diesel were updated to the third decimal resulting in changes in scope 1 emissions
      scope 2  the energy consumption by third parties construction vendors were included incorrectly in the electricity consumption of infosys during fiscal 2016 and
      fiscal 2015 this has been corrected

the above corrections have resulted in the changes per capita and the yearonyear comparisons for emissions data

the trend of monthly per capita ghg emissions scope 1 and scope 2 for all locations in india over the years is as follows

note  per capita emissions is computed by dividing the gross ghg emissions scope 1  2 in our locations by the average employee count for the month employee
       count is the sum of the swipe count of employees and number of support staff in our offices the average monthly employee count considered for fiscal 2017 is
       153461 and covers all india locations

water
fiscal 201617 saw per capita water reduction by 836 on yearonyear basis this has been achieved with the use of water
efficient fixtures innovative wastewater treatment technologies reuse of treated wastewater rainwater harvesting and smart
water metering for continuous monitoring of consumption today apart from the 270 injection wells and 25 lakes across
campuses we are harvesting roof top rainwater from the buildings in our chennai sholinganallur campus and also the multi
level car park mlcp in our pune campus our goal is to harvest 100 roof top rainwater from all our buildings and use it for
consumption after treatment our innovative smart water metering program enables us to monitor all our water consumption
online on a continuous basis and eliminate water wastage significantly

we have also automated our sewage treatment plant at equinox building bengaluru the system will help us in optimizing
and benchmarking our stps to global standards

rainwater that is collected and directed deep into the ground through injection wells helps to raise the groundwater tables
we harvest rainwater in all our campuses we have constructed 270 deepinjection well systems and 25 lakes for recharging
groundwater with the harvested rainwater

our performance
our fresh water consumption is solely for the purpose            recycle and reuse of wastewater our efforts to reduce
of human sustenance hence we believe that we do not            fresh water consumption includes and is not limited to the
significantly impact water resources we have focused on         installation of pressure reducing valves in taps and pipes
reducing our per capita fresh water consumption through          the use of flow restrictors and installation of sensor taps in
various initiatives                                             high density areas for the current fiscal we have recycled

process optimization
the waste generation patterns are continuously monitored
on our campuses and the process of waste management is
modified accordingly

we have been constantly directing our efforts to treat 100

going out of our campuses we have installed biogas plants
in our campuses to convert food waste into biogas and use
it as cooking fuel at the kitchens in our food courts

biodiversity
in our endeavor to conserve and promote biodiversity we plant diverse species of trees native to the region to support local
fauna native species require less water for growth and also provide a feeding and nesting ground for avian birds this fiscal
we have planted 63066 trees across our campuses

                    the disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are reported in a neutral tone
                    in terms of content and presentation however report could further bring out responses related
                    to the challenges faced during the reporting period at various geolocations of operations in

                    found to be accurate and nothing came to our attention to suggest that reported data have not
                    been properly collated from information reported at operational level nor that the assumptions
                    used were inappropriate
                    some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be
                    attributable to transcription and the errors have been communicated and corrected the key
                    performance indicators relating to the group sustainability objectives have been internally
