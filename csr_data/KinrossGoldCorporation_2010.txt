     developing a corporate responsibility strategy the kinross way

     the development of our new corporate responsibility strategy in 2008 coincided
     with a period of significant growth at kinross as we brought three major new projects
     into production while launching our next growth phase with the acquisition of two
     new development projects including a major investment in a new country ecuador

     this expansion presented kinross with both an opportunity and an obligation to
     build on our solid track record in corporate responsibility by strengthening our
     global framework of policies management systems and practices

     our aim is to establish kinross as a leader in corporate responsibility
     recognizing the critical importance of corporate responsibility both in maintaining
     our social license to operate and in gaining access to and developing quality new mineral deposits around the world

     the strategy is based on
      integrating corporate responsibility into business strategy at each stage of the mine life cycle
      a strong focus on twoway stakeholder engagement and partnerships and
      a systematic and structured approach to managing and measuring corporate responsibility performance across the company
     the strategy builds on kinross ten guiding principles by establishing a policy framework to articulate our commitments in
     specific areas a cr management system that expands our existing ehs management system to include a social management
     system and site responsibility plans for each location focusing on stakeholder engagement community investment and
     other commitments

                                                                                       we believe our new strategy provides a comprehensive

     engaging stakeholders at paracatu

     community engagement is a cornerstone of kinross commitment to responsible mining

     with the expansion of our paracatu
     mine we continued to work closely
     with the community engaging our
     stakeholders on a broad range of issues
     in 2008 we established a stakeholder
     committee with representatives from
     neighbouring communities the paracatu
     residents association and local
     government the committee meets
     monthly to discuss issues and make
     recommendations in key areas including
     environmental monitoring and social
     and environmental initiatives it
     provides important input into the
     operations decisionmaking process       					                                                              2010

     for example in june 2009 it was
     instrumental in helping us develop         visitors                         2732           2585            2700

     blasting at our mine operations

     we also created a 24hour hotline
     called open channel to receive
     and register community complaints
     concerns and suggestions and to
     provide feedback within 24 hours

     as illustrated in the following table

     measuring our benefit footprint

     mining creates wealth in the communities where we operate at a global level and by country this is captured in our reporting
     of economic value generated distributed and retained

     locally beginning in 2010 kinross sites will take this evaluation to another level by tracking what we refer to as the benefit
     footprint this benefit footprint is a measure of the extent to which our operations contribute positively to the sustainability
     of local communities

     measuring the benefit footprint begins with a geographic breakdown of our spending at the local regional national and

engaging our stakeholders

engaging host governments and public stakeholders in a meaningful way is a key pillar of kinross
approach to corporate responsibility engagement is a longterm commitment that requires our strategic
participation in a local communitys ongoing efforts to determine its future from the earliest stages of

 adequate time and opportunities
     for collective decisionmaking and

 proactive exploration of community
     needs and opportunities

given the business we are in and the
fact that our activities can span several
decades engagement with our
stakeholders inevitably includes
challenging conversations and raises
concerns that may be difficult to resolve
we accept these challenges that is the
nature of building longterm trusting
relationships and being good neighbours

in 2009 kinross incorporated stakeholder
engagement as a fundamental aspect

     resettlement

     in 2008 and 2009 kinross paracatu resettled almost 60 rural families as a result of the construction of its tailings dams in the
     machadinho and santa rita regions prior to the resettlement process kinross undertook a comprehensive socioeconomic
     assessment identifying 31 families that would be considered vulnerable due to lack of sufficient education low income or that
     rely on the property as their sole source of income all of these vulnerable individuals received counselling on the options
     available to them which included selling their property to kinross for fair compensation swapping their property for another
     property of greater value provided by kinross or selecting another property and asking the company to buy it and provide
     equivalent infrastructure once an option had been selected each family was provided with extensive assistance to help facilitate
     their move to a new location including finding schools providing health assistance where required supporting elderly people
     who might have difficulty adapting to change and providing access to federal microcredit programs

     the company successfully negotiated compensation with all families satisfying the ifc willing buyerwilling seller criteria the
     individuals affected by the project were willing to sell their property and assets on a voluntary basis the transaction took place with
     the sellers informed consent and the seller was provided with fair compensation based on prevailing market values

     the company provided the necessary financial support to assure that all of those affected by the resettlement were able
     to restore their livelihoods to levels equal to or better than those they maintained at the time of sale some chose to relocate
     to a similar area and continue a similar livelihood in this new location while others decided to move to town and assume an
     urban lifestyle

waste rock management

upon exposure to air the newly exposed
surfaces of waste rock begin to oxidize
if the rock contains sulfides the oxidation
products when washed away can acidify
water and produce what is known as acid
rock drainage uncontrolled acid rock
drainage can have detrimental impacts
on water quality and fisheries recognizing
the risk associated with acid rock drainage
we require each operation to develop
management plans to ensure that waste
rock facilities are both physically and
chemically stable regular monitoring
and inspection is required to verify that

     managing cyanide in russia

     in december 2009 kinross kupol mine was certified under the
     international cyanide management code the first mine in russia
     to obtain this certification kupols transportation group was also
     certified as fully compliant with the cyanide code in november
     making it the first mineoperated transportation group in the
     world to be certified this certification covers the storage and
     transportation of cyanide from the port of pevek facilities to
     kupol by way of a 430kilometre ice road that is built annually
     to transport supplies to the kupol site

     kinross kupol certification demonstrates   harm to the environment especially
     not only its compliance with russias       in regions with untouched nature
     extremely stringent regulatory              such as chukotka it is especially
     requirements for the use and                pleasant to note that kinross gold
     transportation of cyanide but              apart from gaining profit is focused
     confirmation of its management systems      on investing in industrial safety
     and ontheground performance which        certification under the international
     include regular training and drills for     code is the best acknowledgment
     our cyanide response team the              of such efforts our hope is that
     governor of chukotka applauded              certification of the kupol operation will

     delamar reclamation award

     in october 2009 kinross was presented with the us bureau
     of land management blm national hardrock mineral
     environmental award for its reclamation work at the former
     delamar mine site in southwestern idaho this award
     acknowledges operators with an exceptional track record
     of meeting or exceeding reclamation requirements

     when operations were suspended in          and livestock grazing areas on private
     1998 the delamar mine had over            lands a significant amount of work
     seven million cubic metres of water        has gone into water management
     stored in the tailings pond and almost    specifically through the use of an
     170 hectares of disturbed area that        engineered clay cover that is placed
     generated acid rock drainage through      over reactive soils so that new
     a combination of water treatment pit      rainwater wont penetrate the soil and
     backfilling cover placement and other     instead can be released as clean
     reclamation today all of the water at     storm water back into the environment
     delamar has been effectively treated       the reclamation is expected to be
     and returned to the ecosystem             completed in 2012 with water treatment
     primarily through a land application       and monitoring continuing for several
