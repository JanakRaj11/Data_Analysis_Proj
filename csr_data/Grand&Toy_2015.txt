                   it has been a busy year working with our key stakeholders on solutions to help our
                   customers and associates operate business more sustainably seven years since
                   establishing a strong corporate and social responsibility program we consulted
                   with our stakeholders to ensure this was still relevant in todays market all the core
                   principles remain yet our key stakeholders have helped us focus on the two most
                   important sustainability issues to them recycling and green products
                   as a result we have worked with our new parent company office depot to
                   leverage the best sustainability practices from both organizations our green
                   products were reclassified according to office depots industryleading criteria

                   in 2014 grand  toy partnered with terracycle canada becoming the first
                   etailer in canada to offer a recycling solution for coffee capsules such as kcup
                   packs and bringing their zero waste box to our customers this partnership
                   was further expanded in early 2015 by adding zero waste boxes for other waste
                   streams to our offering
                   grand  toys internal practices were also improved the environmental
                   footprint from waste generation was reduced significantly we also continued
                   our sevenyear partnership with start2finish by providing 7500 backpacks for

                   we are focused on increasing our recycling options and the choice of green
                   products while lowering our environmental footprint and engaging with external
                   and internal stakeholders

and managed to decrease the total amount of waste generated in the facility by a factor of eight the following materials are
currently being recycled or reused in the vancouver facility paper cardboard corrugate plastic styrofoam shrink wrap
plastic strapping electronic waste batteries pallets wood chips and organic waste in 2014 the best practices from this
pilot program were applied at other locations resulting in the sharp drop in overall generated waste going to the landfill and
the rise in the recycling rate from 334 in 2013 to 683 in 2014

    green products
    it is the mandate of grand  toy to
    continue to expand our offering and sales
    of environmentally preferable products
    these products were traditionally
    defined as follows

     products that have a minimum of 30
      postconsumer content
     products that carry a recognized thirdparty
      environmental certification
     products that have a traditional attribute that makes
      them better alternatives to standard products
      for instance products made with less input materials than
      traditional alternatives

    green                 green                 green


    in 2014 however more thorough criteria were introduced          as the list of ecoconscious products is expanded it is also
    to define which products are considered environmentally          very important to us that the quality of the products remains
    conscious all green products are now classified according       the same or better than that of products being replaced
    to their environmental attributes created by office depot
                                                                      in 2014 over 2500 grand  toy products were classified as
    and are assigned a light mid or dark green shade these
                                                                      green of which 19 were light green 68 mid green and
    definitions were developed with stakeholder input for every
                                                                      13 dark green about 65 of all green products contained

    were added to the grand  toy website in early 2015




    one of the major green product changes in 2014 was the addition of recycled paper products from rolland enterprises inc
    rollands facilities are located in saintjérôme quebec and utilize carbonneutral biogas energy in production because of this
    and other initiatives rollands environmental footprint is markedly lower than the industry average the environmental impact of
    switching to rolland recycled paper is also measurable grand  toy customers may use the ecocalculator that is available on
    the rolland website

     greenhouse gas footprint
     the greenhouse gas footprint of our facilities increased slightly in 2014 mostly
     attributable to weather trends within the year scope 3 emissions from rented
     locations however was notably reduced after 19 stores were closed in 2014
     not represented in the numbers below
     overall grand  toys carbon footprint has dropped significantly since the
     2010 baseline year while a portion of this decrease was the result of proactive
     initiatives on our part to reduce our impact another portion was the result of
     changes in our business activity due to the economic climate
