in april 2008 temple university signed the american
colleges and universities presidential climate
commitment acupcc a highly visible pledge
to become carbon neutral and accelerate the
development of educational and research efforts
aimed at stabilizing the earths climate

in accordance with the acupcc temple launched
a sustainability initiative across its campuses that
included the                                              the office of sustainability moved
 development of a climate action plan in 2010            to its new location in the howard
 identification of a carbon neutrality date of 2050      gittis student center construc
 submission of annual greenhouse gas inventories          tion debris resulting from the office
    and biennial progress reports and                    interior renovation was recycled
 implementation of sustainability initiatives that
    lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions

on april 20 2016 the university reaffirmed               artist caroline rothwell turned carbon
its commitment by signing the climate                      emissions into art with a stunning tem

strategies  for  addressing climate  change

since signing the acupcc temple has published
an annual report on sustainability to report its
accomplishments in sustainability this is the sixth
annual report and reflects the status of temples
sustainability initiatives as of the end of fiscal year
2016 the report is divided into the three categories
of the climate action plan greenhouse gas reduction
curriculum and research and community outreach




                                                                                                3

greenhouse
gas          temples long range climate action plan
             recommends reducing greenhouse gas
emissions    emissions by 30 in 2030 with interim
             reduction goals of 5 by 2015 15 by 2020
             and 20 by 2025 greenhouse gas emissions
             are attributed to stationary sources fuel
             burned on campus purchased electricity
             transportation solid waste and other
             small contributors refrigerants fertilizers
             purchased steam and transmission and
             distribution losses

             temple measures it greenhouse gas
             emissions annually with fy 2006 as the
             base year from which the university will
             reduce its emissions between fy 2006 and
             fy 2016 greenhouse gas net emissions have
             decreased by 20 from 213149 metric tons
             carbon dioxide equivalent mtco2e to
             170558 mtco2e this decrease occurred
             while the gross square footage gsf
             increased by almost 24 or 2 million gsf
             and the student fulltime equivalent fte
             increased by 27 or 7400 fte students this
             reduction reaches the 2015 goal established
             in the climate action plan

             the fy 2016 greenhouse gas inventory
             showed that the majority of temples
             greenhouse gas emissions were derived
             from buildings stationary sources
             electricity and steam accounting for
             76 of the total since fy 2006 temples
             energy consumption has increased by more
             than 17 therefore implementing energy
             conservation measures and improving
             building energy efficiency continue to be
             a critical step in reaching the universitys
             reduction goals for greenhouse gas
             emissions other greenhouse gas reduction
             goals include transportation waste
             minimization recycling and behavior change
