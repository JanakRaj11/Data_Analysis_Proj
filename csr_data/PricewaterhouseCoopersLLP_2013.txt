in fy07 we set a goal to reduce our carbon footprint by 20 by fy12
in 2011 we met that goal however not long after hitting our goal overall                                120000

we seek to reduce our overall impact however we also track ghg
emissions per staff member to give us another perspective on our progress
between fy07 and fy12 emissions per fulltime employee decreased by
