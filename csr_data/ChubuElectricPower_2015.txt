        disaster management measures                                                           to disasters
     in order to prevent the abnormal release of radioactive substances in the event of a nuclear incident and to suppress and
     mitigate their influence even if these substances are released we are improving the disaster management system and
     procedures and securing necessary materials

                                                                                                           store them for use in emergencies while ensuring the emergency
      disaster management system                                                                           access routes aiming for smooth transportation of necessary

     to strengthen the disaster management system we established
     the risk management department at the nuclear power plant in
     july 2014 further recognizing the importance of making                                               education and drills
     appropriate initial responses to an accident as learned from the
     fukushima daiichi accident we decided to form and station a                                          to ensure the effectiveness of disaster control measures it is
     rapid reaction team of highly experienced members at the power                                        critical to improve the responses made by onsite employees
     plant who will make initial responses as experts in the event of                                     accordingly we are continuously educating them on disaster

         for the prompt handling of an accident we also have                                              training such as companywide emergency drills
     established a system to give reararea support to the nuclear power                                        for individual training we are working to improve the

         electric power and caused damage to local communities we
         apologize to 5700 households for the very troublesome
         blackout caused by the typhoon
             particularly in nagiso town in nagano prefecture the
         mudslide that occurred on the evening of july 9 caused the
         loss of our equipment worse yet the road was blocked by the
         disaster and it took much more time for the recovery of the
         equipment for which all those involved including support                       damage caused by mudslide to nagiso town nagano prefecture
         members dispatched from the group companies made a

                                   saw power poles that had fallen to the ground near the river and thought it would take much time for recovery

                                   it took time for me to reach the site because the mudslide caused the fragmentation of the road and the mud was
                                   piled up to the height of my waist after arriving at the devastated site i made examinations to decide on the
                                   measures to resume power supply as early as possible and cooperated with toenec staff for the recovery work and
                                   the preparation of the power generator vehicle i wanted to supply electricity as soon as possible to relieve the
                                   victims and evacuees worries i still remember the smiles i saw on customers faces when the power was restored

   we will respond steadily to changes in the operational environment including the
   electricity system reforms and the largescale introduction of solar power
   generation while always fulfilling our public mission of stable power supply
    the electricity system reforms will result in the full liberalization of the retail market in april 2016 and the
    introduction of a licensing system the supplydemand structure is also greatly changing due to the
    expanded use of solar power generation
        the power system operations department is making preparations to steadily respond to changes in the
    operational environment while fulfilling its unchanging public mission of stable power supply specifically
    we are working to improve the operational structure renew the supplydemand planning system and
    secure the ability to maintain a good supplydemand balance in the predicted expansion of the use of

  we will bravely take on challenges in the greatly changing environment
   it is our unchanging mission to deliver energy to customers at reasonable prices and in a stable manner but we
   cannot fulfill this mission without the courage to take on challenges in the dramatically changing environment
         fuels account for about a half of the ordinary expenses and we must ensure the stability and flexibility
   of fuel procurement to meet dramatically changing demand it is therefore not an exaggeration to say that
   the successful fulfillment of our mission depends on successful fuel procurement
         against this backdrop chubu electric power launched a new company jera by forming a
   comprehensive alliance with tokyo electric power thereby taking a preparatory step to
   implement more aggressive measures to establish an energy supply system that helps us to
   survive fiercer competition in the international market the fuels department will play a core
   role in this context and make an allout effort to fulfill its mission of procuring fuel in a
   stable and flexible manner at lower prices

   we are aiming to become the no 1 in the thermal power generation business
   it is expected that competition among power generators will intensify as the electricity system
   reforms progress
        however we should continue to supply electricity at reasonable prices and in a safe and stable
   manner into the future while working to fulfill this unchanging mission we should create new value
   for customers by providing them with more diversified services based on a highly competitive power
   source portfolio so that we can continue to be a company selected by customers
        to this end we will increase staff productivity and reduce repair costs in an accelerated manner
   while ensuring stable power supply at the same time we will make strategic investments based on

     power stations
     electricity generated at power stations is transmitted to
     distributing substations the power transmission facilities
     are composed of transmission lines as well as transmission
     line towers and other support structures
         to ensure a stable power supply we have been
     appropriately designing and building facilities with enough
     resistance against natural threats such as lightning and
     snow while introducing technologies to prevent
     equipment failures
         we are also appropriately and steadily updating the
     older facilities which are increasing in number thereby
     ensuring stable supply and public security

  message from an outsider director                   yoshifumi iwata honorary advisor ibiden co ltd



                                                                                                                                                            corporate governance
  discussion for realizing the companys future vision and maintaining the stable
  supply of electricity
  in the electric power industry which is facing ongoing and significant changes in its business environment such as the full liberalization of
  the retail market the separation of power transmissiondistribution arms and a decline in power demand due to a low birthrate and an
  aging population chubu electric power is aggressively expanding its business into the greater tokyo area and overseas markets which i
  find commendable i would like to support the company s efforts in my capacity as an outside director leveraging my experience in
  conducting business in the fiercely competitive market
       the company is seriously committed to developing an effective internal control system and fulfilling its social responsibilities
  regarding its attitude toward the board i find the company gives due consideration for instance i can have meeting documents
  explained to me prior to a board meeting to enable the company to use the experience and knowledge of outside directors even more
  effectively i hope that when appropriate more explanation will be provided in advance regarding certain agenda items such as the
  background and process of discussion
       from my experience i can say that in a fully deregulated and competitive market you cannot win a contract
  with a customer unless you can demonstrate a competitive strength which in the eyes of the customer is better
  than that of any other competitor in the industry when your business format is continuously evolving in response
  to the changing business environment satisfaction with the status quo is not an option and ongoing improvement
  is indispensable you will also need to establish objective performance indicators specific quantitative targets and
  other appropriate criteria
       ensuring the stable supply of electricity of which chubu electric power has long been serving as a
  steward in the region is a significantly important societal mission the company should continue fulfilling
  this mission at the same time the company should also design and present what it aims to be in a future
  competitive environment to successfully adapt to upcoming major changes chubu electric power

reduction of co2 emissions in the area of logistics
chubu electric power is actively introducing lng carriers
with high fuel efficiency seishumaru and esshumaru
which were completed in september and december 2014
respectively are equipped with a peapodshaped shell
covering spherical tank which is integral to the hull this
unique style makes the ships lighter and more
aerodynamic and along with the high thermal efficiency
engine helps to improve fuel efficiency this results in
about a 25 reduction in co 2 emissions per unit load
compared to existing ships

     dont know what to do to to address compliance issues compliance may sound like something difficult and some
     employees may feel unfamiliar with the secretariat this is why we are working hard to become a place that

2 nuclear power backend costs etc                             global society the group has recognized growing
the backend business of nuclear power takes an extremely          importance to contribute to the achievement of low
long time period and has many uncertainties to prepare            carbon society through taking measures actively toward
for the future backend costs based on the rules set by the        reduction of co2 emission in electric power business
government chubu electric has set aside provision for                 based on above recognition the group has established
reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel and provision for          the chubu electric power group basic environmental
preparation of the reprocessing of irradiated nuclear fuel        policy  under its detailed protocol designated as action
    even so the costs of nuclear fuel cycles including           plan  the group is working systematically to use resources
backend costs may vary depending on regulatory reform           efficiently and reduce the burden on the environment
changes in estimates of future expenses mandated and              however the group s performance could potentially be
voluntary and the operating status of reprocessing               affected by the future trend of tightening environmental
facilities as a result company performance may potentially       regulations among other factors
be affected
