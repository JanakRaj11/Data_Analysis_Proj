                                as the importance of nonfinancial risk continues to grow across the financial sector
                                financial institutions increasingly focus on protecting themselves against the risks
                                 associated with the misconduct of individual employees and with ineffective processes
                                inherently this means fostering a strong risk culture across the organization

                                launched in 2010 deutsche banks dedicated risk culture initiatives program
                                 emphasizes that a strong risk culture depends as much on robust processes and

                                employees adherence to behaviors policies procedures and control processes

                                for example red flags are assigned for

                                 breaches against the gifts  entertainment policy

                                client centricity is one of our core values and is central to our strategy 2015 we
                                recognize that satisfied loyal clients are vital for our continued success this requires
                                 a culture based on client needs rather than an approach that focuses on products
                                 or transactions deutsche banks leadership launched a major initiative in 2014 to put
                                this clientcentric culture into practice

                                we need to improve our understanding of clients and gauge their needs better
                                 in the rapidly changing business environment putting clients first means analyzing
                                who our clients are what they want how well we currently meet their needs and
                                how we can add value for them in the future only then will we be fully able to help

                                 evolving consumer behavior and climate change

                                two concepts are central to this commitment which we are embedding across

                                in 2014 the credit risk management team raised concerns about the reputational risk
                                from continuing to do business with a hedge fund client that was facing legal action
                                the client represented a lucrative source of revenue but the team was concerned about
                                the potential longterm implications for deutsche bank the issue was e      scalated
                                to the regional reputational risk committee it was then reviewed by the group
                                reputational risk committee which judged that while the issue was not clearcut
                                 maintaining the relationship would be inconsistent with deutsche banks values and
                                 beliefs as a result deutsche bank ended its relationship with the client even though
                                 competitors continued to do business with the client



                                we evaluate the tax considerations of products with regard to the intent and spirit

                                a new initiative launched in 2014 will help us to develop clientoriented strategies
                                 and offer a full suite of effective products and services across the business divisions
                                we are introducing a common approach to client segmentation analysis and
                                measurement of satisfaction with a more systematic approach to gathering feedback
