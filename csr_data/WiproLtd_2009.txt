                                symbiosis for sustainability  we are together
                                symbiosis is about close and long term interactions between different species
                                this relationship is such that it provides real benefit to both species
                                symbiosis is the cornerstone of survival and sustainability for both the species
                                as we understand nature more we are realizing that symbiosis is equally important for
                                the evolution of species
                                as a motif for our first sustainability report therefore symbiosis is resonant
                                resonant with what we think sustainability is and must mean for corporations
                                resonant with the deep beautiful complexity of nature and of the human mind
                                resonant with eminently practical purposes with the here and now and with
                                evolution to tomorrow




                                                 we prefer to stay with this clear use of the word symbiosis there are other interpretations and usages of symbiosis but in our understanding
                                                 we equate symbiosis with mutualism  please refer the visual in the next page

        competition

level one neutralism                                       a
                                                            a good sustainability report should reflect mutualism between
                                                            a corporation and the society that it is a part of
neither species is harmed no conflict but no              it is this spirit of mutualism that is embedded in wipros commitment to
benefits either                                            sustainability our commitment is based on a bedrock of values and
                                                            thoughtful responsible actions towards it stakeholders

level two competition                                      our report is a living document that tries to reflect our commitment
                                                            our aspirations and our vision for sustainability we have seen this report
neither species truly benefits conflict over resources    as much more than a report it has been a ninemonthlong deliberate
                                                            exercise of reinforcing sustainability in every aspect of the organization
no interaction
                                                            it has been another key step in continuous organizational development

level three parasitism
one species benefits while the other is harmed
species have begun to engage with others in ways
beyond conflict but the benefits are balanced by losses
on the other side

level four commensalism
one species benefits the other is unharmed species have
found a way to interact without causing harm but the
benefits are still onesided

level five mutualism
both species benefit this is where the most complex
and stable relationships are found in nature




                                                                                                                                          3

m         any biologists consider coral reefs to be more diverse and productive than
          their land equivalents the rainforests corals are the only animals other
          than humans that are capable of building structures that can be seen by
space the great barrier reef for instance is constructed from small coral polyps
that together form a nearly 2000 mile long barrier reef

 dear fellow stakeholders

 why this report                                                                     everything we have tried to do this with sincerity and always with the
 ecological sustainability is easiest captured in the thought our current            knowledge that we can improve on this dimension as on everything else
 needs should be met without impairing the means for the future
                                                                                      its at our core  acting with sensitivity by being thoughtful and
 generations to satisfy their needs social sustainability reflects a society

 where there is dignity for every individual
                                                                                      wipro our values

 while there is surely a higher ethical and moral imperative for ecological           wipro  in conducting business with fairness and integrity in corporate
 and social sustainability even a very basic understating compels us for             governance and transparency and in operating practices

 the idea of triple bottomline ie focusing on people planet and profit         because of this belief from the decades old focus on eg conserving

 businesses focusing solely on profits reduce their chance of long term survival by
 ignoring the ecological and social costs this is the popular view while agreeing   as much as our operating practices have evolved our thinking and
 with this we also believe that addressing ecological and social challenges          consciousness have also evolved over the whole notion of responsibility

not all of these investments may be economically justifiable in the                                    table 1 mutual impact of wipro and its stakeholders
shortterm this illustrates a classic tradeoff situation where the
ecological benefit for the organization and society is assured over     stakeholder           brief description of mutual impact

on where to train management attention and organization                    suppliers         source of business revenues and profits but is also a marquee customer with high referenceability in their
resources eg ecological issues of high interest to stakeholders but                        marketing efforts
involving economic tradeoff merit serious attention from the
organizations leadership                                                 current and       wipros actions on ecological sustainability have an indirect impact on the surrounding communities

3     wipros perspective and strategy
    an organizations economic sustainability is strongly dependent on larger forces that determine the direction in which
    human society moves as a whole these forces could be ecological social or a blend of all three fig 4 illustrates this idea

    sustainability because the problems of economic
    ecological and social sustainability are
    so intertwined that it is difficult
    to separate the three
    a classic illustration of this
    is the reality where our
    civilizations so called
    societal advancement is
    itself the cause of
    ecological damage




       economic sustainability of an organization is related to the

       progress becomes unsustainable if it compromises ecology

                                                 opportunities
we begin with the caveat that table 5 above lists only the major ecological risks known to humanity the risks that are
                                                                                                                                        we believe that both emerging as well as established ecological risks
unknown now or that may emerge in future may be of even greater severity we believe that the complex feedback loops
                                                                                                                                        will give rise to a range of new opportunities three mega trends will
and interdependencies that exist in nature make it impossible to predict or even identify all possible ecological risks the best       drive the opening up of such opportunities
possible preparation for unknown risks is for us to continue to be open and engage deeply with all dimensions of ecology

         the carbon neutral conundrum
         we believe that the definition of carbon neutral is far more complex than the
         conventional understanding of reducing to zero the greenhouse gas ghg emissions
         of a company the carbon footprint of a product or service is not only on account of
         ghg emissions from a companys internal operations but is also a cumulated aggregate
         of the emissions up and down the supply chain for example the supply chain for the
         petroleum sector starts with extraction and ends with plastic typically supplychain
         emissions do not enter into the computation of a companys ghg footprint
         neither does the emissions associated with disposal of the product at the end of its life

         the fact that a company can claim carbon neutral status by purchasing carbon credits or
         by largescale offsetting measures such as afforestation complicates matters further
         typical tree planting drives often overlook biodiversity in the process the fragile
         sustenance of local communities may become seriously endangered

         given all the factors above and there may be more we believe that there is misplaced
         importance on the carbon neutral goal to the relative sidelining of equally and more
         important ecological goals the right approach is to not look at the carbon neutral question
         in isolation but to calibrate goals around it in congruence with other ecological targets




     
      qualifying note on the ecological goals in table 7 we are currently in the middle of a comprehensive internal
     exercise to baseline our ecological footprint in ghg water and waste we expect the exercise to provide us with
     clear insights into the milestones that we should set for ourselves towards the eventual goals of becoming carbon
     neutral and water positive the exercise is expected to be completed by march 2009 we will be able to report on
     the timelines associated with our carbon and water goals with much greater clarity in our next sustainability report
     for 200809

5 wipro and its stakeholders
 an organizations economic sustainability is strongly dependent on larger forces that determine the direction in which
 human society moves as a whole these forces could be ecological social or a blend of the two the mobius in fig 4
 illustrates this idea

 5a stakeholder identification 
 engagement framework
 ii
  n identifying the stakeholders for this report we considered two
 primary factors

 i materiality analysis what groups can affect or are affected by our
 actions what group can help define value propositions for our
 organization

 ii interaction intensity
 direct interaction
  which stakeholders do we interact with regularly

 indirect interaction
  which stakeholders do we affect by our actions but do not engage
   with directly

 we considered 10 possible stakeholders and mapped them against the
 same list of issues that were considered for materiality analysis in
 addition we considered the intensity of interaction for each of the
 stakeholders table 11 below illustrates the methodology used for
 stakeholder mapping
