review by the president group executive
chairman
in 2016 op continued its good financial performance by recording alltimehigh earnings before
tax as business grew at a rate above the market average our huge transformation process that we
started remains however uppermost in my mind when it comes to the bygone year why should a
successful company reinvent itself

in early 2016 we completed one of ops most extensive
operating environment analysis ever carried out its message
cannot be ignored the financial sector is faced with the most
drastic change in its history
we will respond to the change through our strategy adopted
in summer 2016 we want to lead it at the forefront and
reinvent ourselves with customer experience being our
priority
as a company owned by customers we want to be a trusted
partner in the daily lives of our customers we are branching
out into businesses where we have had some presence
previously through financial products such as mobility
housing and health and wellbeing
a journey towards diversification is a long and multistage
process which does not happen overnight as it should not
either traditional banking and insurance services will remain
our business cornerstone well into the future
op will reinvent itself led by customer interests in a way that
takes both the present and future customer generations into
consideration

investments
