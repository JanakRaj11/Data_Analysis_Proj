  networks
  over the past five years optus has invested
  more than aud2 billion to expand and
  improve the coverage it offers customers
  in 2010 we increased the number of base
  stations on our 3g network by more than
  15 per cent to both expand geographic
  coverage and to increase capacity to match
  the growth in data traffic

  we are often the first telecommunications
  carrier to provide coverage in newly
  developed areas the 3g dual band network
  covers up to 97 per cent of the australian
  population

  on fixed networks the major challenge
  for australia is to ensure the new national
  broadband network supports full
  competition among telecommunication
  providers rather than creates or
  perpetuates a monopoly

  integration
  integration is based on the idea that
  customers should be able to look at a piece
  of content change and store it on one
  device say a smartphone then be able to
  look at the changed content on their pc
  tablet laptop or television without having
  to physically move it there in other words
  a change in one device will automatically be
  replicated in all the others

  optus has built a platform called
  nscreens to support this integration and
  is rolling it out across australia

  customer service and billing
  the last element of the customer
  experience is the one that attracts most of
  the media coverage  customer billing and
  complaint handling

  the total number of complaints about
  telecommunications services continues to
  be a concern one of the big drivers for the
  increase in complaints is unexpectedly high
  bills for smartphone usage

  at optus we have invested time and money
  to bring the rate of complaints down we

   spent over aud250 million upgrading
    our it systems to help us better
    understand our customers and their
    needs and provide them with high level
    online functionality
   commissioned detailed customer
    research to identify what people like             optus yes shops providing customers with the latest devices
