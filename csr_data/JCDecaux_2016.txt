     a significant share of revenue

     on this basis the city voice study carried out in france in 2012

     software the sales teams can monitor in real time how the
     supply and demand for billboard networks is evolving and in this

     activities and the life cycle analyses lca of the furniture          and again in early 2016 to integrate the latest technological
     developed by jcdecaux managed by the sustainable                      developments tested and validated by the research and
     development and quality department and the research and                development department these changes helped decrease the
     development department have led to the identification of the          installed capacity in new furniture and in particular in 4tube cips
     main environmental impacts of the company                             whose installed capacity decreased by 49

     the groups greenhouse gas emissions are due to the energy             the use of led technology for lighting structures offers
     consumption by order of importance of furniture vehicles and        energy savings of over 50 compared to the consumption of
     buildings the groups other significant environmental impacts         ferromagnetic tubes coupled with a power modulation system
     are waste and water consumption due to its operations                 led technology allows for a greater increase in energy savings

     because these impacts were identified as important in the
     materiality matrix two environmental priorities were established                  lca focus
     as part of the sustainable development strategy

                                                                             therefore this is a multistage analysis

                                                                             the interest in this approach is to have a comprehensive
     the groups main environmental impact and the source of its            view backed up with figures of the products impact during
     greenhouse gas emissions is the energy consumption of its              the different phases of its life taking several criteria into

     our social commitment


     in 2015 the average length of service within the group was 93 years and ranged from 52 to 127 years depending on regions france
     the groups country of origin has the longest average length of service 127 years the differences in length of service are explained
     mainly by the more recent presence of the group in certain highgrowth geographic regions such as asiapacific where the average
     length of service is 52 years

the needs of its customers be it local governments transport companies landlords or advertisers to ensure longterm growth the
group must offer innovative highquality products and services along with help and support to its customers in their own sustainable

            focus on business ethics

                                          in a context of substantial internationalisation jcdecaux is confronted with a large number
                                          of ethical challenges the group has been committed for a long time to behaving ethically
                                          jcdecauxs anticorruption principles were formalised in the code of ethics published for
                                          the first time in 2001 and updated in 2005 and 2009 in 2014 the code of ethics was
                                          republished to fit the operational issues that may be faced by the groups employees and
                                          to integrate the evolution of the legislation especially the uk bribery act in 2014 the code
                                          of ethics was complemented by the group internal procedure for appointment and

                                          jcdecaux is aware that the portion of its business located in countries considered
                                          sensitive from the corruption point of view is increasing both due to its organic growth and
                                          its external growth jcdecaux pays particular attention to potential corruption risks during

                   édition 2014           therefore a crucial and strategic issue for the group

                                         to head off the risk of corruption the group created a number of specific internal documents
                                         and procedures the 2014 edition of the groups code of ethics setting out all the rules
                                         and principles of ethical behaviour to follow in the conduct of business ensures the
                                         group works in a responsible and sustainable manner towards its employees customers
                                         suppliers local and regional communities and competitors all the themes addressed by
  the code are subject to internal audit and incorporated within the risk management process there is a practical guide in the
  companys internal version of this code to go with each rule and principle to help the employee understand it

  the groups internal procedure for appointment and management of advisers created in 2014 defines internally the measures
  to avoid corruption acts committed by them

  this code and the groups internal procedure for appointment and management of advisers were translated in 15 languages
  and are available for employees on the groups intranet a public version of the code is available in the sustainable development
  section of the groups website

  an alert procedure was set up and is managed by the groups ethics committee this committee is comprised of the chairman
  of the audit committee who is an independent member of the supervisory board the chairman of the compensation and
  nominating committee and the director of internal audit the committees task is to ensure the compliance with the fundamental
  ethical rules set out in the code of ethics crucial for the existence and development of the group

  that the code simply exists is not enough each employee must be provided with the means to act in compliance with the
  provisions of the ethical rules of the group in 2015 each of the 3900 employees identified as those whose functions can commit
  the group with public administrations customers and suppliers signed the code of ethics and the groups internal procedure for
  appointment and management of advisers

  this distribution and individual acceptance is complemented with specific training on the fight against corruption to be deployed
  in 2016 this training is part of our continuous effort to have our values fully understood by training new employees and maintaining
  those already in the company up to standard our ambition is to measure ourselves against the highest standards

foreign exchange risk

in 2015 net income generated in currencies other than the euro accounted for 71 of the groups consolidated net income

despite its presence in more than 75 countries the jcdecaux group is relatively immune to currency fluctuations in terms of cash flows
as the subsidiaries in each country do business solely in their own country and intercompany services and purchases are relatively
insignificant

however as the presentation currency of the group is the euro the groups consolidated financial statements are affected by the
conversion of financial statements denominated in local currencies into euros

           in compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your annual general meeting we hereby report to you for the year
           ended december 31 2015 on

            the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of jcdecaux sa

            the justification of our assessments

           these consolidated financial statements have been approved by the executive board our role is to express an opinion
           on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit




      1 opinion on the consolidated financial statements
      we conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in france those standards require that we plan and
      perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement
      an audit involves performing procedures using sampling techniques or other methods of selection to obtain audit evidence about the
      amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements an audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
      policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial
      statements we believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion

      in our opinion the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of
      the group as at december 31 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with international financial
      reporting standards as adopted by the european union



      2 justification of our assessments
      in accordance with the requirements of article l 8239 of the french commercial code code de commerce relating to the justification
      of our assessments we bring to your attention the following matters

       	items of property plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill and investments accounted for under the equity method
         are subject to impairment tests based on the prospects of future profitability according to the method described in notes

         to the consolidated financial statements which results are described in notes 43 goodwill property plant and equipment ppe
         and intangible assets impairment tests and 44 investments under the equity method and impairment tests to the consolidated
         financial statements we have assessed the appropriateness of the methodology applied and of the data and assumptions used by
         your group to perform these valuations on these bases we carried out the assessment of the reasonableness of these estimates

       	note 119 commitments to purchase noncontrolling interests to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting
         treatment of purchase commitments for noncontrolling interests which is not specifically described in ifrs as adopted
         by the european union we have assessed that this note gives the relevant information as to the method applied by your group

      these assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and therefore contributed
      to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report
