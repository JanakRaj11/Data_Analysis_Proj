continuing to adapt to change doing more to better the health of people worldwide

the otsuka group listed its stock publicly in december 2010 and since then we have embarked on the challenges
that come with placing ourselves in an entirely new environment having reached the threeyear mark as a public
company in 2014 we recognize the need to continue to grow as a corporate group by adapting as we focus on
moving to the next stage
  now that we are a publiclisted company a larger group of people across the globe is familiar with the otsuka
group businesses history and philosophy at the same time this means there are a larger number of stakeholders
who expect more from our group in order to prove ourselves worthy of this trust and to garner a broader and deeper
understanding of our stance across the globe i believe it is incumbent on us to realize the original and unique ideas

of otsuka as a total healthcare company working to maintain and better health around the world




fulfilling worldwide expectations with global development that works for local communities

the otsuka group currently comprises 166 companies as well as 181 factories and 44 laboratories operating in
japan and 26 other countries and regions of these threefourths of our companies twothirds of our factories and
40 of our laboratories operate outside japan sales from international markets are larger in scale than those from
the japanese market in fact 568 of the total 145 trillion yen in consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended
march 2014 are from markets outside japan
  twenty different languages are used throughout the countries and regions in which the otsuka group currently
does business language systems express a distinct view of the world and it is through language that cultures
traditions and philosophies are conveyed accommodating all of these different ways of thinking we respect the
different cultures and characters represented by these languages and work to promote business activities that share
the basic otsuka group concepts and philosophy while integrating these differences harmoniously in the otsuka
group culture value does not lie simply with gaining knowledge value comes with putting this knowledge into
practice pursuing achievement to its conclusion to arrive at the essence of the matter and constantly pursuing new
challenges to create products and services that only otsuka can provide we are dedicated to bettering the health of
people around the world remaining vigilantly aware of the importance of creativity and proof through execution while
working in harmony with the local community




otsuka csr shaped by expanding stakeholder cycle

the business activities of the otsuka group only come together when there
are customers who use the goods and services that we supply the con
struction of a factory as well requires cooperation from a large number of
individuals including the understanding of everyone in the local community
the suppliers who provide the raw materials and the construction compa
nies and in return for the opportunity to conduct these business compa
nies we deliver to the community and our customers the products services
and information that we believe will help people lead happy healthy lives
  this concept of the positive stakeholder cycle is not limited to our busi
ness activities inspired by and committed to our corporate philosophy
it is our communication with stakeholders that shapes the activities that
comprise the otsuka group csr this relationship creates any number of
cycles as well our environmental activities for example recognize and protect the blessings that come from natural
capital while our social contribution activities are a channel through which we take part in enhancing and developing
local communities concurrently these activities are reflected directly and indirectly in the manufacture of goods and
the improvement of services which in turn contributes to the development of business the otsuka group focuses on
csr activities that are an integral part of business by creating trustbased cycles in which business generates profits
that are then returned to society which creates an affinity between the otsuka group and the community which in
turn generates profit that will be returned to the community
