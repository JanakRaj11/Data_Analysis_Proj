measurable this policy entitled growing responsibly together has three pillars our suppliers our
company and our customers our sustainability officer is responsible for coordinating our csr policy
we have also appointed a sustainability officer dairy who leads our comprehensive milk sustainability
programme responsibility for our sustainability goals more than 30 in 2016 lies with the members
of the management team mt progress is discussed on a quarterly basis with the mt and the board
furthermore the csr policy is reviewed and enhanced at least once a year during a meeting with
the board and the mt partly on the basis of the results of interviews with stakeholders

external audit of sustainability
performance
besides stakeholders we also have independent parties assess our sustainability performance
 csr management every year lloyds checks whether our csr management system is effective
  and how far ahead we are in terms of sustainability this twoday inspection will replace our csr
  performance ladder certification as of 2016 with this inspection we are introducing a tailored
  inspection which will prevent the following auditschecks being duplicated
 working conditions the environment and business practices in 2016 sgs will conduct a 4pillar
  smeta audit for our production sites in gorinchem and scharsterbrug smeta is based on existing
  standards such as the internationally recognised eti code of conduct
 food safety our production sites are certified by lloyds according to internationally recognised food
  safety standards fssc22000 in scharsterbrug and barneveld and iso22000 in gorinchem
 transparency regarding csr the dutch government ranks the transparency of companies social
  reporting by means of the transparency benchmark in the latest ranking concerning 2014 we were

                            best of milk
we aim to nourish the growing world population with tasty and nutritious milk powders our
mission is to bring the best of milk the dairy market is growing around the world and we are
growing along with it in a responsible manner it is our firm belief that a healthy business and a
healthy world can only be maintained through corporate social responsibility together with our
employees and supply chain partners that growth was clearly visible in 2015 with the opening
of our energyefficient factory in gorinchem we will increase our capacity we received more
milk from our dairy farmers and produced 7 more milk powder our workforce grew too
and finally we will open our new sustainable headquarters in early 2016

challenging dairy market                                  by means of a prize contest workshops and
the high milk production  caused among other            calling attention to csr in our communications
things by the milk quota being abolished  and           two trainees started studies one into the reuse
reduced demand led to a fall in milk prices for our       of our tins and the other into enriching our
dairy farmers in 2015 however we expect milk            products with vitamins and minerals for africa
prices will eventually go up again because of the        and finally the first water well was drilled for
growing world populations increasing demand              our litre for a litre project with this project we

                         it is important that we produce healthy milk
                         powders not only today but in the future for
                         next generations as well we therefore reward
                         our dairy farmers who take a revolutionary
                         approach to sustainable milk production

82 of our dairy farmers
participated in our
sustainability programme
the dutch dairy association and lto netherlands have set ambitious targets within the
sustainable dairy chain for 2020 wwwduurzamezuivelketennl vreugdenhil has translated
those goals into a sustainability programme in which our 891 dutch dairy farmers will be
financially rewarded for efforts that surpass statutory requirements in this programme we also
invest through workshops and tools in awareness and the transfer of knowledge to qualify for
a financial reward farmers must achieve at least half the total number of programme points

grazing premium                                            its goals as regards to climateneutral growth
every extra effort is recognised by means of               ammonia and phosphate production these
a financial reward of up to 100 per 100 kg               goals are important for the protection of nature

to participate in the cow compass programme                regulations around phosphate production
in 2015 cow compass is an instrument with                 which is a leading aspect in our policy
which veterinarians map the welfare and health
of the animals and advise on improvement steps


                                                               86
furthermore 86 of dairy farmers practise                                    of our dairy farmers
some kind of outdoor grazing this percentage
is higher than the dutch average of 78 but
                                                                              practise outdoor grazing
unfortunately lower than our result in 2014
consequently starting in 2016 we will pay out
a separate grazing premium to farmers that                 animal health and welfare as a key priority
practise full outdoor grazing we hope that this           dairy farmers have administered significantly
higher financial reward will stimulate dairy farmers       lower quantities of antibiotics in recent years
to continue practising grazing or even to change           antibiotics are now used exclusively for
to outdoor grazing rather than keeping cows                curative purposes and not as a preventative
indoors besides our sustainability programme we           measure in 2015 99 of our dairy farmers
also demand for instance that only responsibly           met the standard of the veterinary medicines

the fact that we have been adding 100 responsible
soy lecithin to our products since november 2015 is
something to be proud of the soy lecithin is certified
according to the proterra certification programme and
the soybeans are grown sustainably in brazil this means
for instance that people and nature are protected
through the safe use of plant protection products

our approach focuses
on more than milk
besides the milk we buy from our dairy farmers we also scrutinise our other purchases we
discuss csr initiatives with suppliers both ours and theirs and ask them to sign our supplier
code of conduct containing human rights and environmental requirements in terms of volume
97 of our dairy and ingredients suppliers and 99 of our packaging suppliers mainly tins
paper and plastic have already signed the code we then examine how we can improve the
sustainability of purchases that carry major environmental and social risks in 2015 a progress
document including improvement options was drawn up for centrally purchased goods and
services one improvement is to include sustainability in our supplier assessment system as
from 2016 csr is also included in the related audits approximately 20 per year

research into the environmental impact                     november 2015 we use proterra certified 100

in 2015 we achieved a slight reduction in our             soybeans are cultivated sustainably  in our
packaging material there are however limits             case in brazil sustainable cultivation protects

between us and our end users in 2015 we
started researching the environmental impact

highest sustainability requirements
applied to new buildings
our energy consumption per tonne of product increased in 2015 partly due to the
construction and commissioning of the new factory in gorinchem testing the factory lines
consumes a lot of energy but produces a low yield we expect that the energy consumption
per tonne will eventually drop thanks to the new factorys energy efficiency through its reuse
of heat and cold for instance the electric motors in the new tower are the most energy
efficient in their class and finally we use led lighting and motion sensors

since 2005 the production site in scharsterbrug           our goal as agreed in the sustainable dairy
has consumed over 30 less energy per tonne of            chain is to achieve 16 renewable energy
product in 2015 however energy consumption             by 2020 the remaining 89 of our energy
increased mainly due to the commissioning of             consumption is gas much of which we use
the third evaporator and the related tests for            to evaporate water from milk however green
the new operating procedure we successfully              gas is scarce in 2016 we will start offsetting
completed this process at the end of 2015 all            the co2 emissions from our gas consumption
in all we consumed 16 less energy per tonne             by buying co2 credits in developing countries

of water to severely water stressed african countries where our milk powders are sold in
