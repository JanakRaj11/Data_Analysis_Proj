preventing noises and odors

sk chemicals ensures that all its plants meet the noise and odor control standards set by legislations
sk chemicals also hires consulting firms to share the information of its compliance with regulatory
laws with the municipal authorities and citizens of the local communities the efforts of sk chemicals
include the recent installation of noisepreventing and deodorizing facilities at the osan plant to
completely block any noises or odors that may be generated by the freezer containers and research labs
from reaching the locals in this process sk chemicals conducted tests to determine whether the noise
and odor levels along the boundaries of the plant site exceed the legal maximum based on the test
results the plant installed noise silencers noiseproof rooms and an active carbon absorption tower
with a processing capacity of 80am3minute
