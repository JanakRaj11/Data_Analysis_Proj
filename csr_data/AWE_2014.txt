awe fosters a culture where no business objective
 will take priority over health and safety

our health and safety processes and reporting have been made more
rigorous by establishing health and safety committees in australia and
new zealand


commitment to safety
awe is committed to ensuring safety leadership and ownership at all levels of
the company this included senior executives conducting a number of site visits
and safety reviews at each of our operated sites further each member of the
board sustainability committee conducted a safety visit to the fpso umuroa
the support engagement and visibility of executive management with front
line staff has increased the intensity and focus on safety management
across the organisation the safety visits by senior executives also reinforced
expectations on safety values and behaviours in striving to attain an incident
free operation
awe captures information on leading safety indicators these indicators test
our controls and can be used to influence future behaviour and performance
leading indicators included operated and nonoperated site visits audits
and competency assessments
prior to the commencement of our drilling programs in western australia
and new zealand we needed to ensure that our safety systems were robust
bridging documents were in place and emergency response plans erp and
the crisis management plan cmp were tested individuals with erp and cmp
responsibilities were trained on how to respond in an emergency situation
during the year we continued to increase our focus on contractor safety
behaviour and performance in preparation for the mobilisation of the drill
rig for the perth basin drilling program in early 2014 a number of workshops
were conducted to ensure that risks were identified controls were in place
and safety recommendations were implemented accordingly we believe that
excellence in safety leads to sustainable operating and financial performance
we also recognise the important role that each employee and contractor plays
in achieving incident and injury free operations

at drover1 awe conducted rigorous contractor hse prequalification
assessments one critical element of this assessment was the review
of each contractors health and safety management system and their
overall hse performance the hsems assessment provided insight into
the contractors commitment structure and tools to ensure that all activities
were conducted in a safe and responsible manner we are pleased to report
that during the drover1 campaign we had a safe and incident free operation
there were no lost time injuries medical treatment injury or restricted work
cases and no reportable environmental incidents this excellent performance
can be attributed to the selection of contractors the effort and leadership that
was provided by numerous personnel to achieve this outcome and the vigilant

       awe is focused on minimising potential environmental
       impacts and conserving biodiversity through the
       implementation of leading practice environmental
       management systems even after operations have
       ceased in an area wherever awe explores and operates
       our goal is to leave a positive legacy by contributing to
       community development and environmental protection
       and rehabilitation our environmental management
       approach takes into account the diversity of locations
       and the variety of environmental risks in each location


       operating in the onshore perth basin
       western australia has some of the most diverse and unique
       flora and fauna boasting an abundance of wildflowers
       and native species awes approach to environmental
       management takes into account the diversity of locations
       and the associated variety of environmental risks across
       the perth basin
       the process for gaining environmental approvals from
       government departments and ongoing compliance has
       been integrated with the companys exploration appraisal
       development and operations activities a summary of the
       environmental plan for each well drilled is located on
       awes website wwwawexplorecom
       awe is aware of the high value placed on the mid west
       environment by landowners community members
       and other stakeholders and has undertaken rigorous
       environmental risk assessments testing and monitoring
       of waterways and sampling of soils particular attention
       is placed on protecting freshwater aquifers and sections
       of well bores that intersect aquifers are safeguarded by
       multiple layers of steel casing and cement
       in this reporting year awe undertook drilling of the drover1
       well which is located in close proximity to the lesueur
       national park 220km north of perth western australia
       the lesueur national park covers 26987 hectares and is
       home to over 900 plant species 10 of western australias
       known flora including acacia hibbertias leschenaultias and
       melaleucas it ranks as one of the three most important
       areas for flora conservation in southern western
       australia and its diversity is of international significance
       the department of mines and petroleum is the lead agency
       for the regulation of petroleum activities in wa however
       given the close proximity to the lesueur national park the
       development was also referred to the wa environmental
       protection agency
       managing potential risks to flora and fauna is paramount
       to awe key to the mitigation of any potential impact is
       staying within existing tracks and previously cleared areas
       minimising our project footprint was further achieved by
       adhering to strict hygiene requirements and ensuring
       equipment was cleaned and inspected for soil plant
       material and animal pests prior to mobilisation awe
       included a monitoring bore within the vicinity of the
       drover1 well pad to monitor the lesueur aquifer
       beneath the site

         environmental spills data reporting processes supporting the business activities
        conducting interviews and collation of evidence to understand the process and controls supporting the data
        reviewing incident reports on a sample basis to assess whether the classification of reported incidents were
         appropriately recorded
        undertaking analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data
        reviewing assumptions supporting the calculations of incidental emissions for reasonableness
        reviewing the sustainability report to assess the appropriateness of disclosure and
        checking that awe had made sufficient disclosures in the report to meet its selfassessed gri application level of c

       inherent limitations
       there are inherent limitations of any assurance engagement arising from the evidence on which the assurance practitioner
       draws conclusions upon being persuasive as it relies on selected data to be representative rather than conclusive there
       are additional inherent risks associated with assurance over nonfinancial information including reporting against
       standards which require information to be assured against source data compiled using definitions that are developed by
       the reporting entity


       use of report
       our responsibility in performing our limited assurance activities is to the management and directors of awe only and in
       accordance with the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with them we do not therefore accept or assume
       any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organisation any reliance any such third party may

       purposes described above

       110 code of ethics for professional accountants ernst  young has provided a range of services to awe including but not
       limited to the provision of certain statutory financial audit services we believe the provision of these services has not
       impaired our impartiality with respect to this work our team has the required competencies and experience for this
       assurance engagement

       matters relating to electronic presentation of the sustainability report
       our review was conducted on the awe sustainability report and other data that will be published on awes website we
       provide no assurance over changes to the content of awes report or other sustainability data after the date of this
       assurance statement


       assurance conclusions
       on the basis of our procedures for this limited assurance engagement nothing has come to our attention that causes us to
       believe that the subject matter as presented in awes sustainability report for the year ended 30 june 2014 was not
       presented fairly in all material respects and calculated in accordance with the criteria detailed above
