environmental communication system was announced how were                                          2005 because company s decided to ship the boxes to europe
these inhouse rules established                                                                    every gpcertified plant must submit a certificate of nonuse of
nakamura we had issues of bad communication on                                                       environmentally controlled substances analysis icp data and
environmental information between head office business units                                       the chemical ingredient list or msds at the time of product approval
and overseas sites and to solve this the system was established                                   screening in addition there are also upstream control obligations
aizawa manager hereinafter referred to as aizawa                                                  such as a confirmation form for change management to be submitted
when company p conducted an onsite audit of our chinese                                             when any change regarding production has occurred back then
manufacturing subsidiary suzhou shinetsu polymer co ltd sc                                    np was forced to change the material quality of a product supplied
in november 2004 the company was disqualified judged that its                                      in a small quantity because of its raw material supplier and at that
awareness about rohs substances was low this was however not                                      time it neglected part of its upstream management obligations for
reported to the electronic device business unit and when company                                    this reason in april 2006 judges from company s visited us and
p visited the kodama plant in september 2005 we came to learn                                       conducted a very strict reaudit to satisfy items pointed out during
of this fact for the first time and the negligence of environmental                                  the audit np reorganized its environmental quality assurance system
management was critically pointed out to us mr akazawa                                            but head office also received many requirements for improvement
president was very worried about this and gave instructions to build                                nakamura for the global environmental communication system
a mechanism to smoothly communicate information throughout                                           already established we added ①selection and appointment of
the group including overseas operations by the environmental                                         environmental administrators ②green procurement guidelines

nakamura that was the global environmental communication                                             in products etc and submitted it to company s as head office
system established in october 2005 this system was originally                                     management rules which was duly approved by the company
a mechanism for information communication but we had an                                             i heard that the rules contributed to restructure the business
epochmaking event that made this mechanism alive                                                   units mechanisms after receiving environmental audits from

customer supply chain
to meet the demands of csr management



shimazaki at shinano polymer co ltd we experienced                      same environmental category the contents of ems iso14001
the same issue during a customers environmental audit and                  and cms managements system of chemical substances
responded to it by specifying the prohibited substances in our              contained in products are actually different so i think it is not
own material purchase management guidelines in december                  reasonable to incorporate cms into iso audits
2008 however at the time of company ns environmental audit              arai at the kodama plant we conduct secondary supplier
they asked if the parent company explicitly indicated the prohibited        audits by providing environmental items in iso audits so we are
substances in documents to suppliers so we asked the head                  not much different from other plants by the way the csr dialog
office purchase center and legal group to revise the rules               of csr report 2009 says mr nakamura and i are certified as
nakamura in may 2008 the legal group prepared a revised                    company rs cms judges for this reason i have been learning
draft of the basic agreement of purchase transaction including            about the audits and think it best to conduct audits by using
an article requiring nonuse of prohibited substances as part               attachment 1 action item list and check sheet of jgpssi
of the review of corporatewide regulations but was left on the             guidelines for the management of chemical substances in
shelf in consideration of the reality of purchasing vinyl chloride         products many customers use this check sheet
for this reason we decided to complete a memorandum on                    kawamura i have asked the electronic device business unit to
environmental protection with material and parts suppliers for             conduct environmental audits of secondary suppliers in the china
electric and electronic products the prohibited substances                 sphere what is the progress of this
in this memorandum were disclosed as the shinetsu polymer                  aizawa sc conducted environmental audits of four secondary
groups control standards of chemical substances contained in              suppliers in fy2009 our business unit has six secondary
products and we maintain consistency with its contents                   suppliers in for example guangzhou dongguan tianjin and
aizawa as the corporate wide set of rules and regulations                   xuzhou and between fy2008 and 2009 we gave thorough
inhouse database doesnt include the global environmental                instructions about quality assurance systems we believe it is a
communication system that specifies this control standard                  challenge for fy2010 to firmly establish environmental quality
environmental staff of overseas plants and sites answer that we             assurance systems of these secondary suppliers
have no corporatewide standard against customers inquiries with           nakamura in the case of overseas sites we introduced the
simpleminded honesty what do you think about this                        environmental quality assurance system of sc and it was covered
kawamura the global environmental communication system                    in the sustainability report 2009 but shinetsu polymer malaysia
and control standards of chemical substances contained in                  sdn bhd issued its own environmentally hazardous substances
products are disclosed in our environmental and social report              guidelines established in october 2004 and conducts cms
and must be registered in the corporatewide collection of rules i         audits of secondary suppliers
will have this reviewed immediately                                        moderator mr kawamura please conclude the meeting
moderator what about the current situation of addressing the                kawamura i believe environmental administrators of business
challenge at the pvc products business unit                                units and plants have done a good job learning a lot from
ogasawara the recognition about pvc products in the electric                customers in relation to environmental audits please note however
and electronic industries is that they know vinyl chloride is an            that it is not desirable to have only the environmental administrators
excellent polymer but stabilizer plasticizer and other additives          be familiar with and operate the management of chemical
are problems it is therefore approved to use for applications              substances contained in products and for environmental staff at
without alternative materials and the tokyo plant has company              manufacturing and engineering to be unconcerned so i want you
ss gpcertification as a manufacturing plant of vinyl chloride             to conduct sufficient education and training of employees i also
compounds for vinyl chloride compounds we use about 1500                 heard that the environmental survey database of the electronic
raw materials and have more than 2500 products when we newly              device business unit is effective for information sharing so please
purchase raw materials etc we receive msdss for control based           develop the database across divisions at present requirements
on the tokyo plants material purchase control guidelines in the           from customers are more advanced
vinyl chloride compound industry leadbased stabilizer is used in the      such as supply chain information communication of jamp
field of construction materials leaving a possibility for contamination   control substances survey of candidate substances for reach
for this reason we conduct inspections of rohs substances before           approval contained in products and investigation of lifecycle co2
shipment using a fluorescent xray analysis of all items and many           emissions so please take appropriate actions and measures
electric wires we regularly hold environmental audits of oems              moderator we believe listening to ideas and comments about
secondary suppliers but in reality the main focus is on quality audit   supply chain green procurement management over the past ten
not so much on chemical substances contained in products                   years from environmental administrators from concerned divisions
kojima the same applies to the internal environmental audit and             has certainly been a precious opportunity for dialog thank you
environmental audit of secondary suppliers in fact though in the          very much

          1 expansion of the range of csr management
          we see a general tendency in csr management by companies
          in that they have expanded the range of management to entire                individual plants are located
          supply chains to enhance effectiveness toward the realization of a               on the negative side i must point out that energy
          sustainable society the awareness of this challenge in the shin           consumption and co2 emissions on the basic unit basis
          etsu polymer group is very high and in these two years dialog             increased for two consecutive years however this is due to the
          by inhouse parties concerned have been held and their detailed            decrease in production level due to the lehman shock and its
          account are described in the report especially in terms of the            mention in the report helps readers to understand this point
          response to the downstream supply chain i highly evaluated the             similar selfevaluation and careful descriptions are also found in
          fact that an organized methodology has been established and very            activity results by site suggesting the groups sincere attitude
          used consistently                                                          toward disclosure
               toward the future it is desirable to expand this initiative to the    3 expansion and improvement of social information
          upstream to develop it into csr management that can manage the              rich social information is another feature of this years
          entire supply chain also in order to strengthen the involvement           report compared with last years report quantitative data on
          of external stakeholders i think it is necessary to hold a dialog          employment was drastically expanded and improved making
          including outsiders                                                        the persuasiveness of descriptive explanations better however
          2 development in terms of the environment                                  in terms of actual initiatives there are some concerns about the
          the biggest progress made this year in terms of the environment             slight decreasing trend in the rate of paid holidays being taken
          is that a provision of protecting biodiversity was added to                 and insufficient improvement in the employment rate of impaired
          the environmental policy in the last report the overview of               persons whether they are temporary or need more improvement
          consideration and action toward biodiversity were introduced               should be reviewed for safetys sake
