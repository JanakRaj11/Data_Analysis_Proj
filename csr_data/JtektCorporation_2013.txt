  reducing co2 emissions in logistics
reduction of co2 through integrating product
delivery shipments
in fy2012 the co2 emission base unit was approximately 2
less than the previous year at 225 t100 million yen co2 emis
sions were slightly higher due to an increase in production
volume however through integrating product delivery ship
ments jtekt reduced annual co2 by 190 t we will continue to
reduce co2 in the future through further integration

world and there is an intensifying demand to increase efforts
such as the suppression of waste generation and reuse recycle         reduction of secondary material consumption
of parts etc                                                         we succeeded in reducing consumption by revising the material

responsibility as a manufacturer
at jtekt we consider the effective use of resources as one of         main measures
the responsibilities of an environmentally friendly manufacturer      reducing consumption through monitoring threading
through making improvements and devising ideas for the                 tap condition
production processes of each product we strive to reduce mate        the flange of the hub unit is threaded using a tap convention
rial usage and waste output reuse and save resources                 ally taps were disposed of after they had threaded 150 pieces
                                                                       however by monitoring the condition of the tap through spindle

      saving resources in production                                   according to its lifespan rather than the number of pieces it has
                                                                       processed reducing the number of taps consumed
reduction of primary material consumption
jtekt do our best to reduce material consumption through                  before improvement                             after improvement
changing product design and techniques and reducing stock

leftover material itself as well as many other improvements

csr activities and information including csr                new items which leave an impression are co2                             fication reports has been notable from around 3 or
released by companies can be likened to a never            emissions by scope and no of new people taking                        4 years ago and i am of the understanding that
ending journey in which for every step forward that is     time off work and reason by age regarding the                          reoccurrence prevention is being achieved so far at
taken the goal moves even further away in the past        former there are a notable number of items for which                    the companies who are taking such an approach
couple of years this trend has intensified and it is       the calculation method is under investigation and                       the fourth point is spreading csr internally this is
exactly as though one is trying to run up a descend        as such i look forward to future progress jtekts                      the first big hurdle that companies promoting csr
ing escalator as in if you stand still you will end up   mental health reporting has always been advanced                         come up against but once overcome csr will
relatively going backwards given this state of affairs    but this years report is more significant than that of                  advance significantly jtekt has been exerting effort
it is extremely reassuring to hear jtekts assertion        any other companys report up until 2012 unfortu                       into spreading csr internally since 2011 and their
that their csr and csr report consider the impor          nately at this stage mental health illnesses are not                   achievement is also apparent in the levelof
tance of observing and changing advancing year             on the road to improvement however i am confident                       understanding surveys moreover by reading their
after year                                                that through looking reality square on analyzing                       report i can see that csr has not only spread
i have 4 evaluation points and 1 request regarding          reporting and rolling out concrete measures the                         throughout jtekt but also jtekts group compa
this years report                                         situation will take a turn for the better                               nies i have expectations that moving forward
the first point is that the report was divided into 2       the third point is the report on action to reinforce                     jtekt will hold csr coordinating committee ses
versions pickup and details  data all companies         compliance regarding the 2010 price cartel for the                      sions with overseas group companies successfully
share a common wish to have their csr report read           sale of bearings in march of 2013 each company                         spread csr throughout them as well and incorpo
by more people and by creating two versions the            involved was dealt with by either being forced to pay                    rate messages and actions from overseas
way jtekt has this year i believe they can expect a        a penalty or being issued with a ceaseanddesist                        my request is the selection of important material
higher number of readers the issue is the separation       order jtekt was ordered to pay a penalty and not                        information and the disclosure of that process the
of information for the respective versions the gen        forced to ceaseanddesist however they were                            international trend guides companies not to feature
eral rule is to separate information with a firm aware     judged as having committed a violation although                         all information exhaustively but select which infor
ness that pickup should be a tool to promote com          my impression that last years report did not suffi                     mation to report on based on importance
munication with stakeholders while details  data          ciently cover this matter has not changed this years                   both the exposure draft of the international integrated

information has been selected based on keywords            to 2013 moreover during our conferral i heard that                    concept of importance while these two differ slightly
however as i will mention further in the importance        various measures were being strictly applied in                          they both seek explanations of how topics of impor
of information needs to be selected objectively            workplaces and jtekts firm resolve to prevent this                      tance were selected i understand that one of the key
the second point is the use of a new mark this           type of incident from reoccurring was apparent                          words of this report is importance however the
makes it plain to see that jtekts csr is advancing        important points from the perspective of reoccur                        selection process adopted is not objective
it is important that csr reports both respond to            rence prevention are awarenessraising strength                        from next fiscal year i would like jtekt to refer to
