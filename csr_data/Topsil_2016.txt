    scaling down resource consumption
    at production plant to be in tune
    with the needs
    the new topsil plant offers many options for smart control of resource consumption through the
    cts system cts central tilstandskontrol og styring  translates to central monitoring and
    management of conditions the very first efforts to exploit these options were concentrated
    around scaling consumption to follow capacity and those efforts were continued in 2015 this
    basically means reducing excess resource expenditure thereby saving money for the company
    as well as minimising impacts on the external environment with data continually collected
    by the cts and correct automatic settings a high degree of such fine tuning is possible



    elimination of excess cooling for                        power consumption for cooling has been reduced by
    primary production equipment                             at least 50 a quite significant reduction
    in terms of economy the main achievement has been
    to shut off cooling water for our primary production     as of yet control of the valves is performed by oper
    machines individually when they are not engaged in      ators but once the automatic valve control has been
    a production run this equipment called float zone      sufficiently tested the cts will completely take over
    pullers requires a substantial amount of cooling and    this operation completely to maximise savings and
    represents annual expenditure upwards of dkk             benefits
