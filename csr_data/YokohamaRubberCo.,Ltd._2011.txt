                             director as of june in 2011 since i have assumed such a
                             great responsibility i have determined my resolution which is
                             to duly take over the baton which represents our various

                             technologies will remain unchanged the greatest advantage
                             of the yokohama rubber group is first of all excellent vision
                             and planning compared to our competitors by initiating some
                             unique products such as being a trailblazer of the seller of
                             eco tires let alone our numerous technological strengths in
                             order to contribute to enrich peoples lives and greater
                             happiness it is my pleasure to continue to expand our
                             businesses by inheriting those strengths
                             meanwhile i must admit that there may be some aspects we
                             still need to work on such as letting our customers know
                             more widely as to the benefits of our existing products and
                             continue to explain them to all over the world from now
                             onwards in order to embark more on the globalization of our
                             businesses i strongly feel the necessity of our personnel to
                             equip themselves with sufficient communication skills so that
                             all the good things about our group will be known to the rest
                             of world even more
                             i was mainly engaging in the development of motor sport tires
                             since i joined the company as such i have experience of
                             extensive traveling to numerous countries to support various
                             racing tours among them it was so eyeopening for me to
                             get to know that people living in the rest of the world were
                             ever so diversified in terms of culture religion political
                             situation and their ways of thinking which are totally different
                             from we japanese now we are about to take a step on the
                             assumption that such difference is the absolute prerequisite
                             for every business so that we can get to understand each
                             other well i believe that this is the very attitude to be required
                             for our group even more in the future

                             iso26000 being the license towards
                             the global society
                             in november 2010 the iso26000 was established as the

every single one of our people aim for a higher standard

international standards for an organizations social                   actual sites during the great east japan earthquake in
responsibility i believe that by diligently following through this    march of this year i once again realized the importance of the
standard may mean the license of the future which is                  establishment of a work environment in place all the time
essential to obtain high credibility as a corporation in this          where each employee can think and act accordingly instead
global society based on such understandings we have                  of what a leader should do in case of emergency in other
reestablished the critical issues of yokohama rubber group            words one of the important aspects of risk management is
by reevaluating seven main core subjects such as human                that the employee is capable of making a decision when
rights labor practices and so on by reflecting them to our           heshe is under certain circumstances entailing a judgment on
companys case from now on with our critical issues as               hisher own which is probably not elaborated on the
pillars we are about to address those challenges in order to          operational manual
contribute to the formation of a sustainable society                  naturally another important issue is to continue to nurture our
for example as for the area of the environment considering           personnel who are capable to deal with various business
how to go about the electricity shortage expected this                 situations getting even more globalized day by day in the
summer we have set out a strategy for creation and                    light of the notion that people grow by putting themselves into
execution of energy savings by targeting 25 reduction of the          a new environment we are considering more of our personnel
consumption of electricity meanwhile shifting to an energy           would gain experience through relocation to our overseas
source with a lower environmental burden such as switching             offices by advancing the rotation timing of our employees
from heavy oil to natural gas those projects are progressing          transfer and so on
by advancing our existing midlongterm investment scheme              another aspect we focus on in terms of the utilization of our
of facilities tires which are our core products cannot be           diversified personnel is to employ disabled people we aim to
produced without oil this is the reason for our mission to aim        increase the ratio from 18 which is the current rate of the
for a manufacturing method with minimal raw material usage             employment of disable people hopefully to achieve 2 or
and the lowest energy consumption possible to achieve                 even more in the entire yokohama rubber group in order to
these i think there must be three steps to follow                    bring about this figure of course it is essential to establish a
improvement  to be created out of rich experience in our              workplace environment with absolutely no injuries or
existing operations innovation  to be achieved by setting a          accidents occurring but not just that it would also mean a
goal out of the box ie not merely an extension of                   comfortable workplace to be in even for the rest of the
conventional approaches and also revolution  to change our           employees with no disabilities and i strongly believe that
mind sets drastically                                                 establishing such a work environment will lead to not just to
furthermore in order to bring about those changes i also think       an efficient work operation but also a development of various
it is important that every single relevant employee has a good         new products by deploying the notion of the universal
awareness of the issues all the time and drive themselves              design
under constant pressure to persevere with these issues the
very breakthrough nurtured out of that will surely lead to the         in order to build a trusted identity as a contributing member of
solution of those critical issues in short the situation motivates   the global community yokohama rubber will as usual
our personnel and makes them become better people                    continue to make steady progress for various achievements
                                                                       stepbystep i would greatly appreciate if you could have a

is no point of evaluating the material other than right after extraction
