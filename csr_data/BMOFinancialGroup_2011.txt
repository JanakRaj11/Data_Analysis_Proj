record of sustainability in north america that predates canada itself    directly to positive outcomes for not only individual stakeholders
                                                                          but also society as a whole
two centuries ago we would have chosen different words to
describe the right way to do business however satisfying                these positive outcomes boil down to some strikingly simple
customers developing employees economic sustainability and              questions is it in the best interests of the customer is it socially
supporting communities were as much then as they are today                responsible does it create economic value and is it sustainable

                                                                          technology program at albertas lethbridge college we combine

 a note on branch closures
 outright closures of bmo retail branches are rare the closing of a particular location is typically one step in a branch relocation process
 necessitated by local market conditions changes in property lease arrangements or other factors on those occasions when we decide that it
 is necessary to close a branch we do so only after thoroughly considering the implications  for our customers employees shareholders and
 the local community  and ensuring that we are in compliance with all regulatory requirements
