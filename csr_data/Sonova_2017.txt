hearing care market and
supply chain




 hearing  an underestimated
 topic
 the importance of good hearing and the consequences of
 hearing loss continue to be underestimated even though
                                                                    who global estimates
 according to the world health organization who over 15 of
 the worlds adult population is affected by hearing loss the
 number of people with hearing loss continues to rise due both
 to the aging of populations in developed countries and to
 growing noise pollution in our environment in addition
 according to the un childrens fund unicef over 665000
 children are born with significant hearing loss each year


 people with untreated hearing loss are often faced with serious
 consequences these range from disadvantages at work to
 relationship problems and social isolation which may even
 lead to depression especially severe are the consequences for
 children with untreated hearing loss as the development of
 speech and language is fundamentally dependent on the sense
 of hearing untreated hearing loss also is often associated with
 academic underachievement which can lead to lower job
 performance and fewer employment opportunities later in life




                                                 3

in addition to the impact of hearing loss at an individual level
untreated hearing loss puts a heavy cost burden on society
todays hearing technologies offer the opportunity to reduce
this significantly




market opportunities
the hearing aid market continues to grow driven by longterm
socioeconomic forces the number of people on our planet will
continue to increase although populations in developing
countries are expected to grow the most even developed
countries with stable populations will face a growing proportion
of elderly citizens who are likely to experience hearing loss
these trends create commercial opportunities for sonova
through an increase in demand for hearing care


                                                                         15
                                                                        of the worlds
                                                                    population is affected
                                                                       by hearing loss




the overall rate of penetration for hearing technologies in
developed countries is around 20 we estimate that while in
developed markets 70 of people with severetoprofound
hearing loss have hearing aids only 10 of those with mildto
moderate hearing loss currently use hearing instruments
however younger and lessaffected people are increasing their
adoption of hearing aids as technology moves toward ever
better sound quality and smaller more discreet devices

around 80 of people with hearing loss live in developing
countries with low to medium income the hearing care market
in developing countries remains relatively underserved only
one in forty people with hearing loss wears a hearing aid
people in developing countries often have no access to
audiological and medical care



                                                  4

however we expect the growth of the middle classes in
emerging economies to boost consumption significantly and see
the shift in spending power and lifestyle ambition as a
substantial opportunity our strategy therefore calls for a strong
focus on the potential of emerging markets to serve the
demands of these newlyempowered consumers with suitable
product formats

the hearing care market is highly diverse requiring a broad
range of technologicallyadvanced solutions and extensive
                                                                         two
customer service channels the core of sonovas innovation
strategy is to maintain full development pipelines for products         thirds
and solutions by extending our innovative base technologies
across the different businesses and maintaining our rigorous           of our hearing aids
technology platform approach to product and solution                  sales are gernerated
development we accelerate timetomarket consistently              by products less than
generating around twothirds of our hearing instrument sales         two years from launch
from products launched within the previous two years




market challenges
even though we offer a product portfolio with a wide range of
performance and pricing levels affordable hearing care is still a
challenge for people in emerging countries and for
underprivileged social groups in developed regions




                                                  5

changes to governmental reimbursement and subsidy regimes
affect the amount of funding available to endusers and thus
the number of hearing aids sold this has a significant impact
regions with high reimbursement levels clearly show higher
market penetration the lower end of the market penetration
table mostly comprises emerging countries with no
reimbursement regimes

this challenge is aggravated by the fact that many countries
lack trained health personnel educational facilities and
necessary data to address the needs of those living with
hearing problems these factors and the lack of hearing care
professionals and infrastructure in certain markets can impede
efforts to raise the penetration rate as an example china
faces the challenge of the rapidlygrowing number of people
with hearing loss potentially exceeding the number of qualified
hearing care professionals to help them to tackle these
challenges we have defined a wide range of initiatives
including dedicated products for china cooperation with
distribution partners and government and education for
hearing care professionals read more about our commitment

the hear the world
foundation
around 665000 children with hearing loss are born every year
and 80 percent of them have no access to audiological or
medical care sometimes their families are unable to afford it
or maybe there are no suitable facilities nearby because they
live in crisishit parts of the world or the societies they live in
do not educate them about opportunities and consequences
the ramifications for their chances for the future can be
devastating as the development of speech and language is
fundamentally dependent on the sense of hearing untreated
hearing loss also is often associated social isolation less
chance of getting an education and poor prospects for future
employment

through the hear the world foundation founded in 2006 we
are working to counteract this and are committed to creating
                                                                       hear the world

employee wellbeing
sonova group companies and operation centers take specific
prevention and health promotion measures to help maintain
and enhance each employees capacity for productive and
fulfilling work in 2016 sonova launched its global body  mind
initiative to align and support its various current prevention
measures this health initiative rests on four main pillars

       sound and well balanced nutrition
       physical and mental harmony through exercise
       reenergizing through active relaxation
       medical care through regular checkups and vaccinations

our group companies are responsible for implementing body 
mind measures locally and for continuously refining programs in
                                                                                        body  mind at hq

occupational health and
safety
sonova has established an effective occupational health and
safety culture that supports and protects our employees we
regularly monitor and analyze the potential health and safety
risks of our operations and implement both legallyrequired and
voluntary occupational health and safety programs

sonovas operations have a relatively low exposure to health
and safety risk but we are committed to continuous
improvement here as elsewhere we therefore investigate each
incident to determine its cause and to take steps to prevent any
reoccurrence our low exposure to health and safety risk is
once again reflected in the figures for this financial year any
incident which requires external medical health care is
considered as a workrelated injury and is reported in the table
below in general such injuries and lost work days are not
caused by the manufacturing processes they are more likely to
be sustained during activities such as movement of goods the
injury rate ir which covers the sonova headquarters in stäfa
and the manufacturing sites in asia is at the very low level of
044

environment
we offer our employees a flexible and inclusive work
environment and an open culture




     environmentally friendly
     practices
     sonova makes an explicit commitment to continuously promote
     and pursue environmentally friendly practices throughout the
                                                                       environmental policy
     entire lifecycle of its products and across all its business
     activities we set the priorities and provide the resources
     needed to reduce our environmental impact through
     responsible efficient management of our buildings and
     infrastructure processes products and services the
     environmental policy supports sonovas commitment to behave
     proactively and describes the companys environmental
     performance management organization and responsibilities
     along with their relevant environmental aspects and other
     management approaches

     sonovas environmental program sets clearly defined targets of
     which the three most important are a 10 reduction from
                                                                       targets and

     intensity by 201819 a 10 reduction from 201314 levels of
     air travelrelated carbon emissions intensity by 201819 and
     ensuring that 100 of key suppliers are rated as having a
     qualified environmental management system in place by
     201819 we continuously monitor and optimize
     environmental objectives and performance across the group


                                                    40

as part of this continuous improvement in operations sonova
has committed to establish iso 14001certified environmental
management systems at all its key manufacturing and
distribution centers these require employees to make sound
environmental decisions when designing manufacturing and
servicing products for nonmanufacturing sites sonova has
implemented an adapted environmental management system
to ensure integration of environmental factors in decision
making and improvement in environmental performance the

we insist on environmentally friendly business practices
throughout our supply chain we do not restrict our
                                                                  931
environmental standards to our own operations but consider
them equally crucial in selecting our suppliers the sonova      key suppliers with
group supplier principles recommend that suppliers use the            qualified
international iso 14001 standard as the starting point and         environmental
basis for their work in 2016 931 of key suppliers were       management system
rated as having a qualified environmental management system
in place compliant with iso 14001 or other recognized
standards

thanks to sonovas low risk exposure to environmental issues
and its strict groupwide environmental management no fines
or nonmonetary sanctions were levied against sonova in 2016
or in previous years for noncompliance with environmental
laws or regulations

climate protection and energy
reduction
climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time it
requires prompt effective action from governments industries
and individuals sonova is committed to reducing the carbon
footprint attributable to its direct and indirect energy
consumption including energy used in transportation and
distribution the companys strategy requires a steady increase
in the energy efficiency of its operations integrating
environmentally friendly energy purchase and generation and
optimizing transportation and distribution logistics sonova has
set up implementation initiatives that concentrate on its most
energyintensive facilities while considering other sites that
show realistic potential for improvement from a risk
perspective sonovas business has a low exposure to climate
change and hence has no financial implications for the
organizations activities

in 2016 the total energy consumption of the sonova group
increased over the previous year by 123 to 39161
megawatthours mwh this was mostly due to the electricity
consumed in new buildings in china and vietnam along with
the acquisition of hansaton in germany in line with the
increased energy consumption at group level sonova groups
absolute carbon footprint grew by 106 to 24799 tonnes of
co2 equivalents t co2eq this increase stems from the scope
2 emissions and is largely explained by increased electricity
consumption due to a greater number of employees and
increased production volume at the operation centers in china
and vietnam a 5000 square meter solar panel system in
suzhou china which was put into operation in 2015 will help
us reduce our co2 footprint in upcoming years by substituting
solar power for coalderived electricity in 2016 the new
photovoltaic system produced 500000 kwh of green energy

as mentioned above sonova aims to achieve a 10 reduction
from 201314 levels of productionrelated carbon emissions
intensity by 201819 one example of how we are working to
achieve this goal comes from the advanced bionics operation
center in valencia usa were we replaced conventional
lightning with led technology to save energy both in the
building and in the parking area thanks to this measure the
operation centers electricity consumption dropped by 4
saving 240 mwh of energy per year despite our efforts to
improve energy efficiency in our infrastructure and production
processes the company recorded a higher co2eq emission
value per unit produced the increased production volume could
not offset the additional co2eq emission caused by our new
buildings in china and vietnam




                                              43

monitoring transportation and
distribution
sonova is a global company businessrelated air travel is
essential to maintain and improve operations and to
collaborate with internal and external stakeholders we
estimate however that we could reduce our carbon emissions
by at least 10 by systematically using information and
communications technology to substitute for air travel in
2016 the carbon emissions from businessrelated air travel
activities on a groupwide basis were 10307 t co2eq of which
33 originated from the flights of sonova employees in
switzerland despite strict travel policies and the increased use
of webconferencing tools carbon emissions from business
flights increased in absolute terms by 136 compared to the
previous year carbon emission intensity expressed as t
co2eq  million chf sales decreased by 107

sonova also estimated the carbon footprint of its corporate car
fleet in 2016 all vehicles purchased leased or rented by
sonova group companies were taken into account the
estimated total carbon footprint of sonovas corporate car fleet
is around 5049 tonnes per year the average carbon emissions
per single vehicle were evaluated at 139 grams co2km
sonova has therefore reached for the first time its long term
goal to achieve average carbon emissions of 140 grams
co2km or below

because the availability of public transport differs across
countries sonovas initiatives to promote environmentally
friendly commuting are influenced by the local infrastructure
the headquarters in stäfa established an integral mobility
program which provides incentives to use public transport
accompanied by targeted awareness campaigns this initiative
increased the proportion of employees who commute using
public transportation from 40 to 60 over the last 10 years




                                                44

in terms of product distribution air freight is clearly the
dominant contributor to sonovas carbon footprint accounting
for around 97 of relevant co2 emissions based on a study
conducted in 2014 the carbon emissions for the hearing
instruments segment are estimated at 7000 t co2eq in
absolute terms and 085 kg co2eq per tonnekilometer in
relative terms distribution from group companies to retail
shops was not taken into account the equivalent carbon
emissions for the cochlear implant segment were around 1100
t co2eq and 098 kg co2eq per tonnekilometer respectively
the data analyzed for the cochlear implant segment cover
around 80 of the total carbon footprint in t co2eq from
transporting and distributing products including distribution
from group companies to clinics




materials
as a medical device manufacturer the sonova group takes a
proactive approach to evaluating materials in its products and
components to assess environmental health or safety risks
sonova may restrict substances because of customer or legal
requirements or because the company believes it is
appropriate based on a precautionary approach evaluating
alternative materials is a continuous process relevant to all
stages of the production

the main materials used in sonova products are polymers eg
nylon silicone acrylonitrilebutadienestyrene acrylic
                                                                    rohs eu directive
polymers metals steel titanium tin and semimetals eg
silicon sonova complies with the eu directive on restriction of
hazardous substances rohs which governs the use of heavy
metals and halogenated compounds and with the eus                 reach eu directive
registration evaluation authorization and restriction of
chemicals reach regulation for the safe manufacture and use
of chemical substances sonovas suppliers are also required to
prove their compliance with rohs and reach regulations in
their respective processes and supply chains




                                                45

in accordance with reach regulation phonak continuously
updates the list of substances of very high concern svhc that
                                                                   phonak material
may be present in its products above the threshold level of
                                                                   declaration
01 by weight of the article this list is made publicly
available on the phonak website by the end of the 201617
financial year dehp was the only substance remaining on this
list

other substances classified as hazardous  but excluded from
the rohs directive  include solder paste and wire paint
organic solvents oil emulsions mineral oil and waterbased
cleaning solution employees who work with chemicals and
hazardous substances or come into contact with them are
regularly trained in their safe handling




waste
for sonova dealing with materials sustainably means avoiding
or reducing waste wherever possible collecting recyclables
separately and disposing of hazardous waste in
environmentally compatible ways thanks to various initiatives
in group companies such as doublesided printing by default
sonova was able to increase its recycling rate by 184 tonnes to
46 in the future sonova aims to further increase the
recycling rate to 50

in the volume of solid waste sent to disposal such as
municipal solid waste or material left over from manufacturing
processes there was a slight increase to 1142 tonnes

sonova complies with legal requirements to transport and
dispose of hazardous waste solely through officially authorized
disposal agents the main categories of hazardous waste
substances are solvents oil emulsions paints adhesives
soldering paste filters petroleum and washing fluids in line
with the increase in groupwide production volume in 2016 the
amount of hazardous waste rose slightly to 36 tonnes

reduce the use of hazardous substances avoid other
environmental risks minimize consumption of resources and
design for recycling and easy endoflife treatment

sonova has been advancing the industrial use of 3d printing
technology for many years at the beginning of the millennium
sonova was one of the very first companies to start digitally
producing custom shells for intheear hearing aids and
earpieces today the company prints hundreds of thousands
of custommade products every year in 201617 phonak
introduced the virto btitanium combining the strength and
lightness of titanium with the versatility of 3d printing to

even after careful supplier selection we maintain a continuous
supplier management process we annually assess supplier
csr risks and identify the risk level for each supplier we
manage our suppliers based on their risk level regularly risk
auditing supplier sites if a problem occurs we require the
suppliers to take preventive and corrective measures and
follow up on their progress until the issue is resolved

in the 201617 financial year we had 11 critical suppliers we
conducted two audits and a further three were certified or
recertified by a notified body the other critical suppliers were
visited once or more times in the year in a less formal manner
but with the group supplier principles always an important
topic no significant actual or potential negative impacts
related to environmental issues labor practices or human
rights matters occurred in sonovas supply chain

taxes

100 countries and owns local wholesale and retail distribution
subsidiaries in over 30 countries with this business structure
sonovas tax contribution encompasses various direct and
indirect corporate and employee taxes as well as customs
duties that make a significant contribution to societies around
the world sonovas tax approach is fully compliant with local
law and regulations as well as in complete alignment with
relevant international standards

sonovas approach to taxes is based on the following principles

a taxes follow the business sonova does not use offshores
structures nor does the group allocate functions or risks to
                                                                   oecd beps reports
international structures purely for tax reasons sonova avoids
the acquisition of nonbusiness related offshore structures an
important step during the integration process for newly
acquired companies is to unwind acquired tax schemes and
bring the tax structure of the new business fully in line with
sonovas tax policy and beps principles

b full compliance of all taxes with local laws regulations and
alignment with such internationally recognized standards as the
oecd guidelines sonovas complex crossborder operations
and supply chains are subject to yearly reviews using sonovas
transfer pricing documentation and multiple benchmarking
analysis intercompany transactions are regularly monitored to
ensure complete alignment with international standards and
sonovas internal transfer pricing policy




                                                67

the responsibility for tax compliance lies with the corporate
tax team located in switzerland and in the us the team
reports directly to the group cfo this function coordinates
educates and supports local controllers in all group companies
to ensure that they achieve tax compliance in line with
sonovas standards and policies a master transfer pricing file
is prepared along with local files that are coordinated with the
local organizations according to the oecd guidelines and
sonovas transfer pricing policy sonova has been fully
prepared since 2016 to implement external countrybycountry
reporting when this becomes mandatory for swiss multinational
enterprises

as part of our proactive tax compliance policy we continuously
engage in open and constructive dialogue with tax
administrations worldwide




bioethics
as a manufacturer of medical devices sonova is required by
regulatory authorities to demonstrate the biological safety of
any product with body contact by complying with the
international standard iso 1099312009

according to this standard animal tests need to be considered
in biological safety evaluations in some cases they cannot be
completely avoided however we are committed to the three
rs principle  replacement reduction and refinement  to
limit such testing as far as possible


replacement
    we use nonanimal testing methods in particular testing with
     cell cultures or chemical constituent testing in situations
     where these methods are accepted by the respective regulatory
     bodies and yield information as relevant as that obtained from
     in vivo models
    we monitor the development and regulatory acceptance of new
     in vitro methods




                                                 68

reduction
   we apply strategies to reduce the number of animals used in
    testing eg
   we use previously evaluated or historically established
    biologically safe materials whenever possible by taking
    advantage of shared research between the different sonova
    companies around the world we strive to avoid completely any
    unnecessary or duplicated testing
   we emphasize risk assessment to evaluate clearly any need for
    animal testing


refinement
   we select those test methods that cause the least distress to
    animals
                                                                     oecd principles of
   we conduct all animal testing through appropriately accredited   good laboratory
    testing laboratories all tests are conducted according to       practice
    recognized valid and current best laboratory and quality
    practices such as the oecd principles of good laboratory
    practice
