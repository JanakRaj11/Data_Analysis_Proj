    yellow card emergency response measures


drivers of shipping vehicles carry a yellow card 2 detailing emergency measures to be taken
to minimize damage in the event of an accident toray has also established an emergency
communication system and carries out emergency training in case of an accident during
transportation in the unlikely event of such an accident toray has procedures in place
enabling the necessary staff to be dispatched as swiftly as possible to the accident site for
assistance

    initiatives to prevent overloading


the overloading of trucks causes vibration noise damage to roads and facilities and also creates driving hazards
consequently toray is putting considerable effort into the prevention of overloading in order to fulfill its social
responsibilities in the transportation of goods



    compliance and security measures for importing and exporting

as a measure to ensure the legality and safety of imports and exports as part of toray groups expanding global
operations a us subsidiary of toray international inc enrolled in customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat                                 38
3 with the aim of strengthening global supply chain compliance in order to realize more efficient imports and exports of

materials and to strengthen supply chain compliance and security measures toray is also encouraging its worldwide
distribution partners to obtain authorized economic operator aeo 4 status


3a voluntary program introduced by united states customs and border protection in november 2004 the aim of the program is ensure and
  strengthen security through the global supply chain based on international cooperation with private operators importing goods into the us
4a status implemented by the eu in december 2006 that gives priority in customs procedures to importers and exporters with a high level of
  compliance for cargo security the japanese customs act was also revised in 2007 and a similar qualification system was established to provide
  priority in customs procedures to highly compliant operators


    promoting green logistics and more efficient distribution


  implementing a modal shift across business sites
in the past toray transported products and raw materials on land from its ehime plant to its nagoya plant by truck the
company later switched to coastal marine transport for a portion of the total volume transported averaging 400 tons per
month the remaining volume of products and materials were transported by truck by employing multiple means of
transport toray eliminated deliveryrelated problems while progressing toward a modal shift furthermore this initiative
led to a reduction of co 2 emissions totaling 218 tons about 30 less than transport using only trucks


note in relation to this initiative subsidies received from the japanese government covered the portion of transport expenses needed to implement the
  modal shift




         transport of resin chips between the ehime plant and nagoya plant was switched to coastal shipping routes




  promoting environmental logistics and more efficient distribution through group cooperation
in fiscal 2012 toray textiles inc began reducing the number of transport trips from its tokai plant by employing new
logistics equipment designed to improve the loading efficiency of trucks the company previously did not stack goods
during transport to prevent potential damage recently however it began employing a raised platform inside its trucks to
enable two tiers of loaded items thereby increasing the loading rate by about 50 from the perspective of safety the
company improved its logistics equipment and work procedures in consideration of avoiding loading in high places and
preventing products from falling
through these measures toray textiles reduced the number of delivery trips from the plant by half from april 2012 which
is equivalent to decreasing co 2 emissions by about 43 compared to previous levels




                             toray textiles improves loading efficiency by utilizing logistics equipment

                                                                                                                              39




    expanded collection and reuse of packaging materials


as an initiative to help protect the global environment and efficiently utilize resources toray has set up a nationwide
system in japan for recovering and reusing the packaging materials for products sent to customers all production plants in
japan participate in the system and toray is also promoting the reuse of packaging materials at its plants outside the
country as it expands business globally

masahiro yoshida sukagawa when we participate in torays basic distribution policy briefings we learn about the
                                                                                                                                                         subject index
serious efforts to improve distribution and quality by toray the owner of the goods being shipped and since the event
provides an opportunity for distribution companies to be evaluated it creates an atmosphere of friendly competition and a
chance to learn from and cooperate more with each other
after returning to our respective workplaces we ask ourselves what we should do as a member of one big team thinking
about these things comes naturally and if such ideas are eventually followed through we gain confidence that our work
can have an effect on the toray groups distribution capabilities



kenzo yoshida daisei i think of the award we received from toray
which commended us as an outstanding company in the same way i regard
a thank you letter given by a customer since the companys work was
appreciated employees feel proud and more motivated in their work
three years ago we set up a team called the toray task force at our
company to respond to torays expectations for us our company has
around 400 customers and each is handled through many departments
including the shipping department warehousing department operations
sections administration sales accounting general management and so
on nonetheless we created a team made up of managers in every area
related to our work for toray to improve quality in all of these areas first                 a toray task force meeting in process

of all the team was created as the center of activities numerical data was
checked thoroughly and all tasks that needed to be done were undertaken
these measures were the result of a vivid awareness inside the company of the importance of verifying data which i felt
was strongly emphasized at torays basic distribution policy briefings



question 2
toray began initiatives to improve distribution quality in 2006 the considerable amount of cooperation that
toray has received from its distribution partners in this regard has led to significant results for example the
number of problems involving distribution has fallen by about half each of your companies has implemented

unique activities to improve quality which of these immediately come to mind as original initiatives                         41
yoshida daisei our 8s inspections come to mind many companies in japan employ the 5s system which is based on
sorting arranging tidying cleaning and discipline but our company has added three additional itemssafety space and
smiles we have been using this system for over ten years members of our 8s inspection committee perform checks and
awards are given to departments that achieve excellent 8s results at a companywide meeting every month by creating
an evaluation system that everyone accepts we can share the same aspirations while fostering awareness in the
workplace


yoshida sukagawa for me it is our affirmation training it is said that
quality comes from the talent of your people but to raise quality in the
distribution business training human resources is essential when i
considered such training first of all i thought that greetings and replies
which are basic acts of a person should be thoroughly practiced therefore
this initiative always gives importance to the most basic of skills employees
practice exchanging names while shaking hands and responding with
clearly spoken affirmatives this training is conducted once per week
without fail
we have also established outstanding employee awards to provide
commendations for the awards ceremony we borrowed some ideas from               employees practice giving affirmations
the grammy awards and began unique company events like having award              while uniforms are inspected

nominees walk on a red carpet i wanted the ceremony to simply and
clearly express how much we value employees and the appreciation i have
for them as company president looking forward to fun events like this lifts peoples spirits while they work

question 3 looking toward the future could you tell us about your goals and ambitions as a company
president


yoshida sukagawa i have been president for three years now but i
would like to focus more on ongoing employee training based on the idea
that quality comes from the talent of your people i want to stick closely to
this approach so that it steadily spreads beyond the training room at
present information that should be shared and particular items that need
attention are posted and distributed in the workplace so that all employees
can see and be constantly reminded of them i want these ongoing
endeavors to lead to better capabilities in all employees and the continued
success of our company
when customers tell us that they are happy they trusted us with their
goods we know we have done our basic job as a distribution company
                                                                                  a typical bulletin reminds employees of
especially at the time of the great east japan earthquake people in our
                                                                                  a company motto manage by observation
business were told that residents of the tohoku region had sent their
heartfelt thanks and they felt proud of the work they do so while it is
normal for us to deliver things safely to the designated places appreciative words from customers are a source of simple
pleasure for us they are something we never forget 


yoshida daisei i have built on my experiences as an executive manager for many years but i am still in the process
of figuring things out there are things that need to be changed and things that should stay the same and i am constantly
trying to determine which is which studying and examining such issues is always the key to making sure decisions are
appropriate
moreover to prepare for the fast and increasingly complicated path followed by companies today requires more than just
corporate culture and traditions specifically it is necessary to incorporate external models and regulations such as iso
and environmental management certification to develop a company that meets the standards expected by the public what
i want our company to achieve and pursue is contributions to society this good for society is one of the socalled three
goods in traditional japanese business ethics along with the good for the customer and the good for the seller i hope
to always keep this principle in mind as we conduct not only the companys business but also its full scope of activities
going forward



thank you for sharing your insights today

    toray group safety record


toray has been compiling safety records since 1980 and toray group as a whole has done the same since 1990
information on occupational accidents is also shared groupwide including at subsidiaries and affiliates outside japan
in 2011 a total of 21 occupational accidents including both those resulting in lost work time and those with no lost work
time occurred in toray group the occupational accident frequency rate 1 was 024 accidents per million manhours
worked if accidents resulting in no lost work time are included and 016 if only accidents resulting in lost work time are
included these results are excellent in comparison to the overall average rate for manufacturing industries in japan of
around one accident per million manhours worked causing lost work time
looking forward toray group intends to continue implementing safety measures with the goal of achieving zero accidents
and to build even safer workplace environments

    3z activities for total safety


as part of its mediumterm management program that commenced in 2011 toray is working to improve the capabilities of
its workplace by expanding its powerup 3z activities which aim for zero accidents zero troubles and zero claims
under these activities zero accident measures are carried out under the strong leadership of production plant managers
with the goals of completely eliminating serious accidents and ensuring that the rate of accidents resulting in lost work
time does not exceed 005 per million manhours worked these measures are designed to raise the level of safety at
worksites by evaluating operations using videos and ensuring that working areas are regularly cleaned
in addition toray holds 3z briefings twice annually with the attendance of directors in charge of 3z activities mutual
safety inspections are also conducted between departments or companies and plants as an interorganizational measure
for making improvements across the entire toray group



    special initiatives for improving safety


after a string of accidents occurred in the first half of 2011 toray group formulated exhaustive measures to improve
safety focusing on accidents involving machinery with rotating parts sharpedged tools and forklifts which pose
particularly high risks to safety the group is working to improve overall safety through these measures in 2012



    ensuring each employee strictly follows basic safety procedures


toray group recognizes that most occupational accidents are the result of human error from this perspective in 2011 the
group had all relevant employees work with their supervisors to create basic safety rules for ensuring that safe operational
procedures are followed and initiated activities to promote strict adherence to these rules in 2012 toray group is
working intensively to design a safety code of conduct to encourage employees to think carefully about the safety of
operations before carrying them out



    implementing stringent safety activities that include the participation of subcontractors onsite


as it strives to eliminate occupational accidents toray group requests that
subcontractors at its worksites participate in groupwide safety activities such
as following the method of pointing and calling out procedures and taking
measures to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents that have occurred in
the workplace in this regard safety council meetings are held regularly for
onsite subcontractors to ensure that safety instructions are properly
understood



                                                                                    safety meeting held at torays nagoya plant




    carrying out activities to prevent recurrence of similar accidents


toray group is making the most of its safety measures and sharing relevant information groupwide in its efforts to
prevent previous accidents from happening again information is shared not only about all occupational accidents and near
accidents at toray group companies but also about major accidents at other companies in 2011 the group implemented
electricity saving measures while proactively compiling information on how to effectively prevent heat stroke and shared it
with all group companies and plants



    enhancing fire prevention initiatives


toray group positions fire prevention as one of its highest priorities along with safety measures every company and
plant in the group conducts voluntary fire prevention inspections and firefighting drills to pursue effective inspections
toray group employs a fire prevention checklist consisting of 906 items compiled on the basis of lessons the group has
learned from past accidents
in 2011 three fires broke out at toray group companies outside japan recognizing the seriousness of these incidents
the group undertook a fullscale review of the flammable substance management items in the fire prevention checklist
and also reviewed its fire prevention methods for duct systems with high risk of fire

                                                                                                                                   58

    improving education for safety and accident prevention


toray group is committed to increasing safety education for employees occupational safety and accident prevention
training is incorporated into the curriculums of specialized and levelspecific organizational education programs it includes
direct safety training an effective method for raising hazard awareness through employee participation in crisis situation
simulations each toray group company and plant uses sophisticated training methods which include simulated
productionroll entanglement accidents and explosion demonstration
in addition toray group includes in its inhouse newsletters a section covering safety and accident prevention which is
widely read throughout the group to enhance awareness of safety toray provides a monthbymonth list of occupational
accidents and fire incidents that have occurred over the previous five years to group companies and plants valuable
lessons can be learned from accidents and they are used in safety and accident prevention training to increase awareness
among employees

       torays ishikawa plant manufactures polyester and nylon fibers as well as
       carbon fiber composite material prepeg our plant is not very large so the
       fact that we all see each other at work everyday has allowed us to develop
       original initiatives having adopted the approach of being a good neighbour
       in our relations with the surrounding community we have created a group
       activity we call the sixperson team initiative to encourage mutual
       consideration and care for each other we are also implementing safety
       measures under the slogan be sure to follow established and agreed
       upon procedures we have been building on everyones determined efforts
       in the past and as a result the ishikawa plant has never had an accident
       in 29 consecutive years
       we undertook special activities to improve safety in 2011 particularly with
       regard to machinery with rotating parts this kind of machinery is a source
       of danger in the fiber manufacturing process because the likelihood of
       bodily harm is very high if a worker becomes caught in one as a manager
       at the plant i have been working together with personnel in relevant
       sections to conduct measures aimed at reducing this risk by setting risk

striving to be an even more excellent company by
implementing characteristic csr activities

i was appointed president of torays malaysian subsidiary penfabric in
2008 given the difficult business environment brought on by the global
financial crisis i started various initiatives to build a strong corporate
structure and unite all employees as part of these efforts we started
issuing a weekly email newsletter called csr news for employees who
work at four different factories the newsletter presents my views and
company information and features reports on each factorys progress in
following torays csr guidelines using scorecards as well as links to csr
related news and a csr database csr news has become a useful tool for
us to provide information on company policies and other important
matters frankly writing an article every week is not easy but i believe
sending a message in my own words is important
in may 2012 we launched an initiative to make penfabric greener through
sustainable lifestyles i am confident that our ambitions to protect the
environment and promote sustainability through this initiative will make
penfabric an even more outstanding company

    toray actions on global warming initiatives


toray is steadily carrying out initiatives to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions aiming to maintain annual emissions at
10 or less of the fiscal 1990 level through fiscal 2015
in fiscal 2011 toray reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 3000 tonsco 2 equivalent year on year by improving
manufacturing processes at its gifu plant and mishima plant along with the decline in production volume these factors
resulted in a reduction of 17 of the fiscal 1990 levelsignificantly surpassing the 10 target
although its manufacturing output is expected to rise in line with business expansion toray group will strive to
continuously achieve its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions going forward

                                                                                                                            106

    household ecoaccount book program


with the goal of raising environmental awareness among employees and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of their
households toray group companies in japan initiated the household ecoaccount book program in august 2008 the
program helps employees reduce their household emissions with an online system for keeping monthly records of
consumption of electricity natural gas gasoline and other items and displaying the results of the corresponding co 2
emissions the number of households participating in has grown to 3860 as of march 31 2012 in april 2012 the program
adopted the environmental household accounting system used by kansai electric power company toray group plans to
continue expanding the programs scope in its ongoing efforts to fight global warming

  assessing the potential of biodiversity
with the help of a thirdparty organization toray carried out a basic assessment of its biodiversity potential covering its
12 factories and its basic research laboratories in kamakura japan the assessment focused on how these operational
sites could promote harmony with the ecosystems of the surrounding areas this led to more detailed examinations of the
progress of greening at five of the sites

  increasing green areas
toray carries out greening activities by applying the shrine forest method 1 which it adopted for its basic policies on tree
                                                                                                                                                         120

 disaster response




 toray group is working to upgrade its earthquake countermeasures and business continuity plan while prioritizing
 related tasks specific to each company office and plant and to the group as a whole this process is being driven by
 the lessons learned from the great east japan earthquake and updated estimates of the potential damage in future
 earthquakes




 beginning in early october 2011 four plants operated by two toray group companies temporarily suspended
 operations due to major flooding in thailand with one of the plants sustaining serious damage from inundation with
 floodwater

    toray far exceeded my expectations i was aware that carbon fiber
    accounts for more than half the weight of the new boeing 787 but what i
    didnt expect to see at a carbon fiber exhibition was a nextgeneration
    concept car and a giant turbine blade for a wind power station given that
    carbon fiber is ten times stronger than steel and yet only onefourth the
    weight i can see why it will be used for all kinds of structural materials in
    the future
    when you take a broad view of human history the iron age has lasted a
    very long time but now we really seem to be moving beyond it of course
    todays plastic society represents a postiron age but while plastic has
    been used as a convenient and cheap substitute for traditional materials             takashi tachibana
    this is not the case anymore various materials that are far stronger and             journalist and critic
    much more functional than steel like polymer chemical products and
    synthetic chemical products are becoming the most important materials
    for supporting civilization in the 21st century this major shift was clearly
    demonstrated at the toray advanced materials exhibition
    since the second half of the 20th century our society has gradually
    become centered around composite materials and chemically synthesized
    products in other words we live in a world of synthetic objects produced
    through chemistry as such toray was right to change its slogan to
    innovation by chemistry at the beginning of the 21st century i have no
    doubt that toray will play a significant role in the century to come




    at the 2011 toray advanced materials exhibition visitors could
    experience for themselves some of the worlds most fabled advanced
    materials making them easy to understand and observe the merits of
    these materials were highly impressive and the fact that toray is
    developing sustainable materials demonstrates its sincerity about reducing
    the burden of its corporate activities on the earths environment based on
    a total product lifecycle approach along with this sincerity the approach of
    assessing products over their entire lifecycles is fundamental for
    environmental management so i was highly impressed that the company
    is putting this into practice
    toray is making rapid decisions in its management as it compares and
                                                                                          hiroshi yokoyama director
    assesses numerous products from the two perspectives of environmental
                                                                                          japan environmental
    impact and economic performance it seems like toray group has come
                                                                                          management association
    together and reaffirmed its intention to practice the most progressive
                                                                                          for industry
    environmental management in the world
    through joint development by toray and the japan environmental
    management association the toray ecoefficiency analysis te2a tool
    and our multiple interface life cycle assessment milca tool have been
    upgraded with more functions leading to the worlds most advanced
    environmental management tool designed for the realization of a low
    carbon society which we announced to the public we hope that the more
    widespread usage of this tool will help reduce environmental impact going
    forward i expect that toray groups environmental management will lead
    to even more progress and success in creating new value through the
    worlds most advanced materials

    1 as a flagship model that embodies toray groups green innovation strategy the
    car weighs only 846 kilograms which we achieved using torays molding
    technologies we designed the vehicle with the goal of having cfrp make up 20
    of total weight or about 165 kilograms this resulted in a significant reduction in
    weight compared to similarly sized conventional cars mainly made of steel
    in addition to cfrp we employed toray groups latest technologies and new
    materials such as highly functional films and bioplastics the overall result was a
    very environmentally friendly vehicle
    the design and production of this concept electric car was mainly carried out at the
    automotive center torays integrated technology development facility specializing

    focusing on globally accepted standards for csr to
    secure sustainable growth
   i have been transferred twice to synthetic textile mills and acryl textile mills from
   the time of my first appointment i continuously examined the reasons for the wildly
   fluctuating performance of the two companies and concluded that the main reason
   was not the changing conditions in the market but rather instability in all of their
   operations indeed management policies product quality supervision corporate
   ethics communication the earnings structure and human resources training were
   all out of balance to ensure stability and sustainability these aspects of operations
   have to be made consistent and constant over time without changing significantly
   even when the president or japanese managers changes accordingly we are
   focusing on csr as the basis for globally accepted standards of conduct which must          tsuyoshi sumida
   be respected in any religious or social context and by all individuals furthermore         president of istem and
   we have appointed key personnel as csr advocates and they are steadily instilling           actem as of may 2012

         using my experience playing for the toray
         arrows to help educate children and promote
         sports
         in the previous fiscal year i worked actively to help support the recovery
         of areas affected by the great east japan earthquake because the disaster
         felt very real for me just two months before the earthquake struck i was
         involved in volleyball lessons in the city of rikuzentakata which was
         almost completely destroyed by tidal waves
         therefore i wanted to help in anyway i could no matter how small so i
         traveled to the disaster areas many times each time i went i could feel
         the powerful effect that sports can have in putting smiles on peoples faces          kana oyama
         and raising their spirits and having received so much support during my              corporate communications
         time as a volleyball player i wanted to return my gratitude and make the             department
         most of my experience playing for the toray arrows to help educate kids               toray industries inc
         and promote sports

         the toray arrows volleyball teams have become close to the hearts of

         also engaged in a broad range of community programs providing volleyball
         lessons and joining volunteer activities as ways to actively contribute to
