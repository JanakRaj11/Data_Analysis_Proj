these may appear attractive in the short term

a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with isas will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if individually or in the
aggregate they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements

as part of an audit in accordance with isas we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout
the audit we also

    identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements whether due to fraud or error design and
     perform audit procedures responsive to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
     basis for our opinion the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
     from error as fraud may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations or the override of internal controls
    obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
     the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal controls
    evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related
     disclosures made by the directors
    conclude on the appropriateness of the directors use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence
     obtained whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the companys
     ability to continue as a going concern if we conclude that a material uncertainty exists we are required to draw attention in
     our auditors report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or if such disclosures are inadequate to modify our
     opinion our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors report however future
     events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern
    evaluate the overall presentation structure and content of the financial statements including the disclosures and whether the
     financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation

we communicate with the directors regarding among other matters the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit
findings including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit

we also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence
and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and
where applicable related safeguards

from the matters communicated with the directors we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the
financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters we describe these matters in our auditors report
unless the law or regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when in extremely rare circumstances we determine
that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be
expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication

the engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors report is david waller

d financial instruments
    i classification
    the company classifies all its investments as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category financial instruments
    are classified at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition these include financial assets that are not held for
    trading purposes and which may be sold these are investments in exchangetraded securities and unlisted securities

     financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include accrued dividends

     cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost

     financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include accrued expenses

     ii recognition
     financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially on the trade date which is the date

                                                                                                        vietnam holding annual report 2017




    iv measurement
    fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    market participants at the measurement date in the principal or in its absence the most advantageous market to which the
    company has access at that date the fair value of a liability reflects its nonperformance risk

    when available the company measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that
    instrument a market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and
    volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis the company measures instruments quoted in an active market at
    last traded price

    if there is no quoted price in an active market then the company uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant
    observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs the chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors
    that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction

    the company recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as at the end of the reporting period during which
    the change has occurred

    as at 30 june 2017 the company used quotes obtained from brokers to determine the fair value of an unlisted equity security
    with a carrying value of usd 3864056 which was 184 2016 nil of the net assets of the company while the company
    used valuation techniques to value a convertible bond with a carrying value of usd 1179177 which was 056 2016 13
    of the net assets of the company

    any increases or decreases in values are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an unrealised gain or loss

    v gains and losses on subsequent measurement
    gains and losses arising from a change in the fair value of financial instruments are recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income

    vi impairment
    financial assets that are stated at cost or amortised cost are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there
    is objective evidence of impairment if any such indication exists an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of
    comprehensive income as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash
    flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate

    if in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases
    and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the writedown the impairment is reversed through the
    statement of comprehensive income

    vii cash and cash equivalents
    cash comprises current deposits with banks and fixed deposits cash equivalents are shortterm highly liquid investments that
    are readily convertible to known amounts of cash are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the
    purpose of meeting shortterm cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes

e offsetting
    financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of financial position when and only
    when the company has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and the transactions are intended to be
    settled on a net basis or simultaneously eg through a market clearing mechanism

f amounts due tofrom brokers
    amounts due tofrom brokers represent security purchases and sales transactions which are contracted for but not yet
    delivered at the end of the reporting period


                                                                                                                                          33

2    principal accounting policies continued
g share capital
    ordinary shares
    ordinary shares are classified as equity incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares are recognised as
    a deduction from equity net of any tax effects

     repurchase disposal and reissue of share capital treasury shares
     when share capital recognised as equity is repurchased the amount of the consideration paid which includes directly
     attributable costs net of any tax effects is recognised as a deduction from equity repurchased shares are classified as treasury
     shares and are presented in the reserve for own share account when treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently the
     amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in
     nondistributable capital reserve

h tax
    tax expense comprises current and deferred tax current tax and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the
    extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income

     current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year using tax rates enacted or
     substantively enacted at the reporting date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years

     deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
     financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes the measurement of deferred taxes reflects the
     tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the company expects at the reporting date to recover or settle
     the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to
     temporary differences when they reverse based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
     reporting date

     deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and
     they relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity

     a deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses tax credits and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it
     is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised deferred tax assets are reviewed at
     each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised

     in determining the amount of current and deferred tax the company takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions
     and whether additional taxes and interest may be due the company believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate
     for all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors including interpretations of tax law and prior experience this
     assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events new information
     may become available that causes the company to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities
     such changes to tax liabilities will impact tax expense in the period that such a determination is made

     at present no income profit capital or capital gain taxes are levied in the cayman islands and accordingly no provision for
     such taxes has been recorded by the company in the accompanying financial statements in the event that such taxes are
     levied the company has received an undertaking from the governor in cabinet of the cayman islands exempting it from all
     such taxes for a period of twenty years from 2 may 2006

     the company is liable to vietnamese tax of 01 2016 01 on the sales proceeds of the onshore sale of equity investments

     for certain of the companys financial instruments not carried at fair value such as cash and cash equivalents accrued dividends
     other receivables receivablespayable upon salespurchase of investments and accrued expenses the amounts approximate fair
     value due to the immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments

     other financial instruments are measured at fair value on the statement of comprehensive income

     fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on market conditions and information about the financial
     instrument these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgement and
     therefore cannot be determined with precision changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates

      level 1 inputs that are quoted market prices unadjusted in active markets for identical instruments this level includes
       listed equity securities on exchanges for example ho chi minh stock exchange
      level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable either directly ie as prices or indirectly
       ie derived from prices this level includes instruments valued using quoted prices for identical or similar instruments
       in markets that are considered less than active quoted market prices in active markets for similar instruments or other
       valuation techniques in which all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data
      level 3 inputs that are not based on observable market data ie unobservable inputs this level includes all instruments for
       which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs have a significant
       effect on the instruments valuation

     the table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value at the reporting date by the level in the fair value
     hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised the amounts are based on the values recognised in the

     the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined
     based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety assessing whether an input
     is significant requires judgement including consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability moreover if a fair value
     measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs that fair value
     measurement is a level 3 measurement

    although the company believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate the use of different assumptions could lead to
    different measurements of fair value the directors consider that any reasonably possible changes to the unobservable input
    will not result in a significant financial impact

notes to the financial statements
year ended 30 june 2017



14 earnings per share
     the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share at 30 june 2017 was based on the change in net assets attributable to
     ordinary shareholders of usd27314984 2016 usd31413950 and the weighted average number of shares outstanding of
     55760831 2016 57315656 the warrants of the company had been fully exercised as of 30 june 2017

15 new standards and interpretations not yet adopted
     a number of new standards and amendments to standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 july 2016 and
     earlier application is permitted however the company has not early applied these new or amended standards in preparing these
     financial statements the one new standard potentially relevant to the company is ifrs 9 financial instruments ifrs9 which
     is discussed below

     ifrs 9 published in july 2014 replaces the existing guidance in ias 39 financial instrumentsrecognition and measurement ias
     39 ifrs 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments a new expected credit
     loss model for calculating impairment on financial assets and new general hedge accounting requirements it also carries
     forward the guidance on recognition and derecognition of financial instruments from ias 39

     ifrs 9 is effective for the companys annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 july 2017 with early adoption permitted

     classification of financial assets and financial liabilities
     ifrs 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets measured at amortised cost fair value through other
     comprehensive income fvoci and fair value through profit or loss fvtpl ifrs 9 classification is generally based on the
     business model in which a financial asset is managed and its contractual cash flows the standard eliminates the existing ias
     39 categories of heldtomaturity loans and receivables and availableforsale under ifrs 9 derivatives embedded in contracts
     where the host is a financial asset in the scope of the standard are never bifurcated instead the whole hybrid instrument is
     assessed for classification

     ifrs 9 largely retains the existing requirements in ias 39 for the classification of financial liabilities however although under
     ias 39 all fair value changes of liabilities designated under the fair value option are recognised in profit or loss under ifrs 9
     fair value changes are generally presented as follows

      the amount of change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of the liability is presented in oci and
      the remaining amount of change in the fair value is presented in profit or loss

     based on the companys initial assessment this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the classification of
     financial assets and financial liabilities of the company this is because

      the financial instruments classified as heldfortrading under ias 39 will continue to be classified as such under ifrs 9
      other financial instruments currently measured at fvtpl under ias 39 are designated into this category because they are
       managed on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented investment strategy accordingly these financial instruments
       will be mandatorily measured at fvtpl under ifrs 9 and
      financial instruments currently measured at amortised cost are cash and cash equivalents accrued dividends and other
       receivables these instruments meet the solely principal and interest criterion and are held in a heldtocollect business
       model accordingly they will continue to be measured at amortised cost under ifrs 9

     impairment of financial assets
     ifrs 9 replaces the incurred loss model in ias 39 with an expected credit loss model the new impairment model also applies
     to certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts but not to equity investments under ifrs 9 credit losses are
     recognised earlier than under ias 39 based on the companys initial assessment changes to the impairment model are not
     expected to have a material impact on the financial assets of the company this is because

                                                                                                     vietnam holding annual report 2017




    the majority of the financial assets are measured at fvtpl and the impairment requirements do not apply to such
     instruments and
    the financial assets at amortised cost are shortterm ie no longer than 12 months of high credit quality andor highly
     collateralised accordingly the expected credit losses on such assets are expected to be small
