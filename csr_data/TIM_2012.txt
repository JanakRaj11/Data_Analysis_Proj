in a macroeconomic environment characterised by one of the worst international econom
ic crisis since the end of the war which in just two years 2008 and 2009 reduced gross
domestic product by two percentage points wiping out the slow growth achieved with great
difficulty during the previous five years we have handled the challenges imposed by the
competitive and business environment with courage and determination
the arrival of new players in the world of telecommunication has led to a profound rethink
of the way we are required to operate but we have faced the new competitive environment
with awareness of the values that make us unique

in the four years just ended we have worked tirelessly to cut costs and improve the com
petitiveness of our commercial offerings for the benefit of customers and the market we
have dealt responsibly with the staff redundancies foreseen by the business plan imple
menting solutions agreed with the social partners that have minimised the impact on em
ployees
thanks to the consolidation and relaunch of activities in brazil and argentina we have
been able to rebalance our presence in foreign markets recovering the strong international
vocation that telecom italia had in the past
through a careful management of companys operations we have rebalanced the ratio be
tween debt and cash generation bringing it back to normal levels
we have developed a constructive dialogue with the authorities promoting innovative so
lutions that fulfil requirements in terms of ensuring protection and equality of treatment
between our sales division and alternative operators
we have continued to act incisively with regard to compliance and behavioural practices
transforming our organisational architecture in order to build more effective control sys
tems

responding to customer needs remains the main priority in the groups business strate
gies and the results achieved in terms of improving satisfaction indexes reward the efforts
made although we believe we can do even better
all of this has been done because we believe that a sustainable company is a company
that takes into high consideration its own impacts on the whole system with which it has
to interact in every corporate decision it makes

and it is precisely with the aim of increasing the level of awareness of the importance of
these aspects in the decisionmaking process that we have launched a sustainability train
ing plan dedicated to all employees which will continue throughout 2012 this is a con
crete knowledge development tool based on an elearning platform and on themed virtual
classrooms aimed at creating a common and shared knowledge base within the group

constant attention to technological innovation and process management improvement
has allowed us to increase our energy efficiency and produce significant results including
a 63 reduction in electricity consumption and a 62 reduction in carbon dioxide emis
sions into the atmosphere
our commitment to supporting the values of sustainability has allowed us to achieve im
portant national and international acknowledgements including our inclusion in all the ma
jor global sustainability indexes
we continue to support the united national global compact through our involvement in the
italian network and our reporting of the progress achieved in applying the ten principles

in the near future our group will be required to make important strategic choices the ef
fects of which will extend over the medium to long term when evaluating choices of this
magnitude we need to consider the interests of today as well as those of tomorrow as
sessing their sustainability from all points of view
in developing next generation networks for example we have opted for an architecture
which in addition to being economically efficient is also a solution that allows the great
est energy savings to be achieved
in the future companies and public administrations will increasingly be opting for innova
tive smart service solutions that allow the most efficient use of resources while at the
same time ensuring a reduction in environmental impact and an improvement in citizens
quality of life telecom italia intends to play a leading role in this context

in less than five years our group has changed its expectations prospects behaviour and
fundamental values have changed and its commitment to doing business responsibly has
strengthened in the belief that this is a prerequisite for the success of the group in the
long term

                                                                            franco bernabè

10  executive summary




background


telecom italia began to deal with sustainability in 1997 by creating a specific department
and by publishing the first socioenvironmental report the document then evolved into the
sustainability report and included an analysis of performance in respect of stakeholders
with whom the company interacts on a daily basis the stakeholders as of 2003 the data
and information regarding sustainability became part of the report on operations for the
consolidated financial statements thus confirming the groups intention to present its fi
nancial data together with nonfinancial data
in 2002 telecom italia published the groups first code of ethics and signed up to the
global compact the global pact by the un to promote the protection of the environment
respect for human rights and working standards and anticorruption practices
in 2003 a structured system for managing sustainability based on indicators key perform
ance indicators was implemented to measure the results achieved in respect of all stake
holders and allow appropriate improvement actions to be planned
in 2007 telecom italia participated as coleader in the laboratory set up in the context of
the alliance with the european commission in march 2006 on the evaluation and commu
nication of nonfinancial performance the laboratory then drew up an original communi
cation template investorvalueorg presented in brussels in may 2010 during the senior
leaders forum of the european academy for business in society eabis
the further development of this model is currently under way as part of a project moder
ated by eabis and csr europe in which telecom italia continues to play a leadership role
together with other multinational companies at the end of 2008 sustainability was for
mally brought to the attention of the board of directors through the internal control and
corporate governance committee which performs a senior supervision function in this
respect
in 2009 the sustainability report was drawn up for the first time according to the princi
ples of the aa1000 accountability principles standard aps which are based on on the
involvement of stakeholders in the reporting and the underlying processes this is the
most advanced standard in this area
as a confirmation of the results achieved telecom italia was included in the most prestig
ious international sustainability indexes including the dow jones sustainability indexes
djsi and the financial times stock exchange for good ftse4good



the main sustainability challenges for telecom italia


focus on customers
the achievement of high standards of customer satisfaction is a priority for telecom italia
the formal quality commitments summarised in the customer promise have been the sub
ject of a structured internal dissemination plan through the esprimere qualità express
ing quality project which came to an end in 2011 after more than 2 years and involved
several different departments of the company
in 2011 the listening system was extended to measure quality of service and customer
experience in all contacts made with the company quality is also taken into consideration
in the manager and staff incentives system
as a fundamental player in the broadband ecosystem the telecom italia group is responsi
ble for ensuring that the technological development it brings by offering innovative services
is always associated with the balanced development of the population in terms of com

                                                                             executive summary  11




puter literacy thus contributing to overcoming the sociocultural barriers that can restrict
the opportunity to participate in the information society and enjoy its benefits particular
attention is therefore paid to customers with specific needs or belonging to the weakest
layers of society such as children the elderly the sick and the disabled for example the
smart inclusion project implemented in some italian paediatric hospitals provides a
single technological platform allowing hospitalised children to participate actively in school
lessons communicate with their families and access various entertainment programmes
while allowing healthcare staff to view and update clinical patient documentation as re
gards children safe internet browsing is definitely a priority for telecom italia which now
provides various online protection and control tools it has also launched a navigare in
sieme browsing together project aimed at teaching children teenagers and adults par
ents and teachers to make an informed and responsible use of the internet and digital
technologies for further information see  customers and  the community



closeness to our people
telecom italia confirms its care for the people who work in the company
the people caring initiatives implemented by listening to the needs of employees are
intended to improve the work life balance and to provide a concrete response to the re
quirements of daily life telecom italia supports the involvement of employees in volun
teering initiatives and pays specific attention to diversity within the company talents are
attracted and retained with specific initiatives particularly by establishing direct links with
universities and further education institutions with the i care about myself project for
employees who have passed the required examinations telecom italia covers tuition fees
for a number of degree courses provided by the uninettuno international telematic uni
versity dialogue with employees takes place through various channels including tools
that promote bilateralism exchange and discussion between members of the corporate
community through such things as blogs open virtual communities climate analysis and
the intranet portal a training plan has been launched to inform and involve employees in
matters related to sustainability using an elearning platform and themed virtual classes
for further details of the initiatives taken regarding telecom italia personnel see  human
resources



contribution to the community
as a large company telecom italia has a major impact on the communities of the countries
in which it operates
first of all it contributes to improving general wellbeing by distributing part of the value
produced through salaries and wages payments to suppliers and work providers interest
to capital investors and dividends to shareholders see  economic value produced and
distributed furthermore the investments made are of general benefit to the community
in terms of infrastructure and services while also promoting virtuous effects on the sup
ply chain
the groups contribution to the community also includes products and services that im
prove peoples quality of life by promoting new ways of learning travelling working and
looking after oneself reducing the need for travel and therefore increasing the amount of
free time and improving quality of life in general
one example is the mydoctorhome remote home monitoring service operating in a
number of establishments in piedmont since december 2010 which allows patients suf
fering from a number of chronic diseases to be monitored remotely thanks to telecom ita
lias technologies the service allows the quality of life of patients to be significantly im

proved as well as allowing considerable savings to be made by the healthcare system on
hospitalisation costs by reducing the need to travel to the doctor this service also allows
carbon dioxide co2 emissions generated by the means of transport to be reduced see 
customersinnovative services and  the communityresponses to stakeholders
finally the groups contribution to the community includes projects and initiatives for the
general development of the community by means of cultural solidarity and environmental
protection activities carried out directly by telecom italia through the foundation these
include for example the programme of activities launched with the italian dyslexia as
sociation to combat this disorder in italian schools see  the communityresponses to

fighting climate change
this is one of the great challenges that humanity will have to deal with in the near future
mainly by reducing emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gases in order to limit the in
crease in the earths temperature to levels that are deemed acceptable
the information and communication technology ict industry can play a fundamental role
in this respect not only by limiting its emissions of co2 generated primarily by the high
amount of energy required by transmission networks but also by contributing to reducing
emissions in other sectors by offering innovative services that promote different and more
sustainable lifestyles in environmental terms according to the global esustainability ini
tiative gesi smart 2020 by 2020 ict will be responsible for approximately 3 of world
co2 emissions but will contribute to reducing the co2 emissions of other industrial sectors
by around 15 by means of services such as video conferencing teleworking telemedi
cine and promoting the virtualisation of the economy in general which means replacing
systems with lower impact alternatives in terms of co2 ecommerce etourism online
billing and payments etc ict solutions allow intelligent buildings to be constructed in
which technology combined with new materials considerably improves levels of energy con
sumption comfort and safety by using smart grids these solutions allow energy to be
transferred from areas where there is a surplus to ones where there is a deficit allowing
considerable amounts of energy to be saved with benefits for citizens and companies con
tributing to the creation of more efficient and safer cities with lower co2 emissions in this
respect telecom italia has launched the smart town offer based on an integrated platform
of services for smart cities which uses existing public lighting systems integrated with
telecommunication networks to implement innovative environmental management secu
rity and energy saving services for local authorities and the public for further information

of the process are taken into consideration when planning improvement actions in the fu
ture

10 stakeholder involvement

stakeholder involvement which includes listening to their requests is one of the pillars of
telecom italias sustainability model
during 2010 the sustainability report was submitted to a multistakeholder panel to
measure their satisfaction and the extent to which it fulfilled their expectations the sug
gestions for improvement which were also implemented in the previous report have re
sulted in an increased degree of conciseness and a different graphic design to improve its
legibility and usability

in order to make the group sustainability managers easier to contact and therefore facili
tate dialogue with stakeholders on matters of greatest interest all the necessary details
have been added to the contacts area in the sustainability section of the telecomitalia
com website during the course of 2011 the groupsustainabilitytelecomitaliait mailbox
received around 250 emails all of which were considered for the purpose of any response
required

the following table shows the main initiatives in which stakeholders were involved in com
pany processes classified according to the guidelines recommended by accountability
see reporting except for the initiatives relating to competitors and institutions details
of which can be found in the sustainability section of the telecomitaliacom website

14 customer satisfaction


customer listening at telecom italia
telecom italia has developed a plan for listening to customers that allows the quality of the
service offered and the customer experience to be assessed in the various interactions
between the customer and the company from a recent contact eg to activate a connec
tion ask for information or report a fault to an overall perception over time the results
are used in an ongoing offer improvement process with the aim of providing services that
are ever more responsive to customer needs
the listening system was extended in 2011 and structured into 6
areas                                                                  in 2011 the listening system
 operational processes and events assessed on a reactive ba was extended
   sis ie immediately after a specific event eg delivery assur
   ance sale sales support
 touch point which are the customer contact channels eg points of sale customer
   care web billing
 key products and services eg fixed and mobile broadband smartphones
 lifecycle monitored during the stages that characterise the customers relationship with
   hisher operator
 intangible issues that have a crosscutting impact on customer satisfaction eg inno
   vation
 overall perception measured on a reflective basis ie not connected with a specific
   event the indicator used is the customer satisfaction index csi which by adopting in
   ternational statistical survey standards acsi model measures the perception of qual
   ity according to the main satisfaction drivers in the different types of customer fixed
   consumer mobile consumer fixed business mobile business top clients public sector
   and the similar services provided by the leading competitors during 2011 a new csi
   measurement model was introduced that takes further dimensions into account eg
   sociocultural variables local context etc in december 2011 telecom italia obtained
   from imqcsq a certificate of conformity of its customer satisfaction index csi meas
   urement process with the requirements of the uni 110982003 standard guidelines
   for determining customer satisfaction and for measuring the respective process indica

16 digital divide

the spread of information and communication technology creates considerable opportuni
ties for progress for the public telecom italia is aware of the need to manage this devel
opment in the best way taking on the responsibility for coordinating the actions of all the
players in the broadband ecosystem in order to avoid exposing the community to the risk
of a technological divide due to geographic and sociocultural reasons



geographical digital divide
in order to deal with the technological divide generated in the socalled marginal areas of
italy which would otherwise be excluded from the ordinary plans of telecommunication
operators because of the low return on investments over the years telecom italia has
implemented an exceptional investment programme aimed at providing adsl coverage
of up to 640 kbit in some of these areas telecom italia has also established coopera
tion agreements with several regions and provinces in order to reconcile its corporate
objectives financial business and institutional with those of local authorities both by
activating public tender procedures approved by the eu to finance work using public in
centives and by signing memorandums of understanding with local institutions for the
purpose of simplifying the installation of networks and encouraging their use by citizens
and local authorities
as of december 2011 the gross coverage of telecom italias adsl services meaning the
percentage of lines connected to exchanges where the adsl service has been activated
with a speed of up to 7 mbits reached 971 of the telephone population
for the purpose of local investments there are two main forms of cooperation with the re
gions the first is contributive the socalled clawback method based on direct finan
cial incentives in accordance with the regulatory framework in matters of state aid the
second is collaborative based on supporting potential demand

specifically
 the clawback model is used by the eu to speed up the dissemination of broadband in
  market failure areas the model provides for the allocation of contributions to compen
  sate for the lack of a return on investments disbursed on the basis of a public tender
  this model has been used in the past by the regions of sardinia and tuscany and is cur
  rently being implemented in lombardy
 the collaborative model includes some of the main agreements signed by telecom italia
  during 2011 including the memorandum of understanding with the autonomous prov
  ince of trento

                           the collaboration agreements launched in 2011 also include those signed with the
                            province of lucca which has allowed broadband coverage to be provided in a number of
                            industrial districts and with the province of bolzano according to which all the munici
                            palities of aldo adige will have access to broadband services using fibre optic technol
                            ogy by 2013

                          a contribution to breaking down the sociocultural barriers that restrict the opportunity to
                          take part in the information society allowing people to enjoy its benefits the innovative
                          services aimed at promoting the digitisation of important areas of activity eg healthcare

muoviti
this is an experimental continuous remote monitoring application for people with motor
problems it allows healthcare staff to monitor the amount of movement made by patients
even outside rehabilitation times and at home after they have been discharged the as
sumption is that this will allow daily doses of medicine to be adapted and the frequency of
hospital visits to be reduced
the system uses sensors worn by the patient which process the data locally and send the
results to a mobile phone the mobile phone runs algorithms that estimate movement and
recognise posture and the information regarding the patients motor status are send to the
telecom italia remote monitoring platform to be read remotely by authorised personnel doc
tors relations carers etc
the application is based on the spine framework an open source project managed by tel
ecom italia and developed in association with the academic world particularly the university
of calabria the university of california in berkeley and the university of texas in dallas

the group has also implemented appropriate filtering and abuse prevention systems for
services delivered in brazil and argentina in particular wap services with adult content
require user authentication while the delivery of adult videos on ip platforms which is
only available in on demand mode requires a pin to be entered and a parental control
code to be activated

19 conciliation procedures

the conciliation procedure between telecom italia and the consumer associations who
signed the framework agreement for the outofcourt settlement of telephone disputes
was the first example of joint conciliation in italy introduced on a trial basis in 1991 by
sip it was implemented throughout the country in 1993 in 1995 it was substantially rec
ognised by the european union as a pilot project for consumer access to justice the
model is still used today but has been adapted over the years to fulfil new requirements
computerised and made easier to use while maintaining the basic values that made it
such an excellent tool contributing to improving the transparency of the system cus
tomer relations and a number of the companys operational processes as well twenty
consumer associations have signed up to the conciliation agreement to date
in 2009 telecom italia in compliance with the voluntary undertakings given and approved
by the italian communications authority agcom in december 2008 also started manag
ing conciliation requests submitted by customers at the offices of corecom and the
chambers of commerce thus providing a one stop shop for contacts and replicating the
organisational model successfully applied for joint conciliations this system allows cus
tomers who do not wish to approach a consumer association to use an alternative method
for resolving their dispute through a streamlined and outofcourt procedure
as for joint conciliations the management of conciliations at the
offices of corecom and the chambers of commerce is based the one stop shop aimed to solve
on an approach that considers the needs of the customer and disputes has proved to be an effective
regardless of the procedure selected allows the customers rela tool well appreciated by customers
tionship with the company to be improved
the one stop shop model has thus far allowed the undertakings given to agcom to
be fulfilled and the qualitative and numeric targets to be achieved in 2011 the number
of conciliation requests submitted to corecom and chamber of commerce offices fell
by 143 from 21681 to 185853 of these applications 878 were discussed in 3
that same year and 122 were cancelled there are no received applications awaiting consistent with the fall in the number
                                                                                             of joint conciliation requests received
discussion the percentage of conciliation requests discussed at corecom and cham in the same period 136 from
ber of commerce offices and settled during the period compared to the total number 7095 to 6246
of applications discussed during the same period was 875 125 were not settled

                  vacy code in the performance of its business activities telecom italia has equipped itself
                  with an organisation model that assigns central departments the responsibility for super
                  vising correct application of the regulations in this sector at group level in this context
                  when it establishes or acquires new companies the parent company provides the support
                  required to identify and carry out the formalities required to comply with the relevant legal
                  and regulatory provisions
                  legal provisions and the instructions of the italian data protection authority are transposed
                  by constantly updating the groups regulations and policies the system of rules for the
                  application of privacy regulations in the telecom italia group is particularly significant in
                  this respect it establishes the provisions and operating instructions needed to carry out
                  the relevant formalities
                                           in order to ensure the dissemination and correct application of

within the telecom italia group the procurement process is aimed at the acquisition of
products and services under the best possible market conditions at the same time guar
anteeing the prerequisites of quality safety and respect for the environment the procure
ment process is based on a competitive comparison of the technicaleconomic offerings
of suppliers who are selected on the basis of wellfounded company procedures at group
level and bearing the hallmark of ethical dealings
the group is committed to guaranteeing the quality of the procurement process and its
continual improvement in the light too of sustainable procurement by obtaining the re
spective certification of quality



22 relevant stakeholders

the relevant stakeholders are the suppliers and subsuppliers from which the group ac
quires goods andor services



23 general matters

the selection assessment and control of telecom italia groups suppliers for high risk
procurement sectors involves a precontractual qualification stage in which the economic

50  external stakeholders  suppliers




financial and technicalorganisational characteristics are assessed verification of these
characteristics leads to inclusion in the register of suppliers the group requires every
supplier to make a commitment on behalf of the company in question and any authorised
subcontractors collaborators and employees to observe the principles of ethics and
conduct contained in the groups code of ethics
registered companies which have received purchase orders normally undergo checks
during the supply period including incoming quality control a requirement for the accept
ance and use of the purchased goods and monitoring of the vendor rating systematic
assessment of the supply
the supply chain  real estate scre department is split into purchasing divisions
that focus on specific sectors so as to provide accurate responses to the requirements
of internal customers and stakeholders these expectations are constantly monitored
through surveys of both internal customers and suppliers in order to verify the quality of
the services delivered see  involvement initiatives



24 sustainability initiatives

the main initiatives implemented in 2011 are listed below
 the process that establishes the activities aimed at improving the corporate social
  responsibility csr of the supply chain has been redesigned by introducing a more
  comprehensive system of elements used to assess the sustainability of suppliers dur
  ing the qualification stages incoming quality and vendor rating
  the most significant aspects of the process include
   the creation of a selfassessment questionnaire for new suppliers during the qual
     ification phase the questionnaire was developed according to the main require
     ments contained in the relevant standards for responsible corporate management
     relating to respect for ethical values and to safeguarding the environment including
     sa 8000 global compact and iso 14000 and to the best industry practices the
     questionnaire will be updated periodically to reflect the results and evolution of the
     qualification process
   the classification of suppliers based on the potential risks associated with their
     sustainability performance using a specific method which considers the socio
     environmental and business continuity aspects associated with the purchase mar
     kets to which the suppliers belong classified according to parameters such as
     relevant geographical area potential impact on the environment and the company
     of suppliers activities and of the productsservices supplied throughout their life
     cycle impact on the reputation of telecom italia as a customer a matrix has been
     constructed that relates the spending in the specific purchase market with the risk
     index calculated on the basis of the parameters described which has allowed pur
     chase markets to be subdivided into four categories identifying the most critical
     ones in terms of sustainability
     suppliers belonging to the most at risk categories will undergo csr audits carried
     out by staff from the company or specialised third party companies these audits
     will be repeated periodically non only to monitor and ensure the implementation of
     corrective action but also if results are positive in order to verify that the standard
     of performance found by auditors is being maintained
     the activities described are intended to promote the improvement of sustainability
     performance throughout the supply chain and to identify a category of sustainable
     purchases sustainable procurement

     the whole process is expected to come into full operation in 2012 for 2011 an ex
     perimental questionnaire was sent out to around 70 significant suppliers identified
     by the method described above which allowed around 44 of orders made in 2011
     by the domestic business unit to be covered
 in december 2011 the iso 90012008 certificate of conformity of the quality man
  agement system was confirmed for the groups entire scre department with spe
  cific recognition for the initiatives taken in the field of sustainability the certification
  required 27 department processes to be mapped identifying 155 performance indica
  tors that allow the management of services supplied to internal clients and suppliers
  to be monitored and improved furthermore the iso 14001 certification was confirmed
  for the facility and real estate service unit and infrastructure purchases
 application continued of the green procurement policy established in 2009 which con
  tains guidelines for establishing the environmental requirements of productsservices
  purchased
  the policy covers all stages of the product life design production use and end of life
  published on the supplier portal of telecom italia and in the sustainability section of
  the telecomitaliacom website the document contributes to orienting purchasing poli
  cies towards low environmental impact products and services
  with a view to ensuring the ongoing improvement and greater involvement of suppli
  ers questions regarding the green procurement policy and supplier adherence to the
  principles set out within it have been included in the annual satisfaction survey see
   involvement initiatives

26 involvement initiatives

 the new suppliers portal vendors hub was launched during the year to improve com
  munication and optimise operational processes applying social networking systems to
  a business context
  suppliers are able to access a private area to view important data and events connect
  ed to their relationship with telecom italia and manage all their own details thus improv
  ing the smooth operation and transparency of the relationship the vendors hub also
  includes a public area containing information for potential suppliers
  documentation is exchanged electronically eg offers purchase orders contracts
  qualification documentation surveys thus reducing the environmental impact resulting
  from the use of paper and transporting of documents the vendors hub has also been
  used to manage the selfassessment questionnaire see  sustainability initiatives
 for the fifth year in a row the groups main suppliers have been involved in satisfaction
  surveys regarding the supply chain  real estate department and more generally tel

  trend in the level of satisfaction recorded since 2008 the analysis of the distribution
  of satisfaction among the various classes shows an upward trend in the percentage of
  suppliers who state they are satisfied or very satisfied
 the two ecommunities set up in previous years for suppliers in the civil infrastructure
  and network operations sectors aimed at improving dialogue mainly regarding social
  and environmental sustainability remain active
  the activities of the ecommunities mainly take place through a platform known as te

 heating




the data in the table relating to telecom italia spa show that compared to 2010 con
sumption for heating purposes has remained substantially unchanged and that consump
tion has been falling significantly compared to 2009 when the large cogeneration plants
came into service installed in a number of data processing centres these plants produce
electricity and heat at the same time resulting in a reduction in the purchase of fossil fuels
used exclusively to heat working environments
in brazil the climate makes it unnecessary to heat indoor premises and in argentina
heating is only required for short periods of time and primarily in the coldest areas of
the country

at telecom italia spa the significant containment of energy consumption for transport
is due partly to the reduction in the distance travelled and partly to the greater efficiency
achieved in managing the fleet of vehicles implementation of the policy to reduce and
modernise the fleet with vehicles that comply with more rigorous environmental stand
ards was slower than expected in 2011 primarily because of budgetary restrictions and
involved just 600 vehicles instead of the expected 2500 this resulted in a failure to
achieve the target for reducing co2 emissions by replacing vehicles see  2010 and 2011

hydrochlorofluorocarbons hcfc and hydrofluorocarbons hfc in terms of equivalent co2 emissions are determined by reference to specific global warming potential
gwp parameters for the two gases the index is based on a relative scale that compares the gas considered with an equal mass of carbon dioxide with a gwp of 1 the
gwp of hcfc used was 1780 and that of hfc was 1300 in 2009 however a single parameter was used without differentiating between the types of gas dispersed

in determining the impact of homework commuting reference is made to statistical data produced on the companys personnel

air travel emissions were calculated based on the individual journeys actually made and the coefficients suggested by the ghg protocol differentiating between short
and longhaul flights

cluding 121644 modems 640 iptv set top boxes 35900 fixedline telephony products
and 150679 other material related to technical logistics the purpose of this activity is
twofold to help reduce weee while at the same time generating savings an economic ben
efit from the nonpurchase of new equipment which more than covers the reconditioning
cost of these products
for adsl modems home gateway a review has been carried out of the reconditioning and
disposal processes in the event of a failure or at the end of their useful life in order to re
duce the environmental impacts of these stages but also to identify solutions that improve
the choice of materials and the methods for disassembling future products part of this
analysis has already been used to build the new telecom italia wifi n modem which inau
gurated the new range of green products in 2011 see product responsibility
an awarenessbuilding campaign is taking place at telecom argentina urging customers to

reducing emissions
the environmental impact of telecom italia in terms of co2 emissions is determined as
shown in the preceding paragraphs by direct emissions from the use of fossil fuels indi
rect emissions through the procurement of electricity and other indirect emissions due for
example to homework commuting and air travel by staff
for information on the initiatives launched to reduce energy consumption and therefore
indirect emissions see  energy



ecoefficiency indicator
telecom italia spa measures its own energy efficiency by using an indicator that estab
lishes a relationship between the service offered to the customer in terms of bits transmit
ted and the companys impact on the environment represented by joules of energy con
sumed the factors taken into consideration are the amounts of data and voice traffic of
the fixedmobile networks and energy consumption for industrial purposes transmission
and cooling equipment in exchanges offices lighting air conditioning and heating and
vehicles
the following table and chart show the values and trend of the ecoefficiency indicator over
the past three years
in 2011 the indicator value exceeded expectations and work continues with an objective
of 2450 bitjoule being set for 2012 an increase of 11 compared to the figure for
2011 see 2012 objectives in the appendix

fund raising
fund raising is a particularly important tool especially when it comes to dealing with emer

associated with humanitarian scientific or environmental projects which it supports by al
lowing people to make a donation of 1 or 2 euros by sending a text message and of up to
10 euros by calling a dedicated free number from a land line
the money raised was passed on in its entirety without any deductions either by the tax
authorities who thanks to an awareness campaign mounted by tlc companies and non
profit organisations have exempted such operations from the application of vat nor by the
company for the disbursement of its costs

       comparison between the economic and financial information and data included in the
        report with those included in the group consolidated financial statements as of 31
        december 2011
       analysis of design and implementation of governance and management system of
        sustainability topics related to strategy and operation of telecom italia spa as well as of
        the processes and instruments used to identify the stakeholders and the most significant
        issues to them
       analysis of the processes underlying the generation recording and management of
        quantitative data included in the report in particular we held meetings and discussions
        with telecom italia spa telecom italia media spa tim participaçoes sa telecom
        argentina sa and hr services srl management representatives selected on the basis of a
        quantitative and qualitative risk analysis in order to achieve a general understanding of the
        information accounting and reporting system in use to prepare the report as well as of the
        internal control processes and procedures supporting the collection aggregation
        processing and transmission of data and information to the department responsible for
        drawing it up
       meetings and discussions with telecom italia spa telecom italia media spa tim
        participaçoes sa telecom argentina sa and hr services srl management in order to
        understand and evaluate the processes utilized to comply with the inclusivity materiality
        and responsiveness principles included in the aa1000aps  2008 standard
       analysis on a sample basis of the documentation supporting the report in order to obtain
        the evidence of processes in place confirm the reliability of data and information obtained
        in the abovementioned meetings and discussions and regarding the sustainability
        performance as included in appendix 1
       verification of the engagement of stakeholders through
            analysis of the most relevant aspects arisen and documented in internal minutes and
             comparison with data and information included in the report
            meetings and interviews with some employees to understand their awareness on the
             sustainability reporting process
       obtaining a representation letter signed by the legal representative of telecom italia spa
        relating to the completeness and reliability of the report and of the information and data
        included in it as well as to the compliance with the principles referred to in paragraph 1
    a limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement
    carried out in accordance with isae 3000 and as a consequence it provides a lower level of
    assurance that we became aware of all the significant events and circumstances that a
    reasonable assurance engagement could have identified




                                                                                                 2 di 3

      as far as data and information concerning the sustainability report of the prior year presented
      for comparative purposes are concerned refer to the assurance statement we issued on 28
      march 2011
4     based on the procedures carried out nothing came to our attention that causes us to believe that
      the sustainability report of telecom italia group as of 31 december 2011 is not in compliance in
      all material respects with aa1000 accountability principles standard 2008 as stated in the
      paragraph reporting of the report and that the sustainability performance included in
      appendix 1 is not reliable
