continued soft demand in the
public research sector

a proportion of the demand for our laboratory
products comes from public sector research in many
countries research budgets have been declining as a
result of excessive public debt according to frost 
sullivan demand from the public research sector in
the reporting year was slightly below the prioryear
level


competition

the primary means by which companies in the
biotechnology market differentiate themselves from
competitors are innovative prowess and the quality
and performance of their products the biotechnology
sector is constantly discovering new areas of
application and expects suppliers to be equally fast
moving and creative in developing new equipment for
the manufacture of biotech products new suppliers
in particular seek to exploit the opportunities
inherent in this environment to gain a foothold in the
market with carefully targeted niche products the
more established suppliers meanwhile are expanding
their product range continuously

we generate round 90 of our sales revenue from
validated processes in which replacing products during
the production cycle is very expensive so we receive a
high proportion of followup and repeat business the
particular strength of sartorius stedim biotech lies in
its integrated process solutions from the investigation
and development of substances in the lab to the
production of the end product we offer the broadest
range in the industry our strategic focus on singleuse
products gives us another edge over the competition
sartorius stedim biotech occupies a strong position in
the market worldwide in the fields of bioprocess
filtration fermentation fluid management and
membrane chromatography

most of our competitors are multinationals based in
the usa emd millipore pall and general electric
healthcare are among our main rivals in the process
area thermo fisher and emd millipore are key players
in the laboratory field we also face competition from
smaller companies such as applikon in individual
segments

countermeasures and  or arranged for balance sheet
measures during the reporting year to cover all
discernible risks within the sartorius stedim biotech
group that had the potential to damage our net worth
financial situation and profitability

we judge the probability of occurrence of the risks
presented here to be low it being the case that their
occurrence can be significant for the sartorius stedim
biotech group as a whole or for individual group
companies

after thorough analysis of the entire risk situation and
according to our current review there are no
discernible risks at present that could jeopardize the
continued existence of the group

similarly based on our current review there are no
discernible risks that could jeopardize the future
existence of the group

          according to the situation of each company size industry
          broad or narrow scope of the award number of officers etc
          the board must define the maximum percentage of options

          directors as compared with the aggregate award approved
          by shareholders the resolution for authorizing the award
          plan submitted to a vote at the meeting of shareholders must
          mention this maximum percentage in the form of an award

          awards are made at the same calendar periods eg after the
          disclosure of the financial statements for the previous
          financial year and probably each year in order to limit any
          windfall effects
          any windfall effects associated with a bear market are
          prohibited the value of awarded options and performance
          shares may not be markedly different from the companys
          earlier practices unless a material change in the scope of
          business justifies a revision of the scheme
          in accordance with terms determined by the board and
          announced upon the award the performance shares awarded
          to executive directors are conditional upon the acquisition
          of a defined quantity of shares once the awarded shares
          are available

of an intangible asset is the period over which this
asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to
the cash flows of that entity

costs incurred within the scope of the development of

  use or sell it

 the ability to use or sell the intangible asset

 the demonstration of how the intangible asset will
  generate probable future economic benefits

 the availability of adequate technical financial and
  other resources to complete the development and to
  use or sell the intangible asset

that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be           significant management judgment and review of
recorded at their respective fair values on the date the      individual receivables based on individual customer
group obtains control the application of the                 creditworthiness and current economic trends as well
acquisition method requires certain estimates and             as an analysis of historical bad debts on a portfolio

this measurement is based to a large extent on                benefits are determined in accordance with actuarial
anticipated cash flows if actual cash flows vary from        valuations these valuations rely on key assumptions
those used in calculating fair values this may               including discount rates expected salary increases and
materially affect the groups future results of               mortality rates the discount rate assumptions are

                                                              due to changing market and economic conditions the
an impairment test is conducted if certain events lead       underlying key assumptions may differ from actual
to the assumption that an asset might be impaired in         developments and may lead to significant changes in
this case the carrying amount of the asset is                pension and other postemployment benefit obligations
compared to the recoverable amount which is the
higher of the net realizable value and the value in use      such differences are recognized in full directly in
the calculation of the value in use is generally based        equity in the period in which they occur without
on discounted cash flow methods that are using cash           affecting profit or loss for a sensitivity analysis see
flow projections up to five years these projections          note 23 pension and employee benefits provisions
take into account past experiences and represent
managements best estimate about future sales
revenue and cost developments cash flows after the           provisions contingent liabilities and
planning period are extrapolated using individual             contingent assets
growth rates key assumptions on which management
has based its determination of the value in use include       provisions are recognized for legal or constructive
estimated growth rates weighted average cost of              obligations that exist as of the balance sheet date
capital and tax rates these estimates can have a             to determine the amount of the obligations certain
material impact on the respective values and                  estimates and assumptions have to be applied
ultimately the amount of any impairment if the               including the evaluation of the probability and
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount an            the amount of costs incurred typically significant
impairment loss is recorded                                  estimates are involved in the determination of
                                                              provisions related to onerous contracts warranty costs

      the goodwill recognized represents the assets that
      have not been separately identified and recognized
      but that will also generate economic benefits to the
      group here especially the expansion of the groups
      portfolio and its strengthened position in the relevant
      biopharmaceutical market as well as synergies
      resulting from the combination are to be named the
      sartorius stedim biotech group has chosen to
      recognize the amount of noncontrolling interest at
      the level of the prorated share of net identifiable
      assets without goodwill partial goodwill method

      deferred taxes were not recognized upon initial
      consolidation due to the structure of the transaction
      in future periods deferred tax liabilities will be
      recognized on the arising taxable temporary difference
      because the full amount of goodwill is deductible for
      local tax purposes

      the inclusion of the company in the scope of
      consolidation from january 1 on would not have had a
      significant impact on the groups figures due to the
      low business volume of that activity since the
      acquisition date the acquired company has not
      contributed materially to the groups results either

      the transaction costs of 02 million were recognized
      in other expenses

            same period any artificial increase in compensation aimed at increasing
            pension benefits
            it is necessary to exclude any schemes giving a right immediately or over
