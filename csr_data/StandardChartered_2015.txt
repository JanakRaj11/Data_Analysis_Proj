   most likely we then derive the nps by subtracting the percentage of detractors
   those who score zero to six from the percentage of promoters those who score

additional notes on environment data
the emissions within our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014 this is to allow
sufficient time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publication of results accordingly the operating income used
corresponds to the same period rather than calendar year used in financial reporting this is consistent with international carbon
reporting practice
measured data is collected from global environment management system gems properties defined as all properties that are
over 10000 square feet the groups pwc assurance report for measured scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions can be
found on page 20
scaledup data is an extrapolation made from measured data to account for 100 per cent of the groups occupied property
footprint as at the end of the reporting period
in accordance with guidance issued by the uk development for environment food and rural affairs defra in 2014 we have
included scope 3 emissions with equivalent distance uplift from 2012 which is our baseline year the groups reporting criteria
can be found at sccomenvironmentcriteria
onsite renewable energy generation is not included in the energy intensity calculation all other forms of renewable energy
are included
carbon abatement benefit from indirect renewable energy is not taken into account
total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period
net internal areas used for water use intensity do not include sites that have reported zero water consumption in demised areas
warehouses empty land car parks unoccupied sites for business continuity purposes residential properties space occupied
by automated teller machines vaults and space sublet to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation
scope 3 emissions are drawn from reliable data collected from 41 countries based on seating class and distance flown
as we operate largely outside of the uk all flights domestic or international with flight distance 463km labelled by defra
as domestic flights have been classified as short haul all flights with distance flown ranging from 463 to 1108km labelled
by defra as short haul have been classified as medium haul
