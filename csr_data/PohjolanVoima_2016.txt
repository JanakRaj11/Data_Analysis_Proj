pohjolan voima produces sustainable finnish energy
we are currently experiencing an energy revolution that will irreversibly change the fundamentals of our energy system the production volume of renewable
energy will clearly increase and this increase is being speeded up by a variety of support schemes the share of weatherdependent electricity production in the
nordic markets has increased quickly wholesale electricity price has dropped and price fluctuations are high investments in new electricity production on
market terms have ceased old and unprofitable power plants are closed down at a quickening pace the era of condensing power plants that produce
electricity will soon be behind us the next electricity production method to face the profitability challenge will be combined heat and power the closing of
condensing power plants also deletes a major part of our supply security in the years to come finland will be even more dependent on imported electricity
than now the risk of a shortage of power will increase and compromise our energy security the future outlook of the energy industry is unclear

in 2015 pohjolan voima continued the development of its focus areas  hydropower thermal power and nuclear power  as well as the streamlining of its
operations to be able to respond to future challenges in this unsecure operating environment


year of records in hydropower
in 2015 our hydropower company finished the overhaul project of the melo power plant along the kokemäenjoki river a comprehensive renovation of the
plants along the iijoki river was completed earlier next pohjolan voima will modernise its isohaara hydropower plant along the kemijoki river the power
plants are in good condition and their energy efficiency is excellent due to the recent renovations we reached our best hydropower production volume ever
23 twh in 2015 the recordbreaking production volume was caused by heavy rainfall and excellent availability of the power plants at the same time a
record volume of energy  almost 05 twh of renewable finnish energy  was lost due to diversion if the floodwaters of the iijoki river could be stored in
kollaja reservoir we could obtain more power balancing power in particular from the iijoki power plants the town of pudasjärvi has announced that it
supports the kollaja project and the case is now being processed by national decisionmakers

we wish to increase our efforts to restore migratory fish to the iijoki and kemijoki rivers after a joint basic research period of several years the restoration of
migratory fish took a step towards concrete action when an iijoki waterway vision project managed by the oulu regional council was launched


production operation of condensing power plants closed down
a new backup boiler was commissioned at laanilan voimas biopower plant in oulu a reception and processing system for recycled fuels was inaugurated at
the rauman biovoima power plant in rauma it enables a major increase in the utilisation of recycled fuels furthermore hämeenkyrö biopower plant made
preparations for increasing the utilisation of recycled fuels

demolition of the mussalo power plant in kotka was completed production operations at kristiinankaupunki and pori tahkoluoto coalfired condensing
power plants ceased the plants were no longer profitable on market terms due to the low prices on the electricity market with the closing down of the kotka
mussalo kristiinankaupunki and pori tahkoluoto power plants around 800 mw of balancing power was removed from the finnish power supply system


olkiluoto 3 project advanced posiva received construction permit
olkiluoto nuclear power plant produces reliable domestic base load power work on the ol3 plant unit advanced and the commissioning stage of the
construction project will start soon the government granted posiva oy a construction permit for a final disposal facility of spent nuclear fuel thus posiva
received recognition for its more than forty years of rd work towards a safe final disposal solution for spent nuclear fuel posiva has started commercialisation
of its expertise aiming at providing services in the international markets

responsible energy production
we updated our corporate responsibility policy last year in 2016 we will focus on the following projects improving traceability of fuel supply chains
promoting interaction with nongovernmental organisations promoting responsible ways of working among our personnel and updating social influence
practices to make them more transparent the theme of our stakeholder event was responsible energy policy we discussed the current reform in the energy
industry as well as the challenges and future of the energy system


return to marketbased approach
if nothing is changed the foundation of the finnish energy system will quickly and irreversibly crumble a marketbased approach should be restored as soon
as possible a marketbased energy system is the best and most efficient alternative for both energy users and society at large support schemes for renewable
electrical energy should be abandoned we should rely on emissions trading to reduce the emissions from electricity production and we should eliminate any
governing systems that overlap with the emissions trading system

the future belongs to low emission and carbonneutral production methods but the other production methods still have their own roles for the time being
the energy system will require both centralised and distributed electricity production also in the future nuclear power is finnish base load power the
atmosphere should be made favourable towards the investments that finland sorely needs at this point when updating the national energy and climate
strategy we should try to obtain a comprehensive idea of the development needs of the finnish energy system and its links to the nordic and european energy
systems we need a bridge that will lead us from the current situation back to a marketbased system


new domestic balancing power capacity needed in finland
the strongly increasing wind power production results in large and rapid variations of production volume that are difficult to predict and that increase the
need for balancing power as the condensing power plants are no longer available hydropower is even more significant as a method to balance electricity
production and consumption decisionmakers should be bold enough to allow sustainable hydropower construction in already harnessed rivers for pohjolan
voima this would mean collecting the floodwaters of the iijoki river in the kollaja reservoir


joint resources  with skill with courage together
pohjolan voima effectively supplies electricity and heat for its shareholders at cost price in this way we secure the success of our customers and our
operations indirectly create jobs and wellbeing for society as a whole when taking into account the challenging operating environment we were very
successful in this task in 2015 i wish to warmly thank our employees shareholders and partners

joint resources are the basis from which we tackle any future challenges  with skill with courage together

pohjolan voima stopped its wind power production in 2011


highest hydropower production volume in history
pohjolan voima has a total of 12 hydropower plants located along the iijoki kemijoki kokemäenjoki and tengeliönjoki rivers the combined electricity
generation capacity of the plants is 508 mw of which pohjolan voimas share is 443 mw in 2015 a record 23 twh of electricity was produced using
hydropower the high production volume was due to the near recordbreaking hydrological year longlasting spring floods and high precipitation particularly
in the kemijoki and iijoki areas the availability of the hydropower plants was also excellent the power plants are in good condition and their energy efficiency
is excellent due to the recent restorations over the past few years pohjolan voima has invested approximately 60 million in the restoration of hydropower
plants and hydropower capacity increases

low market price of electricity resulted in decreased thermal power production
in its thermal power production pohjolan voimas total capacity is 1428 mw of which 595 mw is combined heat and power production and 833 mw is
condensing power production the specialised electricity production or condensing power production capacity will decrease to 146 mw because the
production operation of the power plants in kristiinankaupunki kristiina 2 and pori tahkoluoto and the power reserve plants in kristiinankaupunki kristiina
1 and vaskiluoto vaskiluoto 3 has ceased the plants were closed down because they had become unprofitable due to the low market price of electricity

combined heat and power plants produce district heat and process steam for local industry and communities and also electricity in 2015 the heat output of
the combined heat and power plants was 53 twh compared to 66 twh in 2014 and the electricity output was 21 twh 27 twh the decrease was
caused by the warm winter and the fact that three power plants were sold from pohjolan voima condensing power plants produced 04 twh of electricity
12 twh

in 2015 thermal power plants consumed 22 twh of coal 75 twh of woodbased fuels 19 twh of peat and 04 twh of recycled fuel oil and natural gas
are used as start and backup fuels

longterm management of the water environment
hydropower production has regional and local impacts on waterways and fish stocks in order to fulfil its obligation to sustain the fish stocks of the kemijoki
and iijoki waterways and the sea area pvovesivoima stocked around 278 million fry in 2015 together with kemijoki oy 50 million fry were stocked in the
kemijoki sea and river area of these pvovesivoima oys share was 17 or 08 million fry



          did you know
              the transport of river lamprey past dams and power stations was fairly successful in both the iijoki and the kemijoki river even
              though the transport catching plans were not fully realised 66000 river lampreys were transported in iijoki river the minimum
              required number is 60000 specimens in the kemijoki river the joint obligation of pvovesivoima and kemijoki oy is 100000
              transported specimens a total of 130000 river lampreys were transported in the kemijoki river in 2015 the obligations are evened
              out in a threeyear period in good years the number transported exceeds the obligation due to the continuing deficit in the
              kemijoki river pvovesivoima oy and kemijoki oy have increased the volume of river lamprey being caught at the isohaara power
              plant the results from experiments with new catching locations and methods have been encouraging


in cooperation with the iijoki region municipalities pvovesivoima participates in a threeyear waterway vision project called iijoen otva the project was
launched by the oulu regional council in late 2015 the main goals of the project are a shared vision on waterways promotion of the restoration of migrating
fish protection of the baltic sea salmon population and promotion of smaller development measures that will increase the rivers value

to restore the migrating fish the project will promote arrangements along the iijoki river fishways and fishing arrangements required to restore the migrating
fish develop efficient smart technologies plan a downward migration route for migrating fish in the iijoki river supplement plans on raasakka fishways into
building plans for which offers can be requested as well as complete a preliminary study on increasing the fishery and recreational value of the old raasakka
river basin and an environmental flow pilot project

in 2015 inspections in compliance with the dam safety act to be held every five years took place at the isohaara dam in the kemijoki river


production affects thermal power emissions
pohjolan voimas thermal power plants use wood fuel peat coal and refusederived fuels as primary fuels and some natural gas and oil as auxiliary fuels the
most significant environmental impact of thermal power production concerns the atmosphere the power plants emissions into the air vary according to the
fuel and the production volumes of electricity and thermal power

in 2015 the carbon dioxide emissions from the thermal power production decreased to 15 million tonnes mainly due to the reduced consumption of coal at
the same time the characteristic carbon dioxide emissions from electricity production decreased to 84 g co2kwh

the industrial emissions ie directive which entered into force in january 2011 has posed a major challenge to the future of thermal power production in
finland the directive has been enforced through the upgrade of the environmental protection act and some related decrees the directive establishes rigorous
requirements on power plants emissions into the air these requirements will not however apply to existing power plants until in 2016 at the earliest

some of the power plants of pohjolan voima are included in the national ie directive transition plan approved by the european commission in the spring of
2014 the transition plan allows the committed power plants some flexibility in the adoption of the new rigorous emission limits with the transition period
ending in june 2020

to most of pohjolan voimas boilers the challenges lie in cutting nitrogen oxide nox emissions furthermore the ie directive establishes that bat conclusions
made on the basis of the best available techniques reference documents will become binding the eu is currently updating the reference document on best
available techniques for large combustion plants lcpbatbref based on the draft reference document the emission limits are expected to become more
stringent pohjolan voima is currently investigating potential technological means of reaching the emission level requirements with economically and technically
viable solutions

pohjolan voimas thermal power plants received new environmental permit decisions in 2015 applications for the review of the environmental permits were
submitted in 2014 because the new environmental protection act that entered into force in 2014 required them from large combustion plants


record level of byproduct utilisation
a total of 155 thousand tonnes of fly ash bottom ash and gypsum were produced fly ash and gypsum as byproducts from flue gas cleaning in the context of
the power plants combustion process of this volume 166 was reutilised in earth construction the construction industry or as forest fertiliser in 2015 the
utilisation of the byproducts exceeded their production volume as byproduct storages accumulated in previous years were utilised

the aim of pohjolan voima is to reuse as much as possible of the byproducts of thermal power production as raw material that can be used to replace non
renewable natural resources such as rock and stone

nuclear power production complied with environmental permits
the operations of the nuclear power plant units owned by tvo a joint venture partially owned by pohjolan voima complied with the companys
environmental policy environmental permits and environmental management system

the greatest environmental impact of the olkiluoto nuclear power plant results from the heat released into the sea via cooling waters any other environmental
effects are negligible as was the case in previous years radioactive emissions into the air and water were minimal and considerably below the authorised limits

ostrobothnia in march 2015 the town of pudasjärvi decided to endorse the project we want to continue to promote the project in cooperation with local
residents also in the future the project can only be implemented if the rapids protection act is revised

the kollaja project represents a new approach to hydraulic engineering where natural values are one of the projects cornerstones the project can be
implemented while retaining the characteristics of the rapids and respecting the fish habitats and natural values preparation of the project continued with
hydrological modelling impact of the project on fish habitats are studied in a survey by the natural resources institute finland and the impact of the project on
reindeer farming are studied in a survey by the university of eastern finland in cooperation with kollaja reindeer owners association

the kollaja project would improve the efficiency of the power plants along the iijoki river and increase the balancing power capacity needed to balance out the
differences between the consumption and production of electricity the project would have major significance for the regional economy and employment in
north ostrobothnia furthermore it would provide protection from floods at pudasjärvi


overhaul of melo hydropower plant in kokemäenjoki completed
the overhaul of the melo hydropower plant located along the kokemäenjoki river was completed in november 2015 the twoyear overhaul project of both
generators boosted balancing power production and improved energyefficiency as well as extended the power plants operational life

pohjolan voima carries out preventive overhauls at its hydropower plants every 1520 years an extensive renovation project was carried out at the iijoki power
plants in 20052013 after the twoyear overhaul project of the melo power plant pohjolan voima will modernise its isohaara hydropower plant along the
kemijoki river


automation of isohaara hydropower plant to be modernised

the replacement of the backup boilers heavy fuel with light fuel oil which further reduced emissions and improved the plants energy efficiency and
operational reliability

the new boiler is used as a backup boiler in the generation of process steam for the laanila mill area in oulu as well as to provide additional district heating
capacity for the city of oulu the capacity of the backup boiler is 50 megawatts



      laanilan voimas preparation for the industrial emissions directive
      modifications that reduce emissions were implemented at the laanilan voima bioenergy power plant in the summer of 2015 during
      an extensive annual outage the modifications were also part of the companys preparations for the emission reductions required by
      the industrial emissions directive during the annual outage the power plants main boilers and their auxiliary systems were
      overhauled and a new additional field was installed in the electrostatic precipitator of the pyroflow boiler in addition one of the
      power plants 110 kv main unit transformers was replaced during the annual outage



kymin voimas new district heat exchanger increases district heat production volume
in 2015 kymin voima invested in a new district heat exchanger that allows the biopower plant to produce district heat for kss energia which is to be used in
kouvola and kuusankoski it also improved the district heat delivery reliability the increased district heat production capacity of the kymin voima biopower
plant reduces the emissions of the regions district heating systems as it replaces fossil natural gas with regional woodbased fuels and peat in the production
of district heat

capacity of the new district heat exchanger for the biopower plant located in the upm kymi mill area in kuusankoski is 75 mw it was commissioned in early
january 2016


rauman biovoimas recycled fuel system inaugurated
a reception and processing system for solid recycled fuels was inaugurated at the rauman biovoima power plant in rauma in may the system clearly improves
the utilisation of local recycled fuels up to 30 of the total fuel demand

mostly separately collected from industrial and commercial facilities the energy waste is used in a responsible manner that saves the environment as the fuel at
the power plant to generate heat and electricity for the upm rauma mill and district heat for the customers of rauman energia principal fuels of the biopower
plant are bark and other woodbased fuels


hämeenkyrön voima plans the use of recycled fuels
hämeenkyrön voima plans to increase the proportion of supplementary fuels at its bioenergy plant to ensure the continued competitiveness of its energy
production operations woodbased fuels will still remain the power plants main fuels

the highquality solid recycled fuel to be used as supplementary fuel will be manufactured from separately collected industrial and commercial waste as well as
from wood sourced from demolished buildings that cannot be reused but can still be used to produce energy

an environmental permit for the increase of recycled fuel has been obtained once the necessary equipment investments have been completed use of the new
supplementary fuel at the power plant should begin in the autumn of 2016



years of major investments will continue in nuclear power
tvo is preparing for the upcoming operating license renewal of ol1 and ol2 in 2018 by making plant modifications which will further improve the plant

operating environment
in 2015 electricity consumption in finland was 825 twh 833 twh in 2014 of this volume 662 654 twh was produced in finland while net imports
into finland amounted to 163 180 twh imported electricity covered 198 216 of finnish electricity consumption most of the imported electricity
came from sweden in 2015 power consumption in finland decreased by 11 from the previous year industrial power consumption decreased by 09 and
the power consumption of other sectors decreased by 10 lower from the previous year due to the exceptionally warm weather and the economic recession

nord pool spot trade amounted to 489 twh 501 twh the annual average system price was 2098 2961 per mwh while the annual average of the
finnish area price was 2966 3602 per mwh good water levels in the nordic countries decreasing fuel prices and increasing wind power production
lowered the electricity price in the nordic countries

eua emission allowance price remained despite the increasing trend throughout the year and varied between 642 and 865


pohjolan voimas heat and power production
in 2015 pohjolan voimas total electricity supply was 141 153 twh the groups own electricity production accounted for 133 146 twh of which the
parent companys supplies to its shareholders were 129 140 twh the subsidiaries supplied 04 05 twh to their other shareholders purchases from the
nordic electricity markets were 08 08 twh and sales amounted to 04 06 twh heat deliveries were 63 78 twh

nuclear power made up 574 546 of the electricity supply teollisuuden voimas olkiluoto nuclear power plant generated 143 148 twh of electricity
of which pohjolan voima obtained 81 84 twh in accordance with its shareholding the joint capacity factor of the olkiluoto plant units was 930
960

hydropower accounted for 23 17 twh or 163 114 of the electricity supply the hydropower production volume was the highest ever recorded due
to the excellent water year and the long spring floods

pohjolan voima produced 04 12 twh of condensing power which represented 28 78 of the electricity supply condensing power production clearly
decreased from the previous year because of the closing down of pvolämpövoima oys production operations and the low market prices the business of
pvolämpövoima is reported as a closed down function in the consolidated annual accounts

a total of 25 33 twh of electricity was generated by combined heat and power chp plants in addition to the low electricity prices the heat and power
generation volume of the chp plants was affected by the fact that three plants left pohjolan voima when pohjolan voima sold its subsidiaries keravan

accounting policies and critical estimations and assumptions

consolidation

subsidiaries

the consolidated financial statements include pohjolan voima oy and all its subsidiaries subsidiaries are those entities over which the group has control the
group has control overran entity if it has power over the entity it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the
ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns from the entity subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to
the group they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure
consistency with the policies adopted by the group

the group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations the consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is
the fair value of the assets transferred the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the group the consideration transferred includes the fair value
of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred identifiable assets acquired
and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date on an acquisitionby
acquisition basis the group recognises any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests proportionate share of
the acquirees net assets the excess of the consideration transferred the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisitiondate fair
value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill if
this is less than the fair value of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase the difference is recognised directly in the statement of
comprehensive income

intercompany transactions balances distributions of profit and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated unrealised losses
are also eliminated unless they relate to an impairment




 30                                                                                                                  pohjolan voima  annual report 2015

associated companies and joint arrangements

associates are all entities over which the group has significant influence but not control generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 of
the voting rights joint arrangements are either joint operations or joint ventures a joint venture is a contractual joint arrangement whereby the group
together with one or more parties has undertaken an economic activity that is subject to joint control and whereby the group with other parties has rights to
the net assets of the joint arrangement

investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost the groups share of
its associates and joint ventures postacquisition profits or losses is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and its share of postacquisition
movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income the cumulative postacquisition movements are adjusted against the
carrying amount of the investment the groups investment in associates and joint ventures includes goodwill identified at acquisition net of any accumulated
impairment losses when the groups share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture including
any other unsecured receivables the group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or
joint venture unrealised gains on transactions between the group and its associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the
associates or joint ventures unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred
accounting policies of associates and joint ventures have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group

transactions and noncontrolling interests

the profit or loss for the period attributable to owners of the parent and noncontrolling interest is disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income non
controlling interests are identified separately from the equity of the owners of the parent company in the statement of changes in equity

the group treats transactions with noncontrolling interests as transactions with equity owners of the group for purchases from noncontrolling interests the
difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity gains or
losses on disposals to noncontrolling interests are also recorded in equity

when the group ceases to have control or significant influence any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying
amount recognised in profit or loss the fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an
associate joint venture or financial asset in addition any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted
for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities this means that any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income
are recognized as part of the gain or loss on sale

foreign currency translation

the functional and presentation currency of the parent company and all of the subsidiaries associates and joint ventures is the euro foreign currency
transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet
foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at yearend exchange rates of monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except when deferred in other comprehensive
income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges foreign exchange gains and losses relating to operations are included on the
relevant line items above operating income foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the
statement of comprehensive income within finance income or cost translation differences on nonmonetary financial assets and liabilities held at cost are
translated using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions there are no nonmonetary financial assets or liabilities held at fair value
denominated in foreign currencies

revenue recognition

the groups energy operations are based on cost price sales of expert services relating to energy operations are not based on cost price revenues are based
on the consideration received for delivered energy or provided services all revenues are presented net of valueadded taxes revenues are recognised as
follows

energy revenues and other revenues

revenue for energy is recognised at the time of delivery revenue is recognised based on the delivered quantities service revenue mainly consists of
administration operating maintenance and network service revenues revenue for services is recognised in the financial period when services have been
rendered

other income

revenue from activities outside the normal operations is reported in other income this includes recurring items such as rental income and nonrecurring items
such as gains on sale of property plant and equipment rental income is recognised on a straightline basis over the period of the lease agreement the gain
on sale of property plant and equipment is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer




 31                                                                                                                 pohjolan voima  annual report 2015

research and development costs

research and development costs are expensed as incurred and included in other operating expenses except when the development costs are expected to
generate probable future economic benefits in this case the costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised over their useful lives there are no
development costs currently in the consolidated financial statements that fulfil the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset

interest income and dividends

interest income is recognised using the effective interest method dividends are recorded when the right to receive payment is established

borrowing costs

borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless they are directly attributable to construction of a power plant in
which case they are capitalized as a part of the cost of the asset

income taxes

pvo delivers electricity and heating to its shareholders at cost price the shareholders are delivered a proportionate share of the energy generated or procured
by pvo according to their proportionate ownership in the various series of shares based on the cost based pricing the group does not pay any taxes on its
energy related operations therefore the group does recognise any deferred tax assets or liabilities on these operations

income taxes and deferred taxes are recognised on the other hand on the services provided by the group

the tax expense for the period comprises current tax relating to the current period and any adjustments made to taxes for the previous financial period and
deferred taxes the current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted the taxes for the current period are adjusted if necessary by
the taxes related to the previous period

deferred income tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in the consolidated financial statements however deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in
a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss deferred tax liabilities
are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the undistributed profits of the subsidiaries if it is not probable that the
temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future the most significant temporary differences for the group arise from the depreciation of property
plant and equipment losses carried forward and the fair valuation of assets at acquisition

deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date deferred income tax assets are recognised only
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised

intangible assets

intangible assets are carried at historical cost less government grants received accumulated amortisation and impairment historical cost includes all costs
directly attributable to the acquisition of the intangible asset intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised using the straightline method over the
following estimated useful lives

computer software                      310 years
other intangible assets                510 years

no amortisation is recorded for goodwill and other intangible assets with infinite useful lives instead these assets are tested annually for impairment intangible
assets having infinite useful lives are water rights that have an infinite useful life based on the water act and certain utilisation rights for transmission roads and
land based on the act on the redemption of immoveable property and special rights

emission allowances

carbon dioxide co2 emission allowances are included in the intangible assets emission allowances are recognised at cost whether received free of charge or
acquired from a third party emission allowances received free of charge are in other words recorded at zero a short term liability is recognised to cover the
obligation to return emission allowances to the extent that group already holds allowances to meet the obligation the liability is measured at the carrying
amount of those allowances any shortfall of allowances held over the obligation is valued at the current market value of allowances emission right and the
related liability are derecognised when they are returned to cover the obligation or when they are sold emission allowances are not amortised the cost of the
provision is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income within materials and services gains from sales of emission rights are presented in other
income

property plant and equipment

property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less government grants received less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment
historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or
construction of assets that necessarily take a substantial amount of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the related
asset additionally the cost of an item of property plant and equipment includes the discounted estimated cost of its dismantlement removal or restoration


 32                                                                                                                   pohjolan voima  annual report 2015

land and water areas are not depreciated depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straightline
method to allocate their cost or revalued amounts to their residual values over their estimated useful lives the costs for dismantling a power plant are
depreciated over the estimated useful life of the specific power plant

depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based on the estimated useful
lives as follows

the assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate to reflect the changes in estimated future economic benefits associated
with the assets

if the asset consists of different components which have different estimated useful lives each component is recognised as a separate asset replaced
components are capitalized and any possible remaining carrying value of the replaced component is derecognised in other cases subsequent costs are
included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated
with the asset will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably

annual repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of comprehensive income during the financial period in which they are incurred power plant
modernization and improvements are recognised in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset as appropriate

gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other operating income or other
operating expenses in the statement of comprehensive income

depreciation on assets classified as held for sale according to ifrs 5 noncurrent assets held for sale and discontinued operations is ceased

government grants

grants from the government are recognised at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will comply
with all attached conditions government grants relating to the purchase of property plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset
and are recognised as income by reducing the depreciation charge of the asset they relate to government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised
in the statement of comprehensive income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate these grants are
presented in other operating income

inventories

inventories are stated at cost cost is determined using the firstin firstout fifo method the cost of inventory comprises raw materials and other direct costs
inventories are always stated at cost as the energy generation operations are conducted based on cost price and therefore the cost of inventory is always equal
to its net realizable value

leases

leases group as lessee

finance leasing

property plant and equipment leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred by the lessor to the group are
classified as finance leases finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present
value of the minimum lease payments the property plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of
the asset and the lease term the corresponding rental obligations net of finance charges are included in other current and noncurrent liabilities each lease
payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges the interest element of the finance cost is charged to the statement of comprehensive income
over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period

if a sale and leaseback transaction results in a finance lease any excess of sales proceeds over the carrying amount shall not be immediately recognised as
income by a sellerlessee instead it shall be deferred and amortised over the lease term if the leaseback is an operating lease and the lease payments and the
sale price are at fair value there has in effect been a normal sale transaction and any profit or loss is recognised immediately ias 39 is applied for the
collateralized financial liabilities that are resulted from sale and leaseback transactions that do not contain a lease in substance the liability is amortised at cost
each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges according to the effective interest method



 33                                                                                                                    pohjolan voima  annual report 2015

operating leases

leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases payments made under
operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straightline basis over the period of the lease

rental income from operating lease contracts where the group acts as the lessor are recorded in other operating income on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease

leases the group as lessor

leases of property plant and equipment where the group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee are classified as
finance leases the lease income is recorded as a receivable at its present value the interest element of the lease income is recorded to the comprehensive
statement of income over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the asset for each period

operating leases of property plant and equipment where the group acts as the lessor are included in the property plant and equipment in the balance sheet
these assets are in the same way as assets in groups own use depreciated over their useful life rental income is recorded on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease

arrangements containing a lease agreement

the group has entered into arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but conveys a right to use an asset in return for a payment of series of
payments and therefore contains a lease in order to determine if the arrangement includes a finance lease component or other lease agreement the criteria in
ifric 4 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease is used determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the
substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether
a fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets the asset and
b the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset
if the arrangement includes a lease ias 17 is applied to determine whether it is an operating or financial lease as described above other elements of the
arrangement are recognised according to the relevant standards

impairment of nonfinancial assets

the individual assets carrying values are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment if there is an indication of
impairment the asset is tested for impairment goodwill assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets in progress are not subject to
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment regardless of there is indication of impairment or not impairment for assets excluding goodwill is assessed
at the cashgenerating unit cgu level which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash
inflows from other assets or groups of assets goodwill is tested for impairment at the level at which it is monitored by management which may be an
individual cgu or groups of cgus but is not tested at a level higher than an operating segment

an assets recoverable amount is the higher of a cashgenerating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use value in use is the estimated discounted
future cash flows expected to be provided by the asset or group of assets the discount rates used are pretax and reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and specific risks relating to the relevant asset or group of assets

where the carrying value of an asset or cgu exceeds its recoverable amount the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount
impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income impairment arising from a goodwill impairment test is allocated first to
goodwill and any excess thereafter rateably over the other assets in the cgu assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment charge are reviewed for
possible reversal of the impairment if the estimates used in the calculation of the recoverable amount have changed a reversal of an impairment loss shall not
exceed the carrying amount net of amortisation or depreciation that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in
prior years impairment losses on goodwill are never reversed

financial assets and financial liabilities

purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the tradedate at fair value financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive
cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership

the group classifies its financial assets in the following categories financial assets at fair value through profit or loss loans and receivables and available for
sale financial assets the classification is determined at initial recognition and depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading or initially designated in this category derivatives are categorised as held
for trading unless they are designated as hedges all derivatives held by the group are classified as financial assets at fair value trough profit or loss as hedge
accounting is not applied by the group derivatives in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they
are classified as noncurrent when the derivatives have a negative value they are classified as financial liabilities held for trading liabilities in this category are
classified as current liabilities if expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are classified as noncurrent gains or losses arising from changes in
the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are presented in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in
which they arise

loans and receivables

loans and receivables are nonderivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and not held for sale the
groups loans and receivables comprise trade and loan receivables loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method they are included in current assets except for maturities greater than 12 months after the end of the reporting period these are classified as non
current assets trade receivables are recorded at cost which corresponds to their fair value loans granted which have a maturity date are measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest method loans lacking a maturity date are valued at cost

availableforsale financial assets

availableforsale financial assets are nonderivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories they are included
in noncurrent assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of the reporting period available
forsale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs and are subsequently valued at fair value unquoted securities for which fair
value cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost changes in the unrealized fair value of availableforsale financial assets are recognised in other
comprehensive income within the fair value reserve changes in fair value are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the asset is sold or
when it has been impaired the availableforsale financial assets held by the group comprise unquoted securities valued at cost there is no active market for

financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred in the statement of comprehensive income only if there is objective
evidence of impairment if in a subsequent period the fair value of an availableforsale financial asset increases the impairment loss of an equity instrument is
not reversed through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the group recognises an impairment of trade receivables if there is objective
evidence that the receivable will not be paid in full

financial liabilities

difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the period
of the borrowings using the effective interest method

be drawn down in this case the fee is deferred until the drawdown occurs to the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility
will be drawn down the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates

the notes to the financial statements tvo uses derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exchange rate risk in fuel purchases as well as the foreign
currency risk and interest rate risk in borrowings denominated in foreign currencies hedge accounting according to ias 39 is applied to foreign currency
forward contracts and cross currency swap contracts hedging foreign currency risk in procurement contracts of uranium in addition hedge accounting is
applied to some of the interest rate swap contracts entered into hedging the fluctuations in cash flows of interest payments on borrowings tvo documents

tvo applies both cash flow and fair value hedge accounting the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as
cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the revaluation reserve the gain or loss on the fair value of the hedge
instruments relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income within finance income and costs unless
they are capitalized as a part of an investment in a power plant changes in fair values accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods
when the hedged item affects profit or loss when a hedging instrument expires or is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting any cumulative gain or loss existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income and are recognised in profit or loss only when the forecasted
transaction is also recognised in profit or loss when a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in
equity is immediately recognised in the statement of comprehensive income

tvo applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on borrowings that are quoted the gain or loss relating to the effective portion of
interest derivatives hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the profit or loss within finance costs the carrying amount of hedged borrowings and fair
values of derivatives hedging them are considered part of interest bearing liabilities and assets if the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting
the adjustments to the carrying amount of a hedged borrowing is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity

tvo presents fair value changes relating to nonhedge accounted interest rate options and certain interest rate swaps within finance costs as regards those are
not capitalised in the cost of the power plant under construction

other companies in the group have derivative instruments that do not fulfil the hedge accounting criteria according to ias 39 examples of these instruments
are some interest rate swap agreements which have been used to exchange floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings and foreign currency forward
contracts hedging the foreign currency risk in fuel purchases derivatives are recorded at fair value in the assets or liabilities changes in the fair values of
foreign currency forwards and interest rate derivative instruments are recorded through profit and loss within finance income and costs derivatives are
classified as current or noncurrent assets or liabilities depending on their maturity date

market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation the increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as

implementation of interpretations and amendments to new and revised ifrs standards

in preparing these financial statements the group has followed the same accounting policies as in the annual financial statements for 2014 the adoption of
the following amendments to existing standards on 1 january 2015 has no impact on the consolidated financial statement

  annual improvements 20102012 and 20112013
  ifric 21 levies  interpretation of ias 37
  ias 19 amendment employee benefit  amendment regarding employee or third party contributions to defined benefit plans

the group will adopt the following standards interpretations and amendments to existing standards and interpretations published 2015 in its 2016 financial
statements or later based on initial assessment group estimates that these have no impact on the consolidated financial statements

  ifrs 9 financial instruments  replaces the multiple classification and measurement models in ias 39 with a single model that has three classification
   categories amortized cost fair value and fair value in the other comprehensive income
   classification of debt assets will be driven by the entitys business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of

   general rule it will be easier to apply hedge accounting going forward the new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes
   in presentation

   is based on expected credit losses ecl and it involves a threestage approach whereby financial assets move through the three stages as their credit
   quality changes the stage dictates how an entity measures impairment losses and applies the effective interest rate method a simplified approach is
   permitted for financial assets that do not have a significant financing component eg trade receivables on initial recognition entities will record a day1
   loss equal to the 12 month ecl or lifetime ecl for trade receivables unless the assets are considered credit impaired all new rules have to be applied for
   simultaneously
   the group is assessing the impact of the new standard on the consolidated financial statements
  ifrs 15 revenue from contracts with customers  new converged standard on revenue recognition it replaces ias 11 construction contracts and ias 18
   revenue and the related interpretations the new standard is based on the principle that revenue is recognized when control of a good or service transfers
   to a customer  so the notion of control replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards

assumptions

year end estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results and the detailed background information are followed by management together
with the business units using both internal and external sources of information changes to the estimates and assumptions are recognised in the financial
period in which changes occur and all the future financial periods

impairment testing

impairment testing is carried out annually for goodwill and for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives impairment testing for other assets is performed
when there is an indication that the asset might be impaired the recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on valueinuse
calculations these calculations are based on estimated future cash flows received from the use of the asset or the sale of the asset

pohjola voima operations are based on the cost price method mankala principle according to the articles of association the shareholders of the company
are invoiced a price for the energy received which covers all the expenses of the operations including depreciation and amortisation when testing if the assets
are impaired based on the valueinuse the discounted cash flows correspond except for a few exceptions to the recoverable amount and therefore usually
there is no impairment recorded

environmental provision

operations of the group are regulated by a number of laws and regulations the group is in compliance with all existing environmental regulations the group
has recorded for the industry customary provisions for environment protection expenses to cover its legal obligations

legal obligations

management judgement is required to estimate timing and valuation of the legal obligations a provision is recorded when the group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been
reliably estimated

board of directors the groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks liquidity risk market risk and credit risk

the objective of the financing function is to ensure the existence of sufficient funds for operative decision making and to promote the low cost of electricity
through its decisions

derivatives are entered into only for hedging purposes pohjolan voima does not apply hedge accounting under ifrs




liquidity and refinancing risks

liquidity and refinancing risks relate to the impact on the companys profit and loss and cash flows if the company is unable to secure sufficient funding for its
operations in addition to sufficient liquid funds and committed credit facilities pohjolan voima group seeks to reduce refinancing risk by diversifying the
maturity of its loans as well as sources for its funding

in accordance with pohjolan voima groups financing policy the maturity of longterm debt and refinancing is agreed so that a maximum of 25 of the
outstanding debt will fall due within the next 12 months this principle is not applied on the loans granted by the state nuclear waste management fund

liquidity risk is significantly reduced by the fact that pohjolan voima group invoices shareholders in accordance with the articles of association the monthly
fixed and variable costs

free liquidity is invested prudently and productively in instruments with a duration of up to 12 months the objective is to diversify investments and these are
chosen so that a secondary market liquidity is also ensured in adverse conditions and so that most of the investments can be realized at a low cost

pohjolan voima group mainly uses the domestic commercial paper programs in order to ensure shortterm financing

pohjolan voima groups liquidity is secured by the 23 june 2015 entered eur 300 million revolving credit facility which matures 23 june 2020 the credit
facility has two options to prolong the facility and it does not include covenants the loan facility was fully undrawn as per 31 december 2015 as well as per
31 december 2014

the following table presents a maturity analysis on loan agreements the figures are cash based and interest flows are based on the interest rates prevailing at
the closing date differences between the balance sheet items and the debt amounts below arise from the transaction costs that have been accrued according
to the effective interest method in the balance sheet transaction costs for loan arrangements are not included in the cash flows as these have been paid at the
time of the signing of the agreements

market risk

interest rate risk

changes in interest rates on the interestbearing receivables and liabilities create an interest rate risk the interest rate risk in the loan portfolio of the parent
company and subsidiaries is managed by changing the interest rate period and the duration the objective of the interest rate risk management in pohjolan
voima is to obtain the lowest possible interest expense and to reduce the volatility of interest expenses in accordance with the financing policy of the group
the duration of the loan portfolio of pohjolan voima is monitored separately for each series of shares the duration of the loan portfolios of the parent
company and subsidiaries are set at the level where the electricity price sensitivity to changes in interest rates is on an acceptable level considering the individual
riskbearing capacity of each series of shares

the interest rate period of loan portfolios in the parent company and subsidiaries may be changed with fixed rate loans interestrate swaps forward rate
agreements and interest rate cap and floor agreements subsidiaries interest rate hedges are made so that the counterparty is always the parent company the
parent company will then enter into a corresponding contract with a bank

currency risk

pohjolan voima group is exposed to foreign currency risk mainly due to fuel purchases both shortterm and longterm loans are mainly denominated in euros
other than the eurodenominated borrowings are hedged latest at the time when the loan is drawn

coal purchases are made almost entirely in us dollars because purchase agreements for coal are entered into up to 10 months in advance before delivery and
payment the euro versus dollar exchange rate changes will affect coal prices and thus also impact the price of electricity produced the weakening of the euro
leads to exchange losses and the strengthening of the euro leads to exchange gains

the changes in foreign exchange rates are hedged for the undelivered contracts pvo hedges only purchases that are based on signed contracts or that are
secured by derivative financial agreements consequently hedging is made on the date of the derivative contract or on the order date and it covers the period
to the expected payment date of the coal delivery hedging is reversed in line with the payment of delivery batches cost of hedging is allocated to the cost of
each batch of coal and therefore included in the production costs of each production facility if the terms of delivery of the coal batches are changed the
hedging will be changed in line with the change of the terms of delivery

currency swaps forward contracts and options can be used for the currency risk hedging

fair value estimation
carrying value of receivables and other receivables with variable interest rates are calculated using the effective interest method this is also a reasonable
estimate of their fair value shortterm trade and other receivables approximate their fair value as the effect of discounting is not significant for these
receivables due to their short maturities

availableforsale investments include investments in unlisted securities which are carried at acquisition cost because their fair values are not readily available
the group has no intention to dispose of these securities

carrying value of longterm loans and shortterm interestbearing liabilities is calculated using the effective interest method carrying value of loans with
variable interest rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value carrying value of shortterm interestbearing liabilities approximate their fair value as the effect
of discounting is not significant due to their short maturity fair value of loans with fixed interest rate is determined using a discounted cash flow method
discount rates used are the market interest rates at the closing date which were in between 02  10 00  08 

derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value at the closing date the fair values reflect the prices
which pvo would have to pay or would receive if it called a derivatives contract fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow
method using market rates prevailing at the closing date as the discount rate which were 02  10  00  08  fair values of forward foreign exchange
contracts and swaps are determined using quoted forward rates from contracts with similar duration pvo does not apply hedge accounting according to ias
39 so the changes in fair values for derivative instruments are recorded in the statment of comprehensive income

according to ifrs 7 items measured at fair value are classified into three different levels for the notes depending on how much the fair values are based on
market information fair values of instruments categorized as level 1 are based on quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical instruments fair
values of level 2 instruments are derived either directly or indirectly from quoted prices and level 3 of the fair values are determined using input data that is
not based on observable market data only derivative financial inatruments are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet and they are all in level 2 in the fair
value hierarchy
