                                building a culture of safety through 6s patrols
                         even when the manufacturing shop floor has been automated
         safety      products cannot be manufactured skillfully and with certainty without
                     work performed by many people this is precisely why the health and
                     safety of employees is the most important theme for the manufacturing
                     workplace at our kawagoe factory employees carry out 6s patrols to
   check for potential danger factors in their surroundings and make improvements as needed
   this is done under the health and safety committee which meets monthly the root factors
   in occupational accidents are relaxation of vigilance and disorder in details employees
   therefore go beyond checking just the dangerous workplace locations rather looking
   at every point of work procedure attire and other such areas and take steps to make
   improvements in fiscal 2012 we also began deploying safety patrols in every department
   because we decided it was necessary to carry out these measures in every department and
   workplace in accordance with their unique working characteristics
    6s safety plus five other terms all starting with s in japanese relating to orderliness cleanliness and discipline

                          feedback from health and safety committee promotion officer

                                 safety as the workplace climate and culture
                                        ultimately i think that the most important
                                   element of 6s is related to discipline meaning that
                                   discipline is established as a consistent pattern of                                                                                    it goes without saying that
                                   behavior the ideal is that everyone is able to put                                                                                     we will carry on with checks

                                   course without necessarily having to think about it                                                                                    of course and also examine

                                                    in 2014


                                                     what i want to communicate to the children

                                                        when i took on this challenge of a new title for children my aim was to create new value in the kids
                                                    market what i came up with was the story called hero bank with money as a main motif one reason
                                                    for choosing money this way was that children today have increasing opportunities to interact with money
                                                    even if indirectly due to the popularization of mobile terminals and other such devices in this era it is my
                                                    hope and desire to give children a feeling for how important money is
                                                        the main character in hero bank is an elementary school

                                                    his article of faith however and takes on a variety of problems in hero
                                                    battles out of the desire to help his friends and other people who are in

   manufacturing products you can enjoy with a sense of security

     sometimes a game will involve closeups just of certain particular aspects and it may then be subject
 to criticism from society as entertainment professionals however we need to address those concerns
 thoroughly and make it possible for customers to enjoy themselves for that purpose sega carries out
 stringent measures to manage product safety according to our own voluntary standards as well as
 industry guidelines the money that is a central motif of hero bank may appear on first sight to have
 some negative aspects however we have carried out careful research to determine what childrens
 parents and guardians feel concerned about in terms of influence on children and we pursue
 development with full care for not giving any cause for anxiety in this regard
     we also take care regarding violent expressions and the acceptability of language usage by
                                           characters while on the other hand we deliberately use terms
                                           that would be difficult for children such as contract or joint
                                           and several guarantor in order to make the children wonder in
                                           their simple way what this or the other word means so as to
                                           encourage discussion and communication between parents and
                                           children beyond that we have also included names that in
                                           japanese are homonyms or allusions to terms used in finance
                                           and we will be very happy if mothers and fathers can play hero

   what earns childrens longlasting interest and loyalty

                                                      we hope that hero bank will provide a way for children to feel
                                                  many things of importance such as how precious friends are and
                                                  about making a great effort for another person this is precisely why
                                                  we are marshaling all of the sega sammy group resources and

                                                  a game but a television anime manga trading cards toys and so on
                                                  by coordinating these one with the other we are positioning hero

                                                  interest and loyalty for a long time




inventive design elements in the hero bank arcade
    we developed the hero bank arcade using the essential knowhow sega has acquired in kids games and card games and put
it into operation throughout japan in july 2014 decks are made up from three hero cards and a set of three dice is thrown to play a
battle a player makes progress in the battle by the number of dots on the dice and there
have been some parents who said the game helps their childrens arithmetic studies
    the game machine has a printer with the latest technology built in and after a battle it
can print out a players favorite hero in card form a highquality card emerges in just 20
seconds not only that but the card is imprinted with the players name and record score
the children who have obtained these cards were very happy with them this technology
is also very popular with the shop operators with the previous kids card machines users
would purchase cards printed out for each version and when a version was upgraded the
previousversion cards had to be discarded that issue has been eliminated by the
adoption of this new internal printer which contributes both in terms of cost and in limiting
the amount of waste                                                                                 kazuya takahashi

   the planetarium we will be suggesting for use in everyday living spaces
      for a long time now it has not been possible to enjoy easily watching the stars in

rubble had become so covered                                   when it happened compared with                                 i think is to actually go to the
over by earth after all this time                             the time before the earthquake                                 affected area this gets exchanges
mixed in with the rubble were                                  the streets and houses seem quiet                               with local residents started

to the scene is to help keep the reality of what happened     group which makes fun things and interesting things           context you can ask what there is that you could help with

  changes are perceived and the measures needed for society and
  corporations to exist in harmony as well as for corporations to
  sustain growth and development the participants learned by                                                                             feedback from participants
  lectures and group work and they deepened their understanding                                                                          i would like to go from internal company training to internal group training
  and communication                                                                                                                      and have discussions that also include people from other companies
      at the end of training the participants all presented a csr                                                                        csr tends to strongly suggest social contributions and we were able to
  declaration for their own departments and they were given the                                                                          change that notion
  opportunity to rethink their raison detre as individual members                                                                        it turned out that csr is none other than company business
  of the sega sammy group we will continue this training in                                                                              the perspective of resolving social issues through the companys core
  the future so that every individual member will be aware of what                                                                        business was very instructive
  they should do in order for society to have expectations of this                                                                        i think it is extremely important for this company to think about resolving
  corporation and trust it and respect it and in order for their                                                                       social issues and about csr in terms of our core business
  group companies to be corporations they can take pride in it will                                                                      it was a great opportunity to establish communication going beyond our own
  enable them to think about this question and to act accordingly                                                                       divisions at the same time we gained an understanding of csr

                                                                i was privileged to act as an instructor for your group csr training a distinctive feature of the training was that it asked the
                                                            members of group company management to think deeply about the fundamental question of what csr is for the sega sammy
                                                            group through this essential question the participants were able to align the vectors of their conceptual approaches to csr
                                                            and at the same time they were able to talk to each other about their diverse values this yielded the major effect of diffusing
                                                            the group management philosophy throughout the attendees i expect that in the future good use will be made of this training

     delivering a truly enjoyable rpg for smartphones to our
     customers
         we want our customers to get full enjoyment of the fun of roleplaying
     games rpg even on versions made for smartphones where game sessions
     are shorter this was what started the chain chronicle development
     project there were three main points that we did not want to compromise on
     the first point was how we took the essence of the fun of an rpg which is
     doing battle in ways that follow the story line so that the setting for adventure
     grows broader and broader and we condensed it into about five minutes in
     this we made advantageous use of our knowhow in arcade games which
     have similarly short playing times the second point was the unique feeling
     of exhilaration that people get from playing on a smartphone where they
     use the touch panel the third point was the way players develop feelings of
     attachment to game characters that are friends rather than just cards and this
     happens when the game relates a story about characters that develop bonds
     with each other these three elements combined in a classic rpg in a way
     never before seen in smartphone games and we succeeded in pleasing large                                  jun matsunaga
     numbers of customers with it we are planning on further heightening the fun
                                                                                                                mobile works team rd div 1

         staff comment         it is important for manufacturing to stay in clear focus so you can
                               confidently say the product is fun
           what we do is keep our thinking focused on what kind of play would be fun to have and what kind
       of machine would really be enjoyable then we go into development to figure out how to express that in
       the pachislot framework without compromising anything during planning my head is always filled with
       ideas about various play scenarios and i simulate things to figure out what is enjoyable about some
       certain aspect and what is fun about some element when i have it pinned down to some particular
       point then we add sounds and other production values that will dramatically heighten enjoyment of the
       excitement factor which you could express as what feels good to the brain sometimes we strip away
       everything superfluous and arrange it to be simple or take other such steps to maintain a balance and
       variety of pacing at the same time however we place importance on manufacturing a product with a
       focus that never diverges from the basic thrust of what we planned i hope that i can keep on meeting
       our customers expectations by creating new ways to play that will astonish everyone and beyond
       that i hope to contribute to stimulation of the market and growth of the industry as well

        sega sega networks and sammy networks provide content for smartphones and tablet mobile terminals and in light of the
   problems of excessive game use by minors and associated charges we have instituted age authentication for certain titles that places
   limits on the monthly charges that can be accumulated for them in connection with the game gacha in which players use points
   and other items that we sell for a price we are also making every effort to keep players from having excessive expectations due to
   ambiguous statements as well as from consequently accumulating excessive charges we have for example established inhouse
   guidelines for clear statement of the reality of items that players can acquire or of the probability of their acquisition item by item
   we intend to continue our efforts not only by measures like these but also by compliance with laws and regulations and in terms of
   consumer protection so as to create a healthy environment for game playing where users can enjoy themselves with a sense of security

     operating the machines we also installed models with basic play free of charge in the front of centers in
     an effort to get people who usually do not play amusement games to give them a try unreservedly and
     discover the unique fun of amusement centers the thing that is important when proposing measures is
     to have a firm grasp of the situation in each center and to put our accumulated knowhow into practice
     in the most suitable way going forward we will keep amassing proposals and experience aiming to
     be trusted and depended on by businesses that operate amusement centers which are our important

                           expectations for the growth and active participation of new employees
         being involved in the monthlong training for new employees has been highly stimulating
     the training was divided into three major phases mindset change going from a student to a
     working adult acquisition of abilities and skills and enhancement of the ability to get things
     done what impressed me in particular was the shop training in amusement centers the aim
     of this training is to go beyond the mere acquisition of knowledge and to enhance ones ability
     to get things done by putting what one has learned thus far into practice in a shop on the final
     day there were people who were so glad to have had the training that they were overcome with
     emotion it seems that all kinds of feelings welled up in them when face to face with customers
     they realized their own immaturity and felt the importance of gaining
     real experience personally i felt the achievement that what i had been
     teaching got across going forward i want to continue increasing the
     level of our educational measures and create environments in which
     individuals and organizations can grow together

                                     the number of women working on the front lines has increased including at sega toys when i look
                                back to the time i joined the company there were few female managers and i remember worrying about
                                trivial matters with no one to consult from this april the roles and expectations i am expected to fulfill
                                have mounted and i feel the pressure however i am determined to turn that pressure into energy and
                                to achieve results while enjoying my work on the front i hope to contribute to the companys growth by
                                showing that kind of attitude of continually embracing challenges to my juniors
                                     i also hope to serve as a bridge between the management team and female employees in the trenches
                                so as to support the creation of an environment where female employees can play even more active roles

    which was conducted by nichidenkyo and kaidouyusho cooperative2 in 2013 the growing numbers of people with dementia has
    become a major problem in japan where the population is aging given this situation nichidenkyo and kaidouyusho cooperative
    asked professor kikunori shinohara of tokyo university of science suwa an expert in brain science and health science to conduct
    a demonstration study on the potential of pachislot playing in the field of brain activity the results showed that pachislot training
    stimulated brain activity in subjects aged 50 and older and contributes to prevention and improvement of cognitive function decline


             stakeholder comment

                                           looking forward to the creation of new value
                                               it had already been recognized that playing pachislot stimulated brain function in the youngadult segment the main
                                           purpose of this new study was to ascertain brain stimulation attributable to pachislot playing in people aged 50 and older
                                           which is when cognitive function begins to fall the results showed activation of the parietal lobe and left frontal lobe which
                                           are involved in spatial cognition one month of using a pachislot machine showed the effect of increasing cognitive function
                                           research conducted at harvard university in the us has suggested that play and leisure rank alongside exercise and nutrition in
                                           helping prevent decline in cognitive function i look forward to the time when game halls go beyond places for play and become
                                           places that also provide health service to senior citizens

connected to the support of the heart that is necessary for                 issue for the effective execution of csr management this is
humans to live with dignity food clothing and shelter are                so because continual improvements based on the pdca cycle
problems that must be solved first during rehabilitation and                cannot be expected without the establishment of assessable

mental trauma is another important issue the fact is however             results issues are described qualitatively making it difficult to
