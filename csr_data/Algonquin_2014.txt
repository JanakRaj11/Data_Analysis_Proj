requirements when it comes to environmental management our
goal is to ensure that we comply with all environmental
regulations which is an extension of our local responsive and

our future depends on our current reputation


next to our people the quality of our relationship with communities
across north america is our most important asset and competitive
advantage we embrace our environmental responsibility through

wherever we operate here are a few examples of our biodiversity
approach and what we do to mitigate the impact our operations
could have on the environment


cornwall solar project
this solar project is located in an abandoned quarry near cornwall
ontario an environmental assessment in compliance with ontario
regulations and according to the provincial renewable energy
approval and endangered species act identified the bobolink bird
and butternut tree as atrisk species we partnered with ducks
unlimited canada and raison region conservation authority to
provide mitigation programs for these species a partnership with
eastern ontario model forest is also in effect to replace forestry
habitat both programs are funded by the company and are

red lily wind energy project
following construction of the red lily wind project in
southeastern saskatchewan we conducted a twoyear monitoring
program for birds and bats as proposed to the provincial ministry
of environment during the environmental impact assessment
process the results showed bird and bat mortality rates at red
lily are comparable to those at other wind farms within
saskatchewan and throughout north america we also voluntarily
undertook a preconstruction and postconstruction sound
assessment this assessment report and the data collected found
no serious impact regarding sound related to the red lily project

our carbon footprint




we have voluntarily reported to the carbon disclosure project cdp
since 2008 our total carbon footprint fluctuates significantly on an
annual basis this is due to many factors including our aggressive
utility acquisition strategy our continued transition towards renewable
energy projects in our power generation portfolio and organic
changes in operational practices at our thermal generation facilities

we also provide benchmarks that reflect ghg emissions within the
context of our growing asset base and revenues our intensity
based ghg emissions per  revenue have decreased steadily over
the past three years

solar rooftops for our buildings
in 2012 our regulated utility distribution group installed solar
panels on some of the water reservoir rooftops in arizona the
benefits are positive lower utility costs reduced electric load on
the local grid positive customer response and a reduction to our
overall carbon footprint we plan to expand the solar rooftops
program to include more companyowned facilities



fleet conversions to compressed natural gas and
electric power
our fleet operations represent a major sustainability opportunity
for our business by converting to lower or zero emissions
vehicles we reduce environmental and financial costs associated
with transportation

we have a fleet of 550 heavy and light duty vehicles and a
growing infrastructure of customer service locations across many
states vehicle testing is underway to convert to both natural gas
and electric power we pilot tested several vehicle types from
100 electric to dual fuel in both passenger vehicles and light
duty trucks

savings options

energy audits and rebates
our distribution group offers customer incentives to invest in energy
efficiency through audits and technical assessments financing and
rebate programs these programs include compact fluorescent and
led bulbs energy efficient appliances controls heating water
heating and cooling systems and weatherization measures among
others since our vision is to be the most admired utility by our
customers and regulators we aim to go above and beyond what is
required to deliver these programs

the total energy saved in these programs is equivalent to over
174000 mmbtus or the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions from
2632 passenger vehicles


2012 highlights
