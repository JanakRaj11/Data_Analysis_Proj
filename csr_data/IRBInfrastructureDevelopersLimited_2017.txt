untiring efforts and unwavering focus on


accelerating value creation
through focus on bots
roads connecting remote areas and accounting for nearly 65 of freight
movement are in many ways the lifeline of indias socioeconomic development
at irb our robust balance sheet strength past track record and execution expertise enable us to get prequalified to bid for
entire gamut of road development projects however we focus only on bot projects that have the advantage of generating
higher rate of return and are marked with low competition with very few players possessing necessary competencies to un
dertake large size and complex projects besides bot projects facilitate us in building a pipeline of income generating assets
which post stabilisation can be offered to invits which enables us to realise value of investments which can be reinvested into
new projects

untiring efforts and unwavering focus on


superior execution
capabilities
in road construction business involving capital intensive projects the faster the
execution of projects and better the control over resources better are the rate of
returns

at irb our superior integrated execution capabilities play a crucial role in our robust growth while on one hand the timely
delivery of projects and quality of work significantly enhanced our brand equity on the other it enabled us to maintain higher
internal rate of return through preventing costs overruns driven by project delays thus providing us faster access to revenues
from toll operations enabling us to breakeven operations earlier this in turn enables us to meet debt obligations and the
resultant improvement in credit rating

pioneering indias
first invit
just when people began to think that infrastructure
companies could not possibly grow organically
without further leveraging their balance sheets and
diluting shareholders interest we launched the
countrys first infrastructure investment trust
a gamechanging initiative our transfer of 6 projects to the irb invit fund not
only reduced our leverage but provided immediate access to investible cash flow
that can be reinvested in new projects besides being a source of regular cash
flows the trust has a potential to act as a vehicle to which operational assets can
be offered for unlocking tiedup capital




     what are invits                                                  why invits
     invits infrastructure investment trust are trusts               facilitate infrastructure developers to monetise
     that manage income generating infrastructure                       assets for reinvestments in new projects
     assets while offering individual investors a liquid              investment in diversified portfolio of
     method of directly investing in these assets by                    infrastructure assets reduces risks
     pooling sums of money investors are issued units                 attracts foreign capital into infrastructure sector
     against which they are typically offered regular                  facilitates banks to reduce burden by freeingup
     yields with potential for future growth it is a kind of           capital and reducing loan exposure which in turn
     fundraising mechanism leveraged by infrastructure                 can be utilised for funding new requirements
     developers as an investment vehicle to monetise                   facilitate higher standards of governance and
     their infrastructure assets                                       transparency into infrastructure development
                                                                        and management and distribution of income from

from settlement of noncurrent nonmonetory items in relation to acquisition of depreciable assets and required recognise the same

for accounting for exchange differences arising from translation of noncurrent foreign currency monetary items recognised in the
previous gaap financial statements for the period ending immediately before the beginning of the first lnd as financial reporting
period however for any new noncurrent foreign currency monetary item recognized from the first lnd as financial reporting
period the group will follow ind as 21 for recognition of gain and losses

the management assessed that cash and cash equivalents trade receivables trade payables bank overdrafts and other current
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments
the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale
the discount for lack of marketability represents the amounts that the group has determined that market participants would take
into account when pricing the investments
note 44  fair value hierarchy
all financial instruments for which fair value is recognised or disclosed are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as
follows based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole
level 1 quoted unadjusted price is active market for identical assets or liabilities
level 2 valuation technique for which the lowest level input that has a significant effect on the fair value measurement are observed
either directly or indirectly
level 3 valuation technique for which the lowest level input has a significant effect on the fair value measurement is not based on
observable market data

note 53  significant accounting judgement estimates and assumptions
the preparation of the groups financial statements requires management to make judgements estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenue expenses assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures and the disclosure
of contingent liabilities uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material
adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future years
estimates and assumptions
estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the
year in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected
the group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared existing
circumstances and assumptions about future developments however may change due to market changes or circumstances arising
that are beyond the control of the group such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur
taxes
there are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded such
differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the tax determination is made the assessment
of probability involves estimation of a number of factors including future taxable income

prices market risk comprises three types of risk interest rate risk currency risk and other price risk such as equity price risk and
commodity risk financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings deposits and fvtoci investments
credit risk on financial assets
credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract leading to a
financial loss the company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities primarily trade receivables and from its financing
activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments
financial instruments and cash deposits
credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the companys top management in accordance with
the companys policy investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned
to each counterparty counterparty credit limits are reviewed by the top management on an annual basis and may be updated
throughout the year subject to approval of the companys board of directors the limits are set to minimise the concentration of
risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through counterpartys potential failure to make payments
interest rate risk
interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in
market interest rates the companys exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the companys

borrowings affected after excluding the credit exposure for which interest rate swap has been taken and hence the interest rate
is fixed with all other variables held constant the companys profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate
borrowings as follows

fair value measurement of financial instruments
when the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted
prices in active markets their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the dcf model the inputs to these models
are taken from observable markets where possible but where this is not feasible a degree of judgement is required in establishing
fair values judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk credit risk and volatility changes in assumptions about
these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments see note 32 and 33 for further disclosures
taxes
there are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax
determination is uncertain where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts initially recorded such
differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which the tax determination is made the assessment
of probability involves estimation of a number of factors including future taxable income
defined benefit plans gratuity benefits
a liability in respect of defined benefit plans is recognised in the balance sheet and is measured as the present value of the defined
benefit obligation at the reporting date the present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments at
the reporting date calculated annually by independent actuaries consideration is given to expected future salary levels experience
of employee departures and periods of service refer note 27 for details of the key assumptions used in determining the accounting
for these plans
