      capital allocation
      we aim to increase our exposure to developments in europe and
      emerging markets this will be achieved through a combination
      of acquiring exposure to new development opportunities and
      reducing our exposure to investment properties we will also shift
      from a shopping centre focus to exploring urban regeneration
      and mixeduse development opportunities that are retailcentred
      we will reduce the financial capital invested over the long term
      through our capital light strategy and investors will be invited to
      share the risk and return

      portuguese assets fuelled by the sale of torre ocidente we saw
      yields compress by 85 basis points for prime assets and between

      this movement taking place during the second half of the year
      in spain yields compressed by between 14 and 52 basis points
      excluding plaza mayor where the sale of part of the leisure centre
      to the joint venture partnership which will develop the designer
      outlet meant the yield for the remaining asset compressed by
      313 basis points we obtained licenses to convert the remaining
      part of the leisure centre to retail and installed media markt as an

      profit  loss accounts
      sonae sierra recorded a net profit of 1417 million in 2015 which compares with 963 million in the same period of 2014 an increase
      of 47
      in 2015 direct net profit reached 61 million which represents a 16 increase compared to last year the direct net profit was driven
      by a combination of improved operational results the growth of our professional services and lower interest rates on a likeforlike
      portfolio basis and excluding the impact of adverse fx changes direct net profit increased by 22 as a consequence of the quality of
      our assets and management approach
      indirect net profit reached 807 million compared to 436 million in the same period of 2014 the positive variation in indirect net
      profit was mainly a consequence of the yield compression in portugal which accounts for 75 of the value created and the
      improvement in the operational performance of our iberian and brazilian assets despite the yield expansion in brazil

      balance sheet
      the total assets of the company reached 23 billion of which 2 billion correspond to investment properties and 120 million are
      properties under development
      the increase on the investment properties value was more than compensated for by the adverse effect of the yearend exchange
      rate of the brazilian real and the disposal of torre ocidente and zubiarte
      properties under development doubled in line with the companys strategy on focusing on new opportunities which are mainly explained
      by investments in parklake nuremberg zenata cúcuta and the norteshopping expansion
      bank loans decreased compared to 31 december 2014 mainly due to contractual loan amortisations and the disposals of the assets
      explained above

      sonae sierra brasil
      sonae sierra brasil contributed 145 million to the consolidated net profit of sonae sierra a decrease of 45 when compared to 2014
      due to an adverse change in the exchange rate of 12 in average terms
      the ebit decrease is explained by the depreciation of the brazilian real excluding the impact of the adverse fx change ebit increased
      by 5 which is mainly explained by higher rental income as a consequence of the quality of our assets and management approach
      value created in investment properties reflects the positive impact from operational cash flows although yields expanded due to the
      challenging macroeconomic environment
      investment properties reached 331 million in december 2015 a decrease of 92 million when compared to 31 december 2014 which
      is explained by the depreciation of the brazilian real end of year rate although there was an increase in the value of operating assets

      the above table identifies the material boundaries for each aspect broadly spilt between impacts under our direct operational control those related
      to professional services and those related to the activities of our suppliers and tenants for specific limitations regarding the boundary and level of
      coverage for each of the above aspects see g423 the relevant disclosure on management approach for each material aspect and data qualifying
      notes for individual indicators

      we have not provided a further analysis of material boundaries according to geographyregion as the aspects that fall under our direct control relate
      to our operations that are located in countriesregions which typically share many legal social and environmental characteristics meaning there are
      no dramatic differences in the materiality of each aspect the exception as noted above is emerging markets where we provide third party services
      which fall outside the scope of this report unless otherwise stated furthermore we apply a consistent approach to managing these impacts across
      owned shopping centres where differences do occur for example in relation to the localised impacts of climate change and water availability these
      are often felt at an individual asset level and not at a broader country or regional level in these instances our management approach allows for a
      more tailored approach see g4ec2 and the dma for water

      g4ec2        financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisations activities due to climate change

      the impacts of climate change in the form of extreme weather events  flooding heat waves weathering subsidence etc could cause physical and
      local depreciation to assets and those with unreliable energy supplies could also depreciate faster than others on the other hand adapting existing
      buildings and developing and acquiring new buildings which perform better in predicted climate change scenarios could help to maintain and
      enhance asset and portfolio value in the long term
      in 2009 we commissioned a study to investigate the financial risks associated with climate change on a sample of our portuguese assets focusing
      on three components energy mainly electricity water and insurance costs the results revealed that
       the increased demand for energy and the anticipated increase in the price of energy is expected to reduce profitability by a maximum of between
        2 and 5 in 2030 and between 3 and 6 in 2050 with variations between different shopping centres
       in the case of water it was not possible to estimate the potential increase in demand due to climate change but the impact of increases in water
        costs was examined with the conclusion that these could reduce profitability by between 015 and 2
       the likely increase in insurance costs was estimated at 21 this could affect profitability between 01 and 07
      in portugal algarveshopping and norteshopping were selected for a more detailed assetlevel study the results of the study revealed that
       increased demand for energy due to higher temperatures combined with projected price increases are likely to impact on operational shopping
        centres profitability in the long term for example at norteshopping an estimated reduction of profits between 2 and 57 could occur in 2030
       water costs are also expected to rise but estimates vary significantly and the impact on profitability would be less significant for example
        between 005 and 014 at norteshopping and slightly more at algarveshopping due to higher water costs in this region
       insurance costs are likely to increase by around 21 due to the increased frequency of extreme weather events and other risks associated with
        climate change the impact on profitability is likely to be around 01 at norteshopping and 07 at algarveshopping
      in 2013 we commissioned a highlevel review building on the 2009 study to explore the business case for climate change adaptation it reviewed
      the following key business drivers as a consequence of climate change physical damage to property assets evidence of climate change risks
      affecting operational and asset value based on sonae sierra management acquisition and disposal activities evidence of climate change risks

      the findings highlighted that the strongest driver related to climate change adaptation relates to the possible transfer of risks usually absorbed by
      the public sector to the insurance industry or directly to the private sector other drivers include physical damage to sonae sierra assets from
      extreme weather related events conversely there was no evidence that climate change risks have had an impact on disposal activities for sonae
      sierra but there is increasing awareness amongst valuers at present there is a limited business case for adaptation measures based on legislative
      and policy drivers as there are no plans for introducing legally binding directives requiring property companies to adapt to climate change and it is
      unclear how the costs of planning for climate change adaptation at a national level will be absorbed
      at an operational level insurance premiums for sonae sierra assets are unlikely to be immediately affected however if insurance products were to
      become unavailable in the future due to an increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events this would impose a significant
      burden on the state if this scenario were to happen then the private sector may need to absorb the costs directly and the risks to asset and
      operational value would substantially increase
      in the context of this study sonae sierra has pursued a number of soft adaptation measures which do not require large levels of capital investment
      these include
       integrating climate change adaptation into the risk management process of our business activities through the risk management working group
       maintaining a register of relevant climate change adaptation policies in all countries of operation
       updating our acquisition checklist to ensure key risks related to weather related events are evaluated
       updating our building standards based on lessons learnt from weather damaged assets and to anticipate potential requirements for hard
        adaptation measures in the future
       monitoring of the impact of climate change risks on insurance premiums and asset values
      furthermore we will continue to review the relative materiality of other environmental impact areas in terms of the risk and opportunity they might
      present to the business as part of our risk management working group we use a standard risk management framework to evaluate environmental
      issues according to the likelihoodfrequency of occurrence and the scale of impact should they arise as well as energy and climate change other
      potential risks and opportunities include water and waste pages 87 to 90 and 96 to 98 the issues identified are addressed through the resource
      resilience and safe people and ecoefficiency focus areas which form part of our sustainability strategy

           during the development of our sustainability strategy we identified several instances where our company has an indirect economic impact
           on our stakeholders and the communities where we operate these include job creation and skills development opportunities the impact on
           local businesses including suppliers from our activities and the impact on our tenants businesses
           while it is difficult for us to measure the significance of these indirect economic impacts in the context of external benchmarks and
           stakeholder priorities the feedback we have received from tenants and local community members has further highlighted to us the
           importance of these issues to some key stakeholder groups
           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

           during the development and operation of our shopping centres we carry out feasibility studies to identify consumers needs in retail
           services and leisure activities in order to design and adapt shopping centres to match market needs and enhance the existing retail offer
           these studies consider factors such as demographics within the catchment area and socioeconomic indicators and constitute a form of
           community needs assessment for our business activity these factors are also tracked through our geo tracking surveys that provide

               in 2015 sonae sierra invested more than 15 million in environmental initiatives equivalent to 25 of direct net profit environmental aspects are
               clearly important to sonae sierra and to the companys stakeholders this is demonstrated through the materiality review performed by sonae
               sierra in 2015 which highlighted aspects such as water energy waste and emissions as the top four most material issues to sonae sierras

               our she policy commits us to promoting she training among our employees tenants and service suppliers within the framework of our
               shems we operate a competence training and awareness procedure in accordance with this procedure the sustainability office uses a
               competence matrix to define the skills and knowledge required for each aspect of the shems to be effectively implemented by sonae
               sierras employees according to their role and function general training needs are also identified by the sustainability office with support
               from the country she coordinator

               all new sonae sierra employees must receive she induction training and all site managers site correspondents and country she coordinators
               must attend training on all she procedures within our shems as well as on legal issues specific to the country where they coordinate she
               management we collaborate closely with our critical suppliers on specific issues relating to she through our shems procedures

               site training and awareness plans are also developed based on the corporate plan and cover initial and continuous training and awareness for
               personnel such as new employees service suppliers workers and tenants a survey is performed following each training session allowing us to
               monitor the effectiveness of training delivered in 2015 we delivered a total of 27020 man hours of training including meetings on she to
               staff suppliers and tenants across our shopping centres development projects and in our corporate offices

           regular she meetings with our security maintenance cleaning and waste suppliers discuss common environmental issues and highlight
           basic housekeeping procedures that help to reduce our environmental impact such as waste disposal and recycling a good practice guide
           for tenant and service suppliers sets our best practice guidelines covering various activities to reduce the risk of safety accidents and
           environmental incidents

           specific actions  resource resilience
           resource resilience is one of five long term priorities that underpin our sustainability strategy a resource resilience working group was
           established in 2013 to investigate potential lines of action focusing on alternative energy and water supply strategies the working group
           identified three potential lines of action including onsite renewable energy generation converting tenant waste to energy and the rollout of
           water recycling and reuse systems at the time converting tenant waste to energy with the possible exception of parque d pedro shopping
           in brazil and onsite renewable energy were not deemed economically viable we did however proceed with the roll out of water reuse and
           rainwater harvesting systems and a number of actions designed to improve water efficiency and reduce water consumption were
           incorporated into our sheds and shems

           following this initial work responsibility for monitoring the future viability of onsite energy generation and waste to energy solutions moved
           to the sustainability office

           our shems includes a report performance measurement and monitoring procedure to monitor evaluate and report she performance on a
           regular basis a series of tools and applications exist to assist the monitoring and reporting tasks such as the she portal performance
           results are reported on a timely basis to the sustainability steering committee executive committee and board of directors shems
           implementation results are evaluated annually as part of our management review process to ensure continuous improvement

           we have established an incident report and investigation procedure to report investigate communicate and act to prevent she incidents
           its main purpose is to implement corrective and preventive measures that are effective in avoiding similar situations that can lead to further
           accidents relevant importance is given to the communication of incidents their investigation the determination of their root cause the
           definition of proper corrective and preventive measures and also the communication of learning points throughout the organisation

           the majority of incidents recorded under this procedure cover safety and health incidents please see occupational health and safety
           pages 102 to 109 and customer health and safety pages 127 to 130 for more information on our performance in these areas

           we also have a nonconformities preventive and corrective actions procedure in place to

            identify and record actual and potential nonconformities

            implement correction measures to minimise their consequences

            analyse nonconformity causes

            define corrective or preventive actions and review their effectiveness

           we operate an annual audit programme to systematically audit our shems at corporate and at site levels covering all our shopping centres

              resulting from the implementation of our safety health and environmental management system excluding sh issues the model allows
              sonae sierra to break down expenditures by legally mandatory socalled baseline expenditures and extrabaseline expenditures eg legionella
              monitoring in countries where no legal requirements exist in this way it is possible to estimate the economic effort of the company to strive
              to achieve more than just complying with legal requirements the ea is structured by environmental domain and specific activities and the
              presented figures include all shopping centres owned by sonae sierra in operation for the current reporting

              capital expenditure and current costs are calculated from the companys financial controlling frameworks classifying them by assigning one or
              several environmental activities along with its related percentages and legally non mandatory fractions current costs include the human resource
              effort that is environmentally related and corporate environmental expenditure

              benefits of the period can be physical or economic and are computed as differences in performance between 2015 and 2014 they are based on
              validated data also presented throughout this report economic benefits can be revenues monetary inflows from environmental conservation
              activities for example from waste recycling or savings avoided consumptions pollutants disposal or costs compared with the previous period

           efficiency of resources use and have an associated quantifiable environmental physical benefit andor economic saving when compared
           with basic technology or prior existing situations these actions produce effects throughout the assetequipments operating period
           the effects of actions from previous years and those implemented throughout this period are shown in the table the implementation date
           of the significant actions is assumed to be 31 october meaning that the benefits physical and economic for a full year are six times larger
           than the shown figures the benefits of significant actions from previous periods are likely to be underestimated since data started to be
           regularly reported in 2010 and data reported prior to 2011 was not exhaustively checked or validated nevertheless over the years the
           contribution of the unreported significant actions from the past will tend to decrease

      aspect      materials
      disclosures on management approach
      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           although the sourcing of materials used in shopping centre development and operations is controlled by our contractors we are aware that
           our business activity does entail a significant impact in terms of the extraction of raw materials including timber stone and metals
           principally through the use of semimanufactured goods and parts which are derived from raw materials whilst the extraction of raw
           materials adversely impacts on the natural environment the reuse of existing materials for example from demolition waste and the use of
           manufactured goods fabricated from recycled materials can help to promote a more sustainable closed loop approach to waste management
           and materials use

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 60 to 63 above

      b   report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
           policies and commitments
           we engage with our suppliers with the aim of encouraging them to adopt more responsible business practices our responsible procurement
           policy commits us to among other things privileging the use of materials which are locallysourced have recycled content have lowtoxic
           content have a long life and can be recycled or reused andor are sourced from companies which adhere to ethical andor environmental
           standards

           direct use
           for sonae sierra it is difficult to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects as our development
           contractors source materials generally premanufactured goods on our behalf this compromises our ability to gauge a clear understanding
           of the scale of our impacts in terms of raw material consumption nonetheless our safety health and environment development standards
           sheds prohibit the use of materials which are known to have negative impacts on the environment and on the health and wellbeing of
           building occupants and timber products derived from nonsustainable forestry during construction our shems ensures that efforts to
           reduce material use and waste are considered and whenever possible we reuse materials on site reducing the need for raw materials

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices for selecting materials and engaging suppliers including
           specifications for certifications or utilisation of preferred or prescribed lists of products and materials
           as noted above it is difficult for sonae sierra to control the selection of raw materials used in shopping centre development projects in 2012
           we conducted a study to quantify the recycled content of the most significant materials consumed during the construction of new projects
           including concrete brickwork steel glass and insulation the aim was to help us to identify which materials we might prioritise when seeking
           more sustainable alternatives the defined methodology is being applied to the construction of parklake in romania which is estimated to
           be completed in 2016

      disclosures on management approach
      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           according to the international energy agency iea the built environment is responsible for around 40 of the worlds total primary energy
           consumption and 24 of carbon dioxide co² emissions as pressure on governments to reduce the potential impacts of global climate
           change grows regulations on the energy consumption and ghg emissions of buildings are becoming more stringent consequently high
           energy consuming and carbonemitting buildings are likely to become less attractive to investors and occupiers in the future on the
           contrary more ecoefficient lowcarbon assets which generate their own energy onsite from renewable sources are likely to sustain their
           value in the long term

           for sonae sierra energy includes both energy consumption and energy security we have developed a dual strategy to reduce our reliance
           on volatile fossilfuel derived energy markets by improving the energy efficiency of our operations and implementing measures to increase
           our selfsufficiency in relation to energy use

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number

           with respect to our focus on resource resilience we have set a long term objective to increase our resilience with regards to natural
           resources specifically we are monitoring opportunities to generate renewable energy on our sites to remove our reliance on fossil fuel based
           energy purchased from suppliers

          and performance criteria covering hvac equipment and common area lighting as well as recommendations for energy efficient tenant
          lighting we also require development managers to explore possible renewable and lowcarbon technologies during design such as passive
          solar design or natural ventilation

          we are especially committed to designing buildings that will achieve high energy efficiency ratings under the european unions energy
          performance of buildings directive since 2013 we have also aimed for all our own new development projects major expansions and

          contractors strictly adhere to our shems which includes guidelines for monitoring energy consumption and achieving greater energy
          efficiency

          during the operations phase we ensure shopping centres are run as efficiently as possible see safety health and environment
          management system on page 49 since 2013 we have rolled out an energy modelling tool bright project which enables us to calculate the
          optimised theoretical energy consumption of a shopping centre and then compare this with its actual usage making it possible to easily
          detect and remedy any inefficiency the methodology allows us to adjust targets for each shopping centre which together with more reliable

      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           as demand for fresh water becomes ever greater around the world due to population growth urbanisation increased economic activity and
           climate change we need to ensure we have adequate supplies for all our shopping centres particularly those in areas that are vulnerable to
           shortages such as portugal brazil greece and spain

           for sonae sierra water includes both water consumption and water scarcity we have developed a dual strategy to reduce our reliance on
           the availability of fresh water supplies by focusing on improving the water efficiency of our portfolio and using innovation and technology to
           rethink how water is used and managed at sonae sierra shopping centres by improving the water efficiency of our portfolio and integrating
           systems for rainwater harvesting and water reuse on our sites we can reduce our exposure to water scarcity risks and minimise our water
           footprint which prepares us for potential future legislation and avoids costs

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 60 to 63 above

      b   report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
           policies and commitments
           we are committed to increasing the water efficiency of our activities within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy
           and management system procedures see page 48 above and exploring ways to reuse water under our long term priority of resource
           resilience see page 20

           with respect to our sustainability strategys long term focus on resource resilience we have committed to rollingout the use of technologies
           for harvesting rainwater and reusing water to as many sites as feasible in order to reduce and eventually remove the need to procure water
           from third parties and to reduce pressure on aquifers

           goals and targets
           our strategy pages 19 to 20

           specifically we have a long term objective to attain a level of water consumption at or below 3 litres per visit aggregated across all sonae
           sierra owned shopping centres by 2020

           under our long term focus on resource resilience we have also set the following long term objectives

            at least 10 of total water consumed at sonae sierra owned shopping centres to be reused grey water or harvested rainwater by 2020

            develop and implement a long term strategy to ensure a secure water supply at owned shopping centres with a particular focus on
             locations that are vulnerable to water shortages by 2020

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibilities and resources for managing the water aspect are covered by our safety health and environment management system
           shems see safety health and environment management system on page 48

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policy and practices on water use management through all relevant stages of the
           lifecycle  policy and practices on drainage and discharge of water
           we aim to ensure a secure water supply at all of our shopping centres with a particular focus on locations that are vulnerable to water
           shortages we use the world business council for sustainable development wbcsd global water tool to identify the areas where we are
           developing new centres that are at risk of water stress or scarcity

           when these projects go forward the companys safety health and environment development standards sheds define that specific
           equipment like water chillers must be avoided in order to minimise our vulnerability to water shortages in areas with water use restrictions
           we also ensure that water efficient design including equipment specifications and water recycling engineering solutions is maximised where
           feasible we integrate rainwater harvesting and grey water recycling systems on new projects and refurbishments to reduce the need for
           freshwater or municipal water consumption during the fit out process we set requirements for water efficient sanitary equipment such as
           sensor spray taps waterless urinals and low flush toilets

           since 2013 we have also developed a water calculator dive project to assess the water needs of every shopping centre taking into account
           its occupancy location and design it allows us to set consumption targets for the main water systems eg wcs irrigation which together
           with real time monitoring enables us to identify unusually high usage patterns and put in place tighter control mechanisms

           for shopping centres exterior areas and when landscape projects are defined we specify efficient irrigation systems and favour the use of
           autochthonous plant species in exterior landscaping for details of specific projects in 2015 to increase water efficiency and increase the
           reuse of water on our sites see operational performance pages 31 to 32

           stages of the lifecycle
           we incorporate solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources our shopping centres may have up to five different wastewater
           collection systems which enable different types of wastewater to be reused andor treated according to their characteristics wastewater
           discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water discharges to
           municipal sewers streams etc

           during the design phase we are committed to incorporating solutions that reduce pollution to local water sources for instance to prevent
           pollution from rainwater runoff we specify filter drains and porous paving in external paved areas and stormwater management plans are
           implemented to contain or decrease stormwater runoff according to the sites characteristics additionally our sheds guarantee that
           equipment like grease and hydrocarbon separators or wastewater treatment plants are installed minimising pollution through the
           pretreatment of these effluents before they are discharged

           during construction works we also place demands upon our contractors to avoid the risk of water pollution from construction activities

           during the operations phase wastewater discharges are regularly analysed by externally certified laboratories and where there are no legally
           established monitoring requirements the following biochemical parameters are periodically analysed

           monitoring
           the monitoring of our performance in relation to the water aspect is covered by our shems see governance safety health and
           environment management system pages 48 to 49 and disclosures on management approach for the environmental aspect overall
           on page 76 above

           results and adjustments
           in addition to gri indicators g4en8 g4en10 and cre2 below we monitor the water efficiency excluding tenants of owned portfolio which
           in 2015 was 34 litres of water per visit a 3 improvement compared with 2014 see operational performance page 31

           we currently have 53 rainwatergroundwater harvesting and grey water reuse systems in place across 28 shopping centres 62 of our total
           owned portfolio the systems implemented to date are enabling us to make cost savings of over 16 million per year and avoid the
           withdrawal of 643000m3 of water from municipal supplies for shopping centres located in waterstressed areas the implementation of
           water efficiency measures and reuse measures has even greater significance

           as noted under energy the built environment is responsible for around 24 of carbon dioxide co² emissions as governments respond to
           growing international and domestic pressure to tackle climate change regulations relating to buildings energy consumption and greenhouse
           gas ghg emissions are becoming more stringent there is growing evidence that high carbon emitting buildings are becoming less desirable
           to investors and occupiers by reducing the energy consumption and ghg emissions associated with our shopping centres we aim to avoid
           costs and make our properties more attractive to future investors

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

           goals and targets
           we have set long term objectives to

            achieve an 85 reduction in ghg emissions per m2 of gla by 2020 compared to the 2005 level ghg protocol scopes 1 and 2 plus

           in 2006 we developed a climate change strategy to reduce our direct and indirect ghg emissions this covers scopes 1 2 and business air
           travel part of scope 3 according to the guidelines of the ghg protocol developed by the world resources institute wri and the world
           business council for sustainable development wbcsd

           our primary strategy to achieve this is through energy efficiency initiatives we have not established a policy with regards to carbon
           offsetting although we have compensated for carbon dioxide emissions in relation to some minor events it is part of our strategy to advocate
           more sustainable practices at an industry level and information on our advocacy positions can be found on pages 58 and 124 to 125

           aside from the energy used by our shopping centres themselves we also seek to reduce the energy consumption and ghg emissions
           generated by associated activities such as vehicle emissions produced by people visiting our shopping centres or by staff travelling to and
           from work or on business trips many of our centres are working to improve access by public transport and encourage its use by featuring
           public transport timetables and cycle storage facilities

           emissions are also produced by tenants occupying our centres and we advise and educate our tenants about saving energy and reducing
           ghg emissions from their activities for example through our she good practices guide sustainability benchmarking and planet sierra
           tenant award see also stakeholder engagement page 65 and tenant engagement and satisfaction pages 135 to 136

           in 2013 we performed a materiality assessment to review our most material scope 3 ghg emissions based on the corporate value chain
           scope 3 accounting and reporting standard published by wri and wbcsd by ranking all scope 3 emissions generated by our business
           activities according to their significance and the level of influence we have over them we can focus our reduction efforts where they are
           more relevant

           landfill landfilled waste is not only an inefficient use of resources the waste and the land it can generate damaging greenhouse gas
           emissions such as methane and carbon dioxide as well as pollutants that can leach into the soil and groundwater consequently disposal
           of waste in landfill is becoming more tightly regulated and more costly in most locations where we operate on the other hand good waste
           management can reduce environment impacts and be more cost effective for businesses as it avoids landfill tax and waste disposal costs
           a closedloop approach to waste management can also cut costs and environmental impacts associated with the consumption of raw materials

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 60 to 63 above

      b   report how the organisation manages the material aspect or its impacts
           policies and commitments
           within the scope of our safety health and environment she policy and management system procedures we are committed to reducing
           the quantity of waste generated by our activities and to achieving high levels of waste recycling we are also committed to reducing our
           impacts in relation to wastewater production

           goals and targets
           we have set long term objectives to

            ensure that all discharges to local water courses comply with sonae sierras wastewater quality standards and pollutant limits by 2020

            increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused and obtain a minimum recycling rate of 65 across
             our sonae sierra owned shopping centres by 2020

            reduce the proportion of waste by weight that is sent to landfill below a maximum limit of 18 across sonae sierra owned shopping
             centres by 2020

            increase the proportion of total waste by weight that is recycled recovered or reused and obtain a minimum recycling rate of 90 across
             our main corporate offices by 2020

            maintain a high level of performance in terms of waste recycling in construction projects and aim to increase the proportion of construction
             materials with recycled content

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibilities and resources for managing the effluents and waste aspect are covered by our safety health and environment management
           system shems see safety health and environment management system on page 48 as well as our owned portfolio we also monitor
           these indicators for our corporate offices

           our site managers at each shopping centre projects under development and corporate offices are responsible for ensuring that waste is
           managed efficiently this includes providing appropriate storage areas and equipment that are well maintained preventing spillage and
           scattering during transportation and producing monthly reports of waste volumes we also provide staff with detailed instructions on waste
           codes rules for waste storage and final destination waste separation rules for nonhazardous waste and hazardous waste and waste

           in the waste hierarchy
           our sheds include a series of design requirements to maximise the waste separation potential of every shopping centre we develop so that
           once the shopping centre is in operation waste can be effectively sorted and sent for recycling and recovery a site specific waste strategy
           study is undertaken during construction to establish adequate provision of space for waste segregation bins and compactors temporary
           storage and internal preferential routes for disposal

           we take a progressive approach to waste management during construction works encouraging contractors to operate waste management
           plans aware of the difficulty that arises from the construction process being directly controlled by construction companies we are
           committed to gradually designingout waste produced during construction for example through offsite prefabrication during
           construction our shems ensures that the reduction of material use and waste is prioritised where possible we specify end of life recycling
           for building components which is particularly relevant for our refurbishment activities in addition construction companies are required to
           report back to us the results of their waste management

           during the operations phase we aim to progressively improve each shopping centres waste recycling rate the majority of waste handled
           by sonae sierra is largely generated by tenants activities aside from seeking to influence tenants practices there is little that we can do
           to reduce waste production in our centres all countries offer regular training for tenants on topics around waste avoidance segregation
           and recycling

           specifically with respect to effluents our wastewater quality standard controls wastewater quality beyond existing legal requirements these
           are set out in our wastewater management procedure and include identifying all wastewater discharges into the municipal drainage systems
           andor wastewater systems and monitoring wastewater quality in accordance with the technical instruction for wastewater management
           we analyse the results and in any cases of nonconformity we produce a report setting out corrective actions

           wastewater discharges are analysed regularly by externally certified laboratories in order to control the contamination levels of our water

              employee awareness on safety and health is delivered through a variety of tools including regular she meetings training events campaigns
              and internal publications for example

               evolve is an online employee newsletter that brings together sustainability information including safety and health content such as she
                tips and case studies in a single format

               my advice allows senior managers who are nominated to be monthly safety ambassadors to share simple safety and health messages
                with all employees

              other examples of employee initiatives include an awareness raising campaign to reduce the amount of accidents in itinere among our
              workforce and competitions such as time to be safe that was launched in conjunction with world day for safety and health at work
              we challenged our employees to identify potential in itinere risks across five different scenarios they were also encouraged to identify a
              personal health and safety commitment for 2015 more than 200 employees entered the competition and more than 80 safety and health

              that all travellers to risky destinations12 receive an email on medical and security risks in the country they are going to visit and have
              comprehensive travel insurance employees receive training on precautionary procedures they should follow when travelling abroad for
              business purposes according to the countrys specific level of risk and also on our travel incident response procedure for example during
              2015 a webinar organised by our service supplier international sos and control risks covering risks regarding womens security when
              travelling abroad based on the outcomes of drills we undertook in 2015 and 2014 in which we simulated various traveller incident scenarios
              in risky countries we also updated the travel risk incident procedure and conducted training sessions to inform employees about these
              changes the drills also served as an efficient way to train both the traveller and the corporate staff that participated and tested the efficacy

              our service suppliers management procedures for development and property management define the various steps that should be followed
              from the preselection and bidding process through to contract closure and postcontract evaluation both our development and property
              management businesses have integrated the requirements of sonae sierras shems into their service suppliers management procedures
              so that these are set up in a way to ensure that our main suppliers performance meets with sonae sierras she requirements

              within the scope of these procedures all contracts with critical suppliers must include she clauses and subcontractors have the same level of
              she requirements as contractors if no formal contracts are signed then the service supplier must sign a warranty declaration to guarantee
              that she requirements will be met we have also established she regulations for service providers which include for example the obligation for
              suppliers to adopt protective measures to minimise risks that workers are exposed to compliance with these regulations is checked during work
              supervision and for long term contracts including contractors from construction sites sh performance is evaluated during works execution

              all new shopping centre development projects must implement a sitespecific shems and achieve certification in accordance with the

              between 15  5 million or less than 10 of the assets omv and the duration of the works is less than nine months contractors must
              comply with a safety health and environment management plan shemp contractors cannot begin any activity without the validation of
              this document by the sites sh coordinator and sonae sierras prior approval

              each of our development projects has a full time sh coordinator to validate contractors risk assessments and if necessary establish
              additional control measures the sh coordinators and outsourced project management teams carry out permanent sh supervision and
              planning on construction works identifying and correcting unsafe actions wherever necessary

              we investigate the cause of all incidents and communicate these across the company so that lessons can be learned to avoid repeat
              occurrences this is done using alerts a communication tool that is also used during the construction phase we also hold regular she
              meetings and carry out emergency practice drills on all construction sites

          development phase of all our new shopping centres refurbishment or expansion projects and minor works the sheds aid us in minimising
          sh risks from the outset of each shopping centres development and into the operations phase the implementation of the standards is
          mandatory for all projects and is checked through a final audit carried out by a third party compliance with local sh regulations is also
          verified by competent authorities prior to opening as part of the licensing procedure for new shopping centres

          safety and health due diligence studies are undertaken in existing shopping centres so that we can understand the potential safety and health
          liabilities that sites may contain and therefore guarantee sufficient budget in our investment plans to adequately deal with these issues

          we also operate a corporate risk matrix that is used by centres to create a tailored risk matrix based on the sh risks to people during the
          operational phase this includes defined procedures for routine activities nonroutine activities such as fit outs and improvements to tenant

          during the design phase within our sheds there is a specific requirement which is included within the design team and contractors service
          agreements which prohibits the use of certain hazardous materials and substances as defined by sonae sierra throughout the
          construction works

          for the construction phase the use and disposal of hazardous materials is controlled by the implementation of our she procedures for
          development namely the shems for new projects the safety health and environment monitoring plan for major refurbishments and
          expansions and the small works procedure for minor interventions the onsite sh coordinators and development teams maintain a record
          of hazardous materials which come onto the site and are disposed of from the site

          during the operations phase and within corporate offices we have a procedure in place that sets out the main safety recommendations for
          handling hazardous products including the hazard characteristics of products the labelling rules storage incompatibilities and recommended
          protective measures these are supported by posters to raise awareness among service suppliers around the correct storage and handling of
          these products where possible we work with service suppliers to replace hazardous products with less hazardous alternatives that share
          similar characteristics

          we provide education and training counselling and prevention programmes for employees their families and community members regarding
          serious diseases or potential long term damage to health these programmes cover commonly identified risks associated with sonae sierra
          activities see below as well as emerging health risks that could potentially affect our stakeholders

          sonae sierra has defined a transversal procedure in our shems aimed at identifying and evaluating sh hazards and risks to sonae sierras
          stakeholders the evaluation is made for all activities covering offices shopping centres in operation and development projects and
          through which we identify the potential consequences to people identifying both injuries eg cuts burns etc and occupational diseases
          eg musculoskeletal disorders hearing loss etc

          as we evaluate a hazard we have to consider existing control measures and deficiencies the periodicityprobability of the hazards
          occurrence and its potential severity any nonacceptable risks that are identified must result in the implementation of additional risk control
          measures until the risk is classified as acceptable examples include

           in our shopping centres we identified that the inspection and testing of emergency generators could cause loss of hearing capacity to
            avoid this we implemented several controls such as short term worker exposure to noise regular noise measurements and communication
            of results and the mandatory use of suitable hearing protectors

           in our offices we identified the possibility of musculoskeletal disorders from handling air conditioning units for maintenance to avoid this
            we provide mechanical transportation equipment training on its use and regular inspections to ensure it is being used properly

          all matrices are validated by qualified technicians either country safety health and environment coordinators in offices and operational
          centres or safety  health coordinators in development sites and then approved by the respective site manager additionally in all countries
          where this is demanded by law an occupational doctor also provides followup and feedback to sonae sierra employees in regular
          consultations and evaluates each employees workstation to avoid any future occupational disease

          regarding shopping centres under development we have acknowledged that the task of identifying the number of workers that are exposed
          to a specific risk at a specific moment is extremely complex due to site specific factors and that the time and effort required for this
          identification will not produce relevant benefits to sonae sierra we focus most of our efforts on ensuring that all existent risks in each
          construction site have proper control measures in place we have identified that workers on construction sites are more exposed to noise
          vibration dust and working with concrete knowing this and to minimise the associated risks measures including worker rotation awareness
          raising and the use of personal protective equipment have been implemented

          in shopping centre management activities the risks of serious occupational diseases are less extensive than in development however
          sonae sierra has identified eleven occupational diseases relevant to service suppliers examples include tendonitis loss or reduction of
          hearing capacity and raynauds phenomenon the stakeholders that are most exposed to these risks include maintenance and cleaning
          service suppliers

          in corporate offices the only risk identified is the risk of tendonitis and carpal tunnel syndrome during 2015 there were no recorded
          occupational diseases

              events that last a day or longer

             sierra shots typically last one to two hours and are opportunities for employees to share insights that are deemed relevant and useful
              with their colleagues

          and in brazil

            development

          in all geographies apart from brazil we operate the onboarding programme which ensures that all employees have the necessary skills and
          knowledge to perform their work this includes an introduction to our approach and policy regarding safety health and environment we have

           leveraging knowledge is one of our long term sustainability priorities and through this we aim to empower our employees by building their
           skills and knowledge to unleash their potential on an individual basis and raise the standard of knowledge attainment at a collective level in
           the communities where we operate we are exploring how we can transfer knowhow in the company while increasing knowledge in our
           communities and have identified three long term objectives

            sierra with universities to partner with universities and either share our knowledge or create new knowledge with students

            we share with communities to extend our knowledge to the employees of the organisations that we wish to maintain strong links with
             such as municipalities fire brigades and local authorities

            engage value chain through knowledge to help qualify our tenants or potential tenants both owners and employees by strengthening
             their business skills and knowhow

           under each objective we have identified short term targets see results and adjustments below

           monitoring
           on an individual level all our employees receive annual performance and career development reviews on a collective level we monitor
           employee satisfaction once every two years through our corporate climate and employee satisfaction survey which asks our employees
           to rate their satisfaction with a range of factors including training and development

           results and adjustments
           during 2015 116 employees participated in the we share training programmes covering topics such as work life balance transaction prices
           in a shopping centre and the power of social media communications

           in relation to leveraging knowledge by the end of 2015 we had completed four sierra with universities projects in portugal and spain
           a further three projects in portugal and brazil were ongoing two sierra with communities projects at freccia rossa in italy and valle real
           in spain had been completed and had resulted in improved relations between the shopping centres and the local police and civil
           protection agencies

           we had also completed our first engage value chain through knowledge project at centro vasco de gama to raise tenants awareness of
           labour issues in partnership with the portuguese authority for working conditions at hofgarten solingen in germany we piloted a contest
           to help tenants improve their window displays with the goal being to help them attract more customers and improve the overall shopping
           experience for visitors

           based on the successful outcomes described above our 2016 targets are to support five case studiesthesisresearch partnerships with
           universities develop at least two community partnerships that result in improved relationships with our stakeholders and perform three
           tenant and supplier development projects

      a   report the impacts that make this aspect material
           companies where unfair treatment is present are at risk from lawsuits and fines for discrimination and are more likely to experience highlevels of
           staff turnover absence and poor team work on the contrary by applying the principles of equality and diversity and ensuring a meritocratic
           culture companies can attract a wider range of potential candidates increase levels of employee satisfaction retention and collaboration
           and prepare for emerging regulations concerning gender equality and nondiscrimination
           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material
           aspects and boundaries on pages 60 to 63

           policies and commitments including gri g4 cresd specific action  policy on gender equality including how
           gender is incorporated into procurement policy and plans
           we have a nondiscrimination and diversity policy that states our commitment to a meritocratic culture this is reinforced by our code of
           conduct which outlines our commitment to creating a workplace where each individual is treated fairly and where we recruit select train
           and remunerate based on merit experience and other professional criteria
           until now our company has not encountered barriers to gender equality in the workforce in the core countries where we operate however
           we acknowledge that this could become a more significant issue as we move into new markets such as north africa where the social
           environment may inhibit equal opportunities in terms of education and by extension access to employment in sonae sierra brasil gender
           equality has not been an issue although the number of men in managerial positions is higher

           goals and targets
           as stated above sonae sierra has a commitment to a meritocratic culture although we do not set specific quantitative objectives or targets
           relating to this aspect

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibilities and resources for employment aspects including diversity and equal opportunity and equal remuneration are described
           under the disclosures on management approach for training and education on page 110

           gri g4 cresd additional guidance  policies and practices regarding gender equality in the workplace
           we have some policies in place which among other objectives can support diversity by promoting a more flexible workplace namely
            parttime working policy
            working from home policy
            flexible work schedule policy
           within the framework of these policies we have made particular efforts over the past couple of years to introduce more flexible work
           arrangements for employees whose job function enables them to take up these options

           monitoring
           sonae sierra demonstrates its commitment to nondiscrimination in recruitment and treatment of staff in the workplace by monitoring
           workforce diversity according to a range of different characteristics within our code of conduct we pledge to treat each individual fairly and
           recruit select and train and remunerate based on merit experience and other professional criteria it is in our interest to ensure that the
           human resources talents and skills available throughout the community are considered when employment opportunities arise thereby
           selecting the most suitable person for the job based on their qualifications and experience
           we monitor employee satisfaction once every two years through our corporate climate and employee satisfaction survey which asks our
           employees to rate their satisfaction with a range of factors including equal opportunities and compensation the sierra ombudsman which is
           described on page 48 constitutes a formal procedure which employees as well as other stakeholders can use to report workrelated
           concerns including any breaches in our code of conduct

           results and adjustments
           according to the results of the 2015 corporate climate survey equal opportunities and diversity achieved an overall positive rating of 60 this is
           largely consistent with previous survey results in particular only 11 of participants either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement that
           there are equal opportunities between women and men in the workplace and only 6 either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the statement
           that in sonae sierra there are equal opportunities without discrimination regardless of racereligionsexual orientation etc

      on 31 december 2015 sonae sierra owned 45 shopping centres and had 11 projects under development including four for third parties and four
      new projects in the pipeline

      our community advisory panels caps which are described on page 119 above are in place across 40 89 of our operational shopping centres

      environmental impact studies or preliminary environmental evaluations are carried out on 100 of new development projects and on major
      expansions where we have direct control for example in the case of a joint venture they include specifications such as the identification of
      locations of historical architectural and archaeological value and data on important socioeconomic indicators within the study area when we begin
      new projects we perform a feasibility analysis which involves analysing the competition and impact of our activities on competitors performance

      our geo tracking studies evaluate the impact of our shopping centres on local consumer habits on an annual basis in 2015 geo tracking studies
      were performed at 34 74 of our shopping centres

      aside from these we do not have any local community impact assessment programmes in place across our portfolio

      during the commercial licensing phase of new shopping centre projects we are obliged to comply with the planning obligations defined in each
      country and by each local authority for example in some locations we must set aside part of the site for the creation of green spaces and if this is
      not possible on the site in question we must pay a compensatory fee so that green spaces can be created in alternative areas the development of
      transport infrastructure around new shopping centre sites including roads bicycle paths and parking spaces footpaths etc is another example of
      infrastructure developed for community benefit in some instances to meet with mandatory requirements of local authorities and in others to meet
      with our own safety health and environment development standards eg regarding the promotion of sustainable travel

      many of our shopping centres also offer play areas for children crèche services sports and waste recycling facilities which are available for the local

           this aspect was identified as material according to the materiality review performed by sonae sierra in 2015 which was based on a number
           of criteria covering both sonae sierras impacts and stakeholders opinions for further details see our response to identified material

           the code of conduct includes one specific guideline on the avoidance of bribery and corruption by stating that it is forbidden to give or
           accept any reward or benefit with the purpose of influencing someones behaviour to obtain a commercial advantage

           confirming that they had received the code of conduct and agreed to comply with its provisions

           our internal communications procedures include an email that is sent to new employees and which contains a welcome manual that links to
           the sonae sierra code of conduct in this way we ensure that sonae sierras anticorruption policies and procedures are communicated to

           transactions our asset management and development businesses follow the rics guidelines transactions are subject to approval by the
           board of directors of the special purpose vehicles the board of directors of sonae sierra and in many cases by the investment companies
           of the funds whilst there are no specific guidelines to mitigate risks with respect to valuations the entity that carries out most valuations for
           sonae sierra indicates in its report that the fees collected from sonae sierra represent less than 5 of its revenue on a global basis

           within the context of our property management activities the procedure of getting bids for the services we contract out to suppliers
           minimises the risk of anticompetitive behaviour in the supply chain taking into consideration the strong involvement of several corporate
           organisational structures related to this process shopping centre management and central operation departments this procedure also
           ensures a clear coherent and accepted recommendation thus supporting the final award decision

           sustainability and corporate communication

           specific actions  significant issues that are the focus of public policy development and core position
           we participate in lobbying activities under our own initiative and through industry associations with local authorities and national
           governments for example in 2015 we worked with the portuguese council of shopping centres apcc to lobby for changes to national
           regulations covering the frequency of fire safety inspections and security measures in both cases we supported the principles behind the
           legislation but argued that they did not reflect the circumstances specific to our industry in the case of fire safety inspections our own
           standards exceeded those set out in the legislation

           we are also involved in defining policy positions led by industry organisations including the european property federations responses to a
           range of european union directives and legislative initiatives during 2015 we contributed to a position paper for the eu commission
           regarding changes to the energy performance of buildings directive and the energy efficiency directive the paper set out
           recommendations for energy efficiency improvements in energy performance certificates epcs and for the inclusion of a clause enabling
           member states to allow building owners to use the common voluntary eu epc for nonresidential buildings as an alternative to national

           to public policy development
           during 2015 sonae sierra supported several initiatives that had benefitted our industry and stakeholders these included changes to

           include safety and health days school visits and shopping centre tours the majority of incidents involving visitors include falls at the same
           level and escalator accidents between 2013 and 2015 we conducted several studies in portugal and spain to identify the areas with the
           highest risks of slips as a result we are implementing a range of antislip measures across the 15 shopping centres evaluated these include
           antislip treatment to floors and travellators additional matting near the entrances and training for cleaners

           further initiatives to increase awareness around accident prevention and safety among the centres visitors in portugal include segurarte
           segurarte is a competition for artists and art students to create artwork promoting safety measures when using moving stairs and carpets in
           our centres

           if necessary we work with our suppliers to put in place preventive measures for example we developed a protective handrail in cooperation
           with the escalator manufacturer schindler portugal the handrail was developed in response to a number of accidents involving children on
           escalators at shopping centres not owned by sonae sierra so far the installation of handrail protection has been rolled out across portugal
           and is due to be rolled out across all countries under the management of schindler

           tenant surveys we engage with visitors in order to understand what drives their behaviour and purchasing decisions by responding to
           feedback from these visitors we can improve the quality of our shopping centres and promote more sustainable practices in retail and
           consumerism this is likely to result in higher footfall and sales as well as other benefits thereby supporting the long term success of our

           we do not have specific policies or commitments concerning the frequency with which we conduct customer surveys mall tracking surveys
           see monitoring below are conducted regularly but their exact frequency is determined by individual shopping centre budgets

           sonae sierra and service suppliers who conduct surveys on our behalf are required to comply with the international chamber of
           commerceesomars international code on market and social research the code sets out a selfregulatory framework for market
           researchers covering issues such as compliance with national and international laws ethical conduct and the use of personal information

           other customer feedback tools include the customer contact management system which gives visitors an opportunity to provide feedback
           directly to our shopping centres complaints can also be presented to the sierra ombudsman see page 48

           goals and targets
           mall tracking surveys include a set of questions that relate to the customer experience although we do not set a target to achieve a
           minimum satisfaction level if visitors provide written feedback via the customer contact management system we have response targets as
           outlined in our service level agreement sla see below

           responsibilities and resources
           responsibility for visitor satisfaction and engagement lies with our shopping centre managers supported by the central marketing
           department see monitoring for details on visitor surveys and feedback mechanisms and how we respond

                  monitoring
                  we regularly undertake mall tracking surveys at our shopping centres to help us understand our visitors profiles their behaviour and
                  requirements these surveys monitor trends in visitor satisfaction expectations loyalty and behaviour shopping centres develop action
                  plans on the basis of the survey results paying particular attention to critical success factors affecting visitor numbers and short term
                  actions necessary to correct any negative results we also conduct specific corporate responsibility surveys to better understand visitor
                  attitudes towards sustainability and target our initiatives and communications accordingly

                  we have a customer feedback system in place called customer contact management which provides a unique source of learning for our shopping
                  centres we encourage visitors to submit their suggestions and complaints either verbally or in writing if verbal contacts cannot be resolved
                  immediately we escalate them to written contacts and request that customers submit their feedback in writing or we submit the feedback on
                  their behalf via a form we ensure that the shopping centre manager personally responds to all suggestions and complaints received

                  when visitors offer their time to provide written feedback it is essential to show that we take their views seriously the first step is to ensure an
                  adequate answer in a short period of time this timing is measured against the sla the objective is to respond to customers in three working
                  days but acknowledging that this is not always feasible the sla target is 70 answered in three days 95 in one week and 100 in two weeks
                  during 2015 we received approximately 1925 written contacts of which 90 were responded to in three days and 99 within two weeks

                  we have consistent procedures for written and verbal contacts with customers and all employees working at our shopping centres including
                  security cleaning maintenance and administration employees are trained in how to manage verbal feedback through tools including a
                  training film presentation and a pocket book summarising the correct procedures and behaviours

                  in 2015 we undertook an assessment of the customer contact management system to assess its effectiveness in dealing with verbal and
                  written contacts a mystery shopper technique was used to evaluate employees customer care skills and compliance with our customer
                  care standards both within shopping centres and through calls made to the call centre the overall results were positive but we have
                  identified a number of opportunities to improve the process further which we plan to roll out in 2016 these include additional training for our
                  customerfacing employees at shopping centres and improvements to the process for handling email contacts

                  shopping centre visitors may also present complaints to the sierra ombudsman

      data qualifying note
      the visitor satisfaction results are based on a sample of 500 interviews which are proportionally stratified according to the shopping centre traffic the survey takes the form of a
      personal interview based on a structured questionnaire the numbertype of visitors who receive the interview are selected through systematic counting during one week the old
      methodology is based on a survey in which different factors are rated from 1 to 4 according to the visitors assessments the new methodology is based on a survey in which
      different factors are rated from 1 not satisfied to 5 very satisfied and between 5 to 20 items are valued taking these valuations we create an indicator on a scale of 1 to 100
      the indicator for the new methodology includes shopping centres owned and in operation for the full reporting year in portugal 11 out 21 spain 1 out 7 and brazil 2 out 10
      which performed visitor satisfaction surveys in 2015
      the indicator for the old methodology includes shopping centres owned and in operation for the full reporting year which performed visitor satisfaction surveys in 2015 alexa and
      loop 5 in germany and pantheon plaza in greece are not included since studies were not performed or didnt include the visitor satisfaction index in 2015
      in 2015 the methodology for both approaches was changed as only visitor satisfaction indexes obtained from studies performed in the reporting year were taken into consideration
      whereas previously visitor satisfaction indexes obtained from earlier years were included if the shopping centre had not conducted a study in the reporting year

           and compare the performance of different tenants with similar operations in the same centre or similar units in different shopping centres
           if we detect that a tenant has a very high effort ratio we arrange a facetoface meeting with the store management team to seek to
           understand the reasons for this and if possible help the tenant to find a solution

          review report



          introduction

              its accordance with the disclosure of information requirements defined by the guidelines for sustainability
               reporting of the global reporting initiative version v4 of 2013 gri g4 for the core option and additional
               contents and performance indicators required by the gris g4 construction and real estate sector
               disclosures gri cresd related to the material sustainability aspects including the reliability of the
               overall related information and 2015 data as identified in annex global reporting initiative
              sonae sierras own sustainability performance indicators 2015 data disclosed in the eesr 2015
               in accordance with the therein mentioned criteria
              the information on progress against the 2015 sustainability targets and management actions
               in accordance with the criteria established by sonae sierra disclosed in its internet site as identified in the
               chapter operational performance of the report and
              the sonae sierra environmental accounting model information and results for the property management
               activity disclosed in disclosures on management approach of the environmental material aspect overall
               within annex global reporting initiative in accordance with the therein mentioned criteria

          responsibilities
          2 sonae sierras board of directors is responsible for preparing the economic environmental and social
             report 2015 as well as defining implementing and carrying out adequate processes procedures internal
             control systems and criteria for collecting processing presenting and validating the information contained
             therein our responsibility is to issue a report based on the procedures referred to below on the information
             referred to above

          scope
          3 we conducted our review in accordance with the international standard on assurance engagements 3000 
             isae 3000 revised issued by the international auditing and assurance standards board regarding
             assurance engagements other than audit or reviews of historical financial information for a moderated level
             of assurance
          4 this standard requires that we plan and perform procedures and apply audit skills and techniques in order to
             obtain an adequate understanding of the matters under review and considering the circumstances to obtain
             sufficient appropriate evidence on which to base our conclusions in a limited assurance engagement the
             procedures performed consist primarily of inquiries of sonae sierras employees and analytical procedures
             including tests on a sample basis and therefore less assurance is obtained than in an engagement aimed at
             obtaining reasonable assurance

           5 the main procedures performed were
               interview of sonae sierras employees responsible for the preparation of the eesr 2015 and for the reported
                data so as to know and understand the management and reporting principles systems and procedures
                applied as well as the associated control mechanisms

                the quantitative data as well as tests to corroborate the quantitative and qualitative data included in the
                scope of our work by obtaining and reviewing related evidence thereof and
               review of the consistency of the sustainability information included in the eesr 2015 and related publicly
                available reports and that it does not contradict any significant information included in the 2015 sonae
                sierras consolidated report and accounts

           opinion
           6 based on the work performed as described in paragraph 5 above which was executed to obtain a moderate
              level of assurance nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability
              information included in or publically available and related to the eesr 2015 referred to in paragraph 1 above
              has not been reliably and consistently prepared and that it does not conform in all material respects with the
              disclosure requirements of the gri g4 guidelines for the core option and whenever applicable with gri cresd
              as well as with the criteria defined by sonae sierra
