 thriving with communities
 growing globally

 in october 2012 we formulated our fifth mediumterm management planjr east group management vision v 
 ever onwardunder the sloganthriving with communities growing globallythis plan renews our commitment
 to the twin pillars of our business continuing to work tofulfill our eternal missionsand striving to succeed in our
pursuit of unlimited potential
 the experience of the great east japan earthquake reminded all our employees of our ties to local communities
 and the great expectations that society places on our railway company as a company responsible for maintaining
 social infrastructure the disaster brought home to us how vital it is that we work with a sense of mission to meet
 the public s expectations today the jr east region and the entire country face a number of serious problems
 our mottothriving with communities growing globallyis also a pledge we will come together with local
 communities to think about the kind of future we want and will do everything we can to use our unique position to
 build vibrant communities and open a way to the future for our railway


  continuing to fulfill oureternal missions
 as a group dedicated tothriving with communitiesour fundamental duty is to contribute to the development of
 those communities by providing safe and highquality services we must work to meet the expectations that local
 communities place in us and reinforce the trust that is the foundation of everything we do we must never forget that
 a single accident is enough to destroy this trust this is why safety has always been our numberone priority ever
 since the jr east group was formed we have constantly worked to improve our safety standards fy2015 marked
 the start of our new fiveyear safety plan the jr east group safety plan 2018 under which we will work to cultivate
 the highest levels of safety awareness among all our employees by striving to improve safety through the actions we
 take on a daily basis our aim is to achieveultimate safety levelsin which the individual efforts of every employee
 are solidified by teamwork the importance of these efforts was brought home to us again in february 2014 when
 one of our trains derailed and caused an accident at kawasaki station on the keihin tohoku line we must ensure
 that there is no further repetition of this kind of event in addition to redoubling our accident prevention efforts we
 are determined to learn the lessons from past accidents we will carry out a thorough investigation to locate any
 weaknesses in our safety procedures and find
 measures to resolve them
 we are also continuing to improve our
 preparedness for natural disasters in addition to
 the 300 billion yen we have invested in seismic
 reinforcement to prepare for the eventuality of
 a major earthquake directly beneath the tokyo
 metropolitan area we are also taking steps to
 guard against natural disasters and extreme
 weather events including major snowfall heavy
 rain and strong winds all of which have occurred
 with increasing frequency and caused substantial
 damage in recent years as we work to build a
 railway that can withstand natural disasters of
 all types we will also continue work to install
 automatic platform gates in our stations as
 well as the ongoing work to install these gates
 in stations along the yamanote line we are
 considering expanding this measure to other
 lines
 alongside safety another of our major missions
 is service quality reform in a context where a
 decline in the productive workingage population
 in the jr east area seems unavoidable
 stimulating demand for our railway will be an
 important issue for the group in the future one
 approach will be to expand our rail network we
 will use the opportunities presented by major

projects like the new hokuriku shinkansen to kanazawa and the ueno tokyo line that will open in 2015 to increase
customer use in addition to these new infrastructure developments we will work to build a reliable and comfortable
railway service and keep passengers better informed through information and communications technology ict
every single group employee will help to createjr east service qualitythat will be second to none in the industry
to achieve our goal of becoming no 1 in customer satisfaction in the railway industry
we will work to harness the potential of tourism which is an area in which our strengths can be brought most
fully to bear this will help us to cement the ties that bind us to local communities as well as helping to promote
and revitalize those communities we have joined with local communities to develop destination campaigns that
highlight the unique attractions of a particular area as another resource for attracting visitors to the tohoku region
and helping to revitalize the communities there will be our growing number ofconcepttrains that people ride for
the sake of enjoying the onboard experience these include thesl gingasteam locomotive hauled train on the
kamaishi line and thetoreiyuresort train on sections of our shinkansen the number of tourists visiting japan
from overseas has increased dramatically in recent years and increasing demand in this sector will be particularly
important accordingly we are redoubling our efforts to promote an inbound tourist strategy in order to attract
as many people as possible to the region we will establish agolden route for travel in east japanand work
together with our travel partners in taiwan and other places to drive demand for tourism in japan among overseas
visitors
as part of our ongoing efforts to rebuild infrastructure in tohoku we are continuing to restore rail lines along the
coast that were damaged by the tsunami providing a substitute for damaged railway lines by operating bus rapid
transit brt services along the kesennuma and ofunato lines and reducing travel time between sendai and
ishinomaki by constructing the sensekitohoku connecting line
as part of our focus onthriving with communitieswe are actively working to develop attractive towns centered on
railway stations as well as ongoing largescale renovations and development of major terminal stations in the tokyo
metropolis we plan to developonestop smart stationsin core regional cities these will concentrate in one place
vital services and functions including medical childcare care facilities for the elderly and local government services
in particular we have announced a new station to be built on the yamanote line between tamachi and shinagawa
stations which is tentatively scheduled to open in 2020 to coincide with the largescale development this will
involve we have developed plans to transform the area into an international hub where people can come together
and exchange ideas at the same time we will continue to join together with local communities and help to energize
local economies by facilitating the creation of new businesses that integrate agriculture fishing and forestry with
secondary and tertiary industries


 pursuing unlimited potential
the second pillar ofgroup management vision vis our determination to grow globally railway companies
because of their sheer scale are at risk of becoming selfabsorbed and inwardlooking a corporate culture that is
satisfied with the status quo will not survive in an age of dramatic change we must develop and harness the skills of
every one of our employees and grow as a group building a corporate culture that gives all of our employees belief
in theirunlimited potentialand the confidence to pursue it
globalization will be key to this strategy we are considering many railway projects in overseas markets which we
expect will be worth 22 trillion yen by 2020 our aim is to harness our skills in manufacturing rolling stock as well as
our maintenance and operations knowhow to develop our business in global markets although these efforts are in
their infancy the group is already responsible for providing rolling stock and maintenance services for the mrt purple
line in bangkok thailand which is due to begin operations in 2016 we are also actively dispatching employees to
a wide variety of countries to provide consulting and technical assistance in areas around the world
another key will be technological innovation our plans for this include several priorities energy and environmental
strategies innovations using information and communication technology ict and further increases in shinkansen
operational speed we encourage our employees to pursue open innovation rather than focusing exclusively on
the technologies of jr east or the railway industry alone we encourage them to seek out technologies from other
companies and industries that can help the group to achieve breakthroughs that go beyond the values we have had
in the past


 pursuing energy and environmental strategies
responding to global environmental problems is a priority for our business our environmental efforts which include
introducing energysaving railcars and leds for lighting have produced substantial results reducing the total amount
of co2 emissions produced by our railway operations and lessening the burden on the environment rail travel
enjoys a reputation as an environmentally friendly mode of transportation but the automotive industry has achieved
remarkable developments in energyefficient and environmentally friendly technology in recent years including hybrid
vehicles electric cars and fuel cell vehicles
for this reason as mentioned above we have made energy and environmental strategies one of the pillars
of our plans for technological innovation we are making concerted efforts to achieve a more evolved railway
environmentally concentrating on three aspects energy creation energy conservation and the introduction of smart

grid technologies
in energy creation we are actively introducing renewable energy including solar wind geothermal and biomass
energy in particular we have plans to develop northern tohoku into a renewable energy base making full use of
its natural environment and also encouraging economic revitalization surveys have already begun in many areas
as part of our work to ensure a stable power supply we opened a new no 4 generator at the kawasaki thermal
power station and have begun renovations on the no 1 generator at the same plant
on energy conservation we continue to develop facilities at ourecosteecological model stations which bring
together a variety of environmental innovations and we are moving ahead with plans to replace conventional
lighting and electronic display devices with leds in march 2014accum eve301a hybrid railcar train using an
accumulator system was introduced on the karasuyama line we have further plans to build on this technology
to develop railcars through service between alternating current ac electrified railway lines and nonelectrified
segments this will permit electric railcar operations without installing catenary overhead power lines we are
also moving ahead with rd on new railway cars equipped with ictdrivenautomatic powersaving operation
functions
in terms of smart grid technologies we have plans in place to introduce energy management systems ems into
stations in fy2015 we started automated demand control of the power used at kokubunji and nishifunabashi
stations we are also continuing to research effective uses of regenerative power and aim to develop viable practical
applications as soon as possible
through these measures by fy2021 we aim to reduce energy usage in railway operations by 8 compared to
fy2011 and to improve the co2 emissions coefficient of jr east power stations by 30 compared to fy1991 in
april 2014 we established new threeyear targets to be achieved in fy2017 we will implement these efforts with a
plan and further continue to collect the result data

going forward the entire jr east group will continue to work together to fulfill oureternal missionsof providing
safe and highquality services and contributing to local communities at the same time we will continue our pursuit
ofunlimited potentialworking together with the rest of the community to open up new possibilities for the future

       aiming to achieve
special topic 1




      extreme safety levels

group safety plan 2018
since its foundation jr east has been formulating five 5year safety plans which place safety as our most
important management issue
this year jr east formulated its 6th and newest 5year safety plan group safety plan 2018 which
endeavors to encourage each one of us to expand our capabilities in order to realize safety through team
work each one of us involved in the railway business endeavors to improve upon the current levels of
safety and to continue our challenge to achieveextreme safety levelsacross the entire group
in group safety plan 2018 together with redefining the direction we are taking as a company we outline
specific measures aimed at preventing accidents resulting from internal factors additionally through
our ongoing efforts to pass on technologies and promote measures to comprehensively understand the
severity of accidents we aim to further enhance safety management through the fostering of safety
conscious personnel
in its sixth 5year safety plan jr east plans to invest approximately 1 trillion yen over the five years for
safety equipment


   major features of group safety plan 2018
a safety plan focusing strongly on the jr east group
                     s railway business is firmly supported through the various coalitions and efforts of its
the safety of jr east
railway employees and its group and partner companies additionally as more and more work continues
to require the cooperation of the jr east group as a whole the sixth 5year safety plan has focused more
on our strength as a group and we have chosen the name for this plan to reinforce our unity as a group


reaffirming our directions
as its primary goal group safety plan 2018 which is the successor to the 2013 safety plan endeavors
to realize zero accidents involving passenger injuries or fatalities and zero accidents involving employee
fatalities including the employees of group and partner companies to achieve this goal we will focus
on specific measures while targeting three directions


preventing the occurrence of all accidents due to internal factors
through improvements to our railway operations and maintenance we aim to prevent all accidents due
to preventable internal factors these include such accidents as those resulting from failures within the jr
east group to confirm signals or errors in maintenance work procedures


reducing the risk of accidents resulting from predictable external factors
to minimize damage from accidents due to external factors such as natural disasters we are working to
reduce risk through the planned strengthening of our railway facilities


cooperating with the community to implement comprehensive measures against
accidents that are closely related to society
together with our customers and members of the local communities we are taking comprehensive
measures to counter accidents at level crossings and passengers falling onto platforms through the
sharing of information on measures such as combining and eliminating level crossings and developing
people s awareness of the risks involved in railways we aim to implement specific initiatives which will
steadily eliminate these accidents
                                                     14

a focus on passing technologies down to new generations
as the time is rapidly approaching for many skilled veteran employees to enter into retirement we
position the next five years to be their last chance to pass on their technological abilities to their
successors we aim to take specific measures in improving our safety management by actively and
deliberately passing down these technologies and through measures to thoroughly understand the gravity
of accidents




 the four pillars of group safety plan 2018
pillar 1 ingraining the cultures of safety
with the cultures of safety at the foundation of our safety measures we aim to further ingrain this
mentality in our employees


pillar 2 improving safety management
we aim to foster safetyoriented personnel through the passing on of safetyrelated technologies and
knowledge additionally we will work on measures to comprehensively understand the gravity of
accidents and the importance of minimizing human error


pillar 3 steadily reducing risk
we aim to greatly reduce risk from accidents resulting from internal factors additionally we endeavor
to reduce risk from accidents due to external factors such as large scale earthquakes and other natural
disasters such as those caused by atypical weather furthermore for risks from accidents closely related
to society and for safety measures for places like level crossings and platforms we will cooperate with
our customers and the people of local communities to implement comprehensive measures


pillar 4 priority improvement plan for safety equipment
in group safety plan 2018 jr east plans to invest approximately 1 trillion yen in safety equipment
specifically we will continue our countermeasures against large scale earthquakes and those against
level crossing accidents and to further improve our safety equipment we will install platform doors at
23 stations on the yamanote line and have plans and priorities for introducing them at other stations on
other lines

                   toward restoration from the
special topic 2




                   earthquake and revival of communities
measures against earthquakes
learning from the experiences of the great hanshinawaji earthquake of january 1995 the sanriku
minami earthquake of may 2003 and the mid niigata prefecture earthquake of october 2004 jr east
has introduced emergency train stop measures seismic reinforcement measures to its elevated bridge
columns bridge piers tunnels and station buildings taken preventive measures against derailments and
increased the number of seismometer locations
thanks to these and other measures nobody on board our trains was killed or injured at the time of the
great east japan earthquake of march 11 2011
since fy2010 jr east has expanded its countermeasures and initiated the 2nd phase of its seismic
reinforcement measures including further seismic reinforcement of elevated bridge columns in addition
jr east has designated the five years from fy2013 as a priority improvement period and is striving to
provide disasterresilient railways through the introduction of the following measures



      ① seismic reinforcement measures for embankments earth cuttings brick arch elevated bridges
         and power poles and measures to prevent the collapse of station platform ceilings and walls
         if an earthquake directly strikes the tokyo metropolitan area jr east will also accelerate the
         implementation of its plans for continuing the seismic reinforcement of its elevated bridge columns and
         bridge piers
      ② seismic reinforcement measures for station buildings where the number of boarding and alighting
         passengers exceeds 3000 persons per day and for shinkansen power poles many of which were
         damaged during the great east japan earthquake
      ③ strengthening of antidisaster telecommunication functions including an increase in the transmission
         speed of seismometer measurement data and the reinforcement of emergency power sources for
         our communication network




                                                                                                  total no of locations

measures for protection against tsunami
prior to the 2011 great east japan earthquake jr east had already designated tsunami hazard areas and
set operational restrictions for each of its branch offices formulated manuals and conducted drills in the
guidance of passengers evacuating from trains after the earthquake jr east has further reviewed all of
its tsunamirelated rules manuals and drills based on the reviewed rules and established policies jr east
carried out the following actions in fy2013



  establishment of tsunami warning zones in each of our branch offices after reexamination based
   on hazard maps of municipalities and tsunami flooded areas resulting from the great east japan
   earthquake
  systemic improvement of displays showing evacuation route maps and signage at and between
   stations
  working together with local municipalities to install emergency stairs to evacuation shelters and
   providing signs to indicate escape routes in places where evacuation is difficult
  establishment and review of tsunami response manuals in all workplaces that could be at risk
  implementation of regular education and training around march 11 in all workplaces that could
   suffer from a tsunami based on tsunami evacuation principles the tsunami response manual and
   other sources




                   a drill to guide passengers in getting off trains        evacuation route map




drills and support provision for people facing difficulties getting home
when train services were interrupted during and after the 2011 great east japan earthquake stations
were crowded with passengers in the future after confirming the safety of our facilities jr east will
strive to keep passenger restrooms open and public phones available at stations throughout the tokyo
metropolitan area provide customers with as much information as possible and offer temporary shelter in
concourses and elsewhere at approximately 200 stations these designated stations have been listed on
the jr east website since march 5 2013 and the information on temporary shelter spaces and requests
to customers has been widely publicized as station initiatives that would follow largescale earthquakes
at approximately 30 major terminal stations including tokyo and shinjuku jr east has been stockpiling
supplies including drinking water blankets and firstaid kits for children and the elderly by the end of
fy2014 this project has been expanded to approximately 170 stations within a 30km radius of tokyo
jr east also has conducted joint drills with the local municipalities to increase our ability to support
people who have difficulty returning to their homes in the event of a disaster affecting major terminal
stations together with local municipalities jr east is working to improve evacuation guidance methods in
the event of disasters and to be generally better prepared




     stockpiling supplies                                                              a drill to support people who have difficulty

measures to support the restoration of disasterdamaged areas in fy2014
the areas affected by the great east japan earthquake are still in the process of reconstruction and their
revitalization with the power of tourism is an important mission of jr east in fiscal 2014 we conducted
the sendai  miyagi destination campaign dc over the months april  june and the akita dc over the
months october  december throughout the same year we promoted the go tohoku campaign
which we launched in fiscal 2013 as a symbol of our efforts to assist recovery and publicized travel to
the tohoku region on a continuous basis in addition we commenced sales of bus tour plans to support
recovery and emphasized transportation of visitors to coastal communities such as minamisanriku and
kesennuma which incurred tremendous damage from the tsunami we also marketed a tour plan to
support the affected areas that was linked with an aid project of the tokyo metropolitan government
under the banner go fukushima nice price in summer fukushima and a bus tour for support of
recovery in iwate prefecture with a guided tour of disaster sites the latter included financial aid for the
affected areas in these and other ways we strove to assist recovery and revitalize communities in these
areas

during restoration support events in sendai station dila nishifunabashi and dila mitaka jr east provided
concrete assistance by offering sales channels for products from disasteraffected area where production
has been resumed and sales outlets for residents of disasteraffected areas
at ueno and akihabara stations in tokyo jr east continuously hosted events such as farmersmarkets
andnomonolocal produce shops which focused on eastern japan including disasterstruck areas
we also launched a new event titled sanriku marketplace which focused on communities in the sanriku
district at this event customers were able to buy seasonal foods and sake directly from sanriku farmers
and sake brewers

tsunamidamaged railway linesbasic policy  restoration status
jr east has been carrying out posttsunami reconstruction with the goal of resuming train operations on
line sections where safety can be guaranteed along the pacific coast which incurred tremendous damage
from the tsunami services have now resumed along the entire hachinohe line and on most sections of
the joban senseki and ishinomaki lines
on the joban line between soma and hamayoshida the senseki line between takagimachi and
rikuzenono and the ishinomaki line between urashuku and onagawa we are laying track for restoration
of railway service in step with community reconstruction we are aiming for resumption of service in the
spring of 2017 on this section of the joban line by june 2015 on the senseki line and the spring of
2015 on the ishinomaki line
there are many factors that we must consider regarding the resumption of operations on the joban line
section between hirono and haranomachi which runs partially within the 20km radius exclusion zone
around the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station before making any decisions we will consider all
aspects of reconstruction including reviews of line sections decontamination activities implemented by
the ministry of the environment the condition of infrastructural redevelopment the situation regarding the
return of former residents and requests from local governments track restoration on the section between
hirono and tatsuta began early enough for us to restore service when the residents of communities along
the line were permitted to return and service was resumed on june 1 2014
on the kesennuma and ofunato lines we started a bus rapid transit brt program so that we
could provide safe convenient service at an early date this has been improved by measures such as
lengthening the exclusive brt roadways and introducing odeca an ic boarding card system
for the yamada line section we made a proposal to local government organizations for integrating its
operation with the north and south rias lines which are operated by the locally based sanriku railway
company this proposal which is now under discussion was raised from the perspective of encouraging
service use through operation rooted in the area which would be sustainable and responsive to local
needs
the suspension of train operations along line sections badly damaged by the earthquake and tsunami

 waste disposal
 waste includes salable waste
 recycling includes thermal recycling where general and industrial wastes are incinerated with heat recovery
  thermal recycling is a recycling method in which the heat arising from the incineration of waste is used to create steam and hot water which in turn are used to generate electricity
   and to produce heat

evaluation of fy2014 goals
electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume
for reducing energy used for train operation we have developed and introduced energyefficient trains
and electricity storage devices when the tohoku shinkansen was extended from hachinohe to shin
aomori in 2010 however this increased the proportion of electricity consumption accounted for by the
shinkansen  which requires more electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume
kwhcarkm than conventional lines as part of our targets for fy2017 we will establish objectives
for conventional lines as well as for the shinkansen as we prepare to begin operation of the hokuriku
shinkansen

environmental targets for fy2015 and beyond
since 1996 the jr east group has undertaken environmental preservation activities based on concrete
targets with the implementation period of environmental targets set in fy2012 having come to an end in
fy2014 and toward our targets for fy2021 an 8 reduction in the volume of energy consumed through
railway operations continuous efforts are required and for this we have established environmental
targets with the aim of achieving them during fy2017

concept for establishing fy2017 targets
ofenvironmental targets for fy2015 and beyondpage 23 the targets that have been newly
established as targets to be met by fy2017 are based on the following concept



fy2017 target electricity used for railway operations per unit of transport volume 59
reduction on both shinkansen and conventional lines kwhcarkmrelative to fy2011 level
shinkansen 271  255 kwhcarkm conventional lines 165  155 kwhcarkm

approximately 80 of the energy consumed by jr east is accounted for by energy used in railway
operations a significant portion of that is electricity required to operate trains and in order to achieve a
reduction in energy consumption we must steadily achieve a reduction in this area in the case of fy2014
targets shinkansen and conventional lines were managed collectively however in anticipation of the
opening of the hokuriku shinkansen at the end of fy2015 shinkansen and conventional lines will be
managed independently with respect to fy2017 targets based on the concept of the energy saving act
we have set the target at 1 reduction for each consecutive year




fy2017 target energy consumption per unit of floor area at branch offices etc 15 reduction
klcrude oil equivalentm2relative to fy2011 level 00467  00397 klcrude oil equivalentm2
while reducing energy consumed through railway operations it is also necessary to work to reduce
energy consumed at branch office buildings as a result of the introduction of highefficiency devices
and electricity conservation following the earthquake we succeeded in achieving a reduction of 12 in
fy2013 the goal established this term based on planning for energyefficient facilities and continuation
of existing electricityconservation measures is to continually reduce energy intensity at an annual rate of
1 in line with the idea of the energy saving act


fy2017 target implementation of more ecoste model stations  total of 8 stations
as of march 2014 there are 3 ecoste model stations in our network yotsuya hiraizumi kaihinmakuhari
going forward through studies and design we will aim to develop 5 more stations



fy2017 target change to led for platform illumination
2015  within fy2017 more than 50 of the lightning equipment is switched to led at
60 stations
based on the assumption that the replacement schedules for platform illumination can differ based
on direction we will establish 50 or more as the standard going forward through the steady
implementation of replacement we will aim to introduce led lighting at more than 50 of an additional
60 stations



fy2017 target optimization of largescale airconditioning systems
2015  within fy2017 5 locations
as the energyreduction effect of the optimization of largescale airconditioning systems is significant we
will aim to conduct studies and design and to achieve optimization at 5 locations



fy2017 target reduction rate of energy consumption intensity established by each jr
east group company continuous reduction at an annual rate of 1 on average groupwide
in accordance with the energy saving act we have established a target of an average annual reduction
of 1 fy2015  fy2017 each jr east group company is required to establish its own energy intensity
indicator which should be closely related to the indicator already established under the energy saving
act

fy2017 target recycling rate for all waste
with regard to the recycling rate for all waste in accordance with the achievement of the desired
recycling rate in fy2014 the numeric value will not be reduced  we have decided to set the numeric
target increasingly higher and continue to conduct activities centered around the 3rs toward the
realization of a recyclable society




fy2017 target implementation rate of recycling by group companies100
for trash and industrial waste generated by all group companies we intend to achieve this objective
through various means of recycling we aim to achieve a 100 recycling rate by fy2017




fy2017 target setting of numeric targets by all group companies
all group companies in accordance with the characteristics of their operations will establish their own
targets and conduct activities toward their achievement

measures to prevent global warming
energy conservation and co2 reduction
the electricity consumed by jr east for train operations as well as for lighting and air conditioning at
stations and in offices is supplied by jr easts own power plants and by electric power companies
besides electricity we also use diesel fuel and kerosene for diesel train operation and for air conditioning
at stations and in offices we will strive to save energy for train operation which accounts for about 80
of our total energy consumption and reduce co2 emissions in various ways

         regarding change in method of computation
          until fy2006 computation concerning co 2 emissions and energy consumption volume through the use of
          electricity and fuel was based on the keidanren voluntary action plan on the environment beginning in fy2007
          the computation method was revised based on the energy saving act and the act on promotion of global warming
          countermeasures

         the energy consumption is converted to joules according to the energy saving act except for the electricity
           generated by jr east  s own hydroelectric plant which is converted to joules using 976 mjkwh as the conversion
           factor jr east uses 0 mjkwh as the conversion factor for our own hydroelectric power in our report submitted to
           the government as required by the act

 trends in jr east
 our co2 emissions in the fiscal year ending march 2014 totaled 215 million tons a decrease of 018
 million tons over the previous fiscal year this is the result of a decrease in the co2 emission coefficient of
 electricity generated by jr east beginning this fiscal year we also report co2 emissions in scopes 1 and
 2 in accordance with the definition of the ghg protocol

dieselpowered electricmotordriven hybrid railcars and the accumulator railcar train
the kiha e200 type cars which entered service on the koumi line in july 2007 are the world       s first
dieselpowered electricmotordriven hybrid railcars compared with the current trains fuel consumption
rate has been reduced by about 10 and the noise level of the trains idling at stations and accelerating
on departure has been lowered by 2030 db also starting from the october to december 2010 we
began operating the hbe300 series a new type of resort train equipped with a hybrid system similar
to the kiha e200 type in the nagano aomori and akita areas additionally as a new measure toward
reduction of the environmental burden in nonelectric zones we are proceeding with the development
of an accumulator system which debuted in march 2014 with the eve301 accum railcar train put into
service on the karasuyama line the introduction of the eve301 has enabled an elimination of emissions
as well as a reduction in co2 and noise emissions associated with diesel engines

utilization of renewable energies
we also promote use of renewable energies including solar and wind power solar panels have been
installed at tokyo station takasaki station the general education center and rd center in march
2004 the number of panels at takasaki station was doubled panels on the largest scale in jr east were
installed at tokyo station in february 2011 above the platform for tracks 9 and 10 which serve tokaido
line trains

starting full operations as the first ecoste 
of solar panels in march 2012 hiraizumi station on the jr east tohoku main line the second ecoste
began to use solar panels in june 2012 togenerate and use energy locallyand to achievezero
emissionsie no co2 emissions on fineweather days additionally the largest solar panels employed
anywhere at our company have been installed at the keiyo rolling stock center these have been in use
since february 2014
we will continue to endeavor to introduce technology using renewable energies efficiently

greening rooftops
we have been promoting the planting of greenery on jr east station and office building rooftops with the
aim of reducing the heat island effect and decreasing the need for air conditioning as of the end of march
2014 we had completed 73 greening projects including some cases of moss planting encompassing a
combined rooftop area of approximately 25173 m2

rooftop greening by jr group companies
we have been promoting rooftop greening to make station buildings in the metropolitan area a place of
relaxation for community residents as well as for office workers thesoradofarm   which is a vegetable
farm rented to subscribers and built alongside the gardens serves to create a local community and
provides education in farming and environment through people      s experience in cultivating vegetables

saving energy in office buildings
in response to revisions of laws and regulations saving energy in office buildings has become increasingly
important we work hard on reducing energy consumption through physical measures including the
introduction of highly efficient equipment and facilities and operational measures including temperature
management of air conditioning and diligently turning off lights
in addition given the concerns about energy supply and demand since the great east japan earthquake
we have been actively introducing led lighting apparatus which is particularly effective as a physical
measure




environmentally friendly and energy efficient office buildings
construction was completed in fy2013 on the jr minami shinjuku building jr kanda manseibashi
building and jp tower which are all environmentally friendly and energy efficient buildings the jr kanda
manseibashi building and jp tower have acquired a class s rating the highest rating under the casbee

 measures to create a sound material cycle
 waste reduction and recycling
 jr east generates many kinds of waste through its railway operations including daily trash removed from
 trains and stations and industrial waste from our general rolling stock centers in addition restaurants
 and retail stores in our lifestyle businesses produce garbage and general waste
 in order to reduce all these various forms of waste jr east actively supports the approach known as
reduce reuse recyclefor recycling in particular goals are set for each type of waste



                                                                            
 recycling waste collected from stations and trains
 in the fiscal year ended march 2014 94 of the trash collected from stations and trains was recycled
 since trash from stations and trains contains recyclable materials we first placed separation bins
 in stations we then established recycling centers in ueno omiya and shinkiba for more rigorous
 separation in october 2010 to further improve recycling rates we consolidated the recycling centers in
 ueno and shinkiba and built the jr east tokyo materials recycling center operated by east japan eco

hometown forestation program
in 2004 in order to protect biodiversity and contribute to a sustainable society while cherishing our
sense of gratitude to nature we began the hometown forestation programs to plant trees native to each
region and revitalize the forests
we undertook these programs with the cooperation of fukushima prefecture from 2004 to 2009 and with
the cooperation of niigata prefecture and the towns of tsunanmachi and tokamachi in 2010 in addition
in other areas served by jr east we are planting trees that are native to the areas and we shall continue
to do the same in the future

forest development along railway lines
beginning in 1992 we have been organizing tree planting activities along jr east railway lines by fy2014
a total of approximately 47 thousand people had participated in planting about 324 thousand trees
today planting has gone beyond the trackside and is done in cooperation with local communities



development of railway trees
along some jr east railway lines we have planted railway trees to shield the tracks from blowing snow
and wind the first railway trees were created in 1893 for disaster prevention as living disaster prevention
facilities railway forests are playing their roles
jr east now owns approximately 58 million railway trees on a total of about 4000 hectares along our
lines at approximately 1200 locations the trees absorb 16 thousand tons of co2  equivalent to 06 of
the co2 that jr east emits in this way they also contribute to preserving the environment
in 2008 after fundamentally reviewing the role of railway trees from the viewpoints of both disaster
prevention and environmental preservation we launched a new project to plant trees to replace those
that will require replacement over the coming 20 years

railway treesfrom single to multivariety forests
traditionally railway trees were of a single variety primarily cedar trees because another function in
addition to protecting against natural disasters was to generate profits through the production of timber
this has recently been less successful however as the demand for domestic timber has declined in
future tree replacement we will plant several varieties suitable for the local climate and develop them to
be more sustainable and ecologically resilient

on the tazawako line on september 29 2012 and in the sekine no 1 railway forest on the ou main line
between sekine and yonezawa on september 28 2013 with kind advice and guidance from ecologist
and professor emeritus akira miyawaki of yokohama national university several varieties of native trees
potential natural vegetation or pnv were selected and planted many local residents and participants
from organized tours took part in the ceremonies and discovered how the trees they planted would grow
to become useful as living railway disaster prevention facilities

basic thoughts on noise reduction
improvement of the environment along railways basic thoughts on noise reduction
in the operation of trains noise is created by the train cars moving through the air by the wheels
travelling on the rails by the motors and by other sources in order to reduce noise we are working in
various ways to improve both the trains and our ground equipment
jr east also endeavors to reduce noise during maintenance work on track and structures to further
improve the lineside environment



measures for the shinkansen
in accordance with the japanese government         s environmental quality standards for shinkansen
superexpress railway noise jr east has taken many steps to reduce this noise such as the installation
of soundproof walls and soundabsorbent materials rail grinding1 and the modification of our railcars to
operate more quietly we have already completed the implementation of measures to reduce noise levels
to 75 db or lower in densely populated residential areas along our railway lines and we plan to take
further steps by expanding the scope of areas where noise levels need to be reduced to 75 db or lower
also with the introduction of e5 series railcars which were developed based on the results of running
tests using the shinkansenfastechtest train jr east is working to improve the environment even as
we increase train speed including further reduction of noise and micropressure waves in tunnels2
1 rail grinding a measure to smooth out uneven places in rails caused by wheels traveling over them this reduces noise by controlling car
   vibration
2 micropressure waves in tunnels an explosive sound caused by compressed air being forced




                                         e5 series trains have lownoise pantographs

we have implemented voluntary measures for conventional lines to minimize noise installing long rails1 and
performing railgrinding and wheeltruing2 we also comply with the japanese government      s policy on
noise measures for construction of new conventional railways or largescale remodeling when we
engage in this kind of construction or modification of our conventional lines
1 installing long rails rail joints are welded such that the length of a single rail becomes more than 200 meters with fewer rail joints these
   rails reduce noise produced at joints when trains pass
2 wheel truing a measure to grind the unevenness of wheels caused by wear to restore their circular shape




measures for maintenance work
as the maintenance work is usually done during night we give advance notice about the schedule and
details of the work to residents in surrounding areas we also make utmost efforts to minimize noise by
using modified equipment that produces lower noise furthermore by using track that is designed to
resist deformation jr east is reducing the volume of required maintenance work




                                                                       38

improvement of the environment along railway lines
restricting use of herbicides
safe train operations require regular removal of weeds along railway lines while we generally remove
them manually we also use a certain amount of herbicide we keep the usage of herbicides to a
minimum in both volume and range of use when selecting herbicides for use we select those from the
safest of the three levels of toxicity to humans and animals and from category a the safest of the five
levels of toxicity to fish
we continue to observe the rules in place in order to keep our impact on the surrounding environment
to a minimum as with our initiative to postpone the spraying of herbicides when conditions on the
scheduled day are not satisfactory for spraying



harmony with the landscape
given that construction of a largescale railway facility or its remodeling greatly affects the local area
and surrounding environment jr east endeavors to harmonize its completed facilities with surrounding
landscapes and natural environments in the fiscal year ended in march 2012 agatsumagawa bridge no
3 received the tanaka award for excellent bridge work or bridge engineering from the japan society
of civil engineers in recognition of a landscape in harmony with the surrounding environment and the
national road parallel to the bridge our efforts are indeed well recognized outside of the company

chemical substance management
compliance with laws and regulations and setting goals for reduction of chemical substances
when using chemical substances the effects on human health and ecological systems must be fully
considered the jr east group not only rigidly adheres to established standard values but sets its
own ambitious targets as well as much as possible we restrict the use of such substances and adopt
substitutes that have less impact on the environment



                                                                                                               
reducing and replacing ozone depleting substances
we endeavor to reduce the use of substances specified as controlled substances under the ozone layer
protection law and adopt substitutes that have less impact on the environment
 large heat exchangers large cooling unitshaving steadily replaced air conditioning units using
  specified chlorofluorocarbons cfcs with systems that do not use them we completed the removal of
  such units from buildings by the end of fy2008
 rolling stockexcept for some diesel railcars all of our cars use cfc substitutes as of the end of
  fy2014 we were using 12 tons of cfcs and 88 tons of cfc substitutes we routinely check for gas
  leaks and collect the refrigerants when scrapping retired railcars in accordance with applicable laws
  and regulations
 fireextinguishing agentalthough 66 tons of halon gas was still in use as a fireextinguishing agent as of
  the end of fy2014 we have it under proper control and are replacing it with nonhalon agents such as
  powder agents and co2 when building new facilities or renovating existing ones




                                                                    
chemical substance management
as jr east uses chemical substances primarily for painting and repairing our railcars we take rigorous
steps for their use and management in order to prevent spills we are a company that handles a certain
amount of specified chemical substances and 15 jr east facilities submitted the data regarding the
release and transfer of these substances to relevant authorities in fy2014 pursuant to the prtr system
we have also been introducing stainless steel railcars that do not require painting at the end of fy2014
as many as 83 of the 10894 cars operated on our conventional lines were stainless steel railcars
beside their use for railcars we used 575 tons of organic solvents for painting railway facilities and
stabilizing track beds in fy2014
 prtr system a system where companies notify their releases and transfers of chemical substances as required by the prtr law it
  encourages the monitoring and control of toxic chemical substances emitted into the environment and measures to prevent negative
  impact on the environment

thorough management of chemical substances
jr east is working to establish a system to prevent environmental accidents by more rigidly managing
chemical substances we prepared emergency response manuals for onsite locations such as our thermal
power plants and general rolling stock centers that handle chemical and hazardous substances we are
also preparing ourselves to respond properly to any contingencies by holding workshops and training
sessions on how to handle these substances and ensuring that related information reaches all concerned
personnel


compliance with environmental laws and regulations
there were no major violations of environmentrelated laws and regulations resulting in penalties in
fy2014

using environmental management indicators
in fy2014 our environmental conservation costs amounted to approximately 130 billion yen in
investments and 127 billion yen in expenses
of these investments costs for global environmental conservation which accounted for a large portion
were at the same level as the previous year because we continued acquiring new railcars
by introducing these new cars we estimate we will reduce co2 emissions by 249 thousand tons during
their service lives
jr east has its own environmental management indicator to assess the relation between our business
activities and environmental impacts these are calculated by dividing co2 emissions which are a major
factor in our environmental impacts by operating profits which represent our economic value added
a smaller value of the indicator means that we are making a smaller impact on the environment to create
the same economic value added for fy2014 the value of the indicator was 655tco 2 million yen
compared with 945tco2 million yen for fy1991

                 accum
accumulator system
as a new measure toward reduction of the environmental burden in nonelectric zones
we developed an experimental train ne train smart denchi kun featuring a battery
drive train system the result of our efforts was the start of operation of the eve301
accum train on the karasuyama line in march 2014 the eve301 series cars have an
accumulator for the main circuit enabling them to operate in nonelectrified zones on
electrified sections the train raises its pantograph to receive power for operation and for
charging the accumulator when the train enters a nonelectrified zone the pantograph
is lowered and the train operates on accumulated power alone when the brakes are
applied regenerated power is used to charge the accumulator which can also be
recharged at terminal stations where rapidrecharging facilities have been installed
the introduction of the eve301 series has made possible the elimination of exhaust
emissions and reductions in co2 and noise emission levels from those generated by
diesel engines

largescale solar power generation facility
jr east launched operation of its first largescale solar power generation facility  with
an output capacity of 1050kw  on the grounds of the keiyo rolling stock center on
february 28 2014 the electricity generated will be used at the center and will also
help to operate trains by sending power to overhead lines with the aim of reducing our
co2 emissions the megasolar plant will generate about 1000 mwh per year and is
expected to reduce co2 emissions by about 500 tons annually
we will begin operation of a 4mwclass largescale solar power generation facility
between tomobe and uchihara on the joban line within fy2015 going forward we will
look at the establishment of additional solar power generation facirities on our own sites
while contributing to the spread and promotion of renewable energy

extreme safety levelsand build a railway capable of withstanding natural disasters in order to achieve
 this we will continue our ceaseless efforts to increase the safety of our railways
 when the great east japan earthquake occurred the earthquake countermeasures that jr east had
 already been steadily implementing proved effective to a great extent however the earthquake also
 revealed issues that we must address to ensure a higher level of safety based on this experience we
 have worked to implement earthquake countermeasures in preparation for events that are conceivable
 such as an earthquake directly beneath the tokyo metropolitan area and are focusing on both tangible
 and intangible aspects in these ways we are working to build a railway capable of withstanding natural
 disasters
 we are also further promoting initiatives to prevent train collisions derailments and rail crossing
 accidents at the same time we are installing automatic platform gates for the yamanote line and
 exploring the possibility of installation for other lines in these and other ways we continue to promote
 the development of railways that passengers can use reliably from fy2015 we will also bolster activities
 aimed at achievingextreme safety levelsbased on our newly formulated group safety plan 2018



 group safety plan 2018 our 6th 5year safety plan
 since our establishment jr east has continued to create and implement medium term safety plans with
 the installation and further development of our safety equipment along with companywide advancements
 in safety awareness and skill we have succeeded in reducing the frequency of railway accidents
 drastically from levels at the time of the company s establishment fy2015 begins our 6th 5year safety
 plan group safety plan 2018 aimed at expanding the individual capabilities of each employee in order
 to realize top levels of safety through teamwork each of us involved in the railway business remains

installing safety equipment
to prevent collisions between trains jr east has installed ats automatic train stop and atc automatic
train control systems on all of its railway lines to heighten the current safety level of train operations
even further we are installing atsp and atsps systems which employ continuous speed monitoring
functions the number of installations is steadily increasing most are in the tokyo metropolitan area
by the end of march 2014 the atsp system had been installed on 24061 km of railway line the ats
ps system is currently installed on 2105 km of line in the sendai and niigata regions and at 64 stations
additionally jr east replaced the atsps on the section of the senseki line between aobadori and
higashishiogama with its advanced train administration and communications system atacs a radio
controlled train operation control system in october of 2011
in response to revisions to the ministry ordinance for technological standards for railways in july 2006
we are working on measures to prevent excessive train speeds at curves turnouts and terminals and on
descending grades planned improvements at all curves that had been targeted for action were completed
by the end of march 2010

introduction of the advanced train administration and communications system atacs
train control system with radio transmission
atacs is a train control system utilizing radio transmissions by using radio communications for the
transmission of information between ground and onboard facilities the system enables the trains to be
mainly controlled by onboard equipment permitting reductions in traditionally required facilities such as
signals connecting cables and track circuits which are currently used for the detection of trains
eliminating these facilities is expected to reduce the number of facility failures and the number of
subsequent transport disruptions
jr east began using the atacs system in october 2011 on the senseki line between aobadori and
higashishiogama in december 2012 as one of our 2nd stage functions jr east released a new function
for setting provisional speed limits from 2014 onwards we plan to release another new function for
controlling road traffic at level crossings

systemization of maintenance work
when starting maintenance work on railway tracks jr east works to ensure the safety of its trains and
maintenance workers by following procedures to set signals to red so that trains do not enter sections of
railway where maintenance work is being conducted in the past this was done mainly via telephone from
maintenance workers to stations however in order to prevent any occurrence of error including human
error jr east adopted a method for maintenance workers to operate handheld devices to change signals
to red and the devices have since been introduced to major railway sections in the tokyo metropolitan
area in the future jr east aims to continue its efforts to improve the safety of its operations through the
systemization of its maintenance work in other railway sections as well

introduction ofeffective rainfallas a new indicator
when there is heavy rainfall we ensure train safety through operational restrictions such as limits to train
speed and when necessary by suspension of operations for operational restrictions on conventional
lines we have been using hourly rainfall1 and continuous precipitation2 as our indices since june 2008
we have been usingeffective rainfallas a new indicator that is effective in prevention of landslide
disasters due to rainfall effective rainfall is the amount of underground water remaining after changes
over time in ground penetration and outflow using this indicator we can more precisely predict the
occurrence of landslide disasters improving the safety and reliability of our train operations
1 hourly rainfall the total rainfall over a onehour period
2 continuous precipitation the total continuous rainfall over a 12hour period

measures to prevent accidents at rail crossings
when the company was established in 1987 there were 247 accidents during the year at rail crossings
with roads in fy2014 the number had been drastically reduced to 36 approximately 60 of all rail
crossing accidents involve automobiles we have installed devices such as obstacle detectors which are
capable of detecting an obstacle such as an automobile stalled on a crossing and stopping trains and
we have increased the number of crossing warning devices in a higher position for better visibility larger
crossing gates have been installed the barrier arms are thicker than usual these are expected to provide
better visibility day and night we are also promoting a wide range of public relations activities for the
prevention of rail crossing accidents appealing to drivers for their cooperation and understanding
in addition for countermeasures against secondary accidents resulting from derailments at level crossings
with roads derailment prevention guards have been installed at these crossings the longterm solution
is to decrease the number of rail crossings and we are cooperating with local governments neighboring
residents and the police to increase the number of overhead crossings
as examples of our most recent efforts in 2005 jr east began working to improve safety at the sojiji
temple rail crossing on the tokaido line near tsurumi station where there had been more trouble than
at other rail crossings in the tokyo area because it is on a curve with limited visibility the overhead
pedestrian crossing was rebuilt to be barrierfree and in fy2011 the rail crossing was closed during
rush hours closed hours were extended to between 600 and 2100 in fy2012 and as a result of our
agreements with concerned parties from april 1 2012 this rail crossing has been closed to road traffic at
all times
learning lessons from an accident at a rail crossing on the iiyama line between morimiyanohara and
ashidaki on february 1 2011 jr east has introduced a rule to stop trains at stations when the warning
signals at a crossing are being activated due to causes such as equipment failures and when pedestrians
and automobiles are allowed to use the crossing to ensure that train operations do not endanger
pedestrians or automobiles jr east also formulated a procedure for field staff to prevent failures in safety
confirmation

station platform safety
in fy2014 there were 88 accidents in which customers fell from platforms onto tracks or came into
contact with trains jr east is installing protectionrelated devices including emergency trainstop systems
on our platforms to ensure customer safety customer awareness and cooperation are also vital to safety
on our platforms and we are implementing ourzero platform accident campaignthrough posters as a
measure to heighten this awareness
as a major measure to prevent accidents involving customers on platforms jr east is introducing
automatic platform gates on the yamanote line in fy2014 we started the use of these gates at otsuka
sugamo komagome shinokubo mejiro takadanobaba and tamachi stations in fy2015 we plan to
install these gates at okachimachi uguisudani tabata yurakucho harajuku gotanda and nishi nippori
stations with the exception of six stations shinagawa hamamatsucho shimbashi shibuya shinjuku
and tokyo stations which require largescale improvement work we plan to complete installations at
all stations on the line by fy2016 for routes other than the yamanote line we plan to install automatic
platform gates mainly at stations used frequently by visually challenged customers while discussing these
matters with concerned organizations
for stations where the daily number of passengers exceeds 100000 jr east is currently working to install
an increased number of dotbraille blocks that indicate which direction is away from the edge of the
platform

measures against earthquakes
measures learned from past earthquakes
learning from earthquakes in the past jr east has employed the following three antiearthquake
measures
① stopping trains immediately emergency train stop measures
② preventing structural damage seismic reinforcement measures
③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment preventive measures against derailed trains
  leaving the track area


① stopping trains immediately emergency train stop measures
jr east has installed seismographs along coastal and shinkansen railway lines for the detection of primary
tremors pwaves our present system allows us to stop trains as soon as primary tremors are detected
from august 2012 to be better prepared for possible earthquakes jr east additionally installed and
started using seismometers at 30 locations for earthquakes with epicenters directly beneath the tokyo
metropolitan area and those in inland sections of its service area in october 2012 jr east began using
earthquake early warning from the japan meteorological agency for conventional lines our early
earthquake alert system was introduced for the tokyo metropolitan area in december 2007 and in all
other areas in april 2009 the system enables trains in any section of tracks to be stopped in the case
of a major earthquake utilizing information obtained from our shinkansen seismographs and from any
advance announcements given by the japan meteorological agency


② preventing structural damage seismic reinforcement measures
in response to the 1995 great hanshinawaji earthquake jr east has been taking a number of seismic
reinforcement measures by the end of march 2008 we had reinforced all of our elevated shinkansen
viaduct support columns and shinkansen bridge columns on our conventional lines by the end of march
2009 we had reinforced all other columns in the southern kanto and sendai areas except in places that
required additional construction work currently we are reinforcing elevated bridge columns susceptible
to failure due to bending by strong earthquake motion aiming to further improve our safety levels
against earthquakes beginning in fy2013 to prepare for a possible earthquake directly beneath the
tokyo metropolitan area we have been making seismic reinforcement of embankments cuttings brick
arch viaducts electrical poles and other infrastructure other initiatives include countermeasures against
collapse of station ceilings and walls and platform roofs and preparing advanced plans for the seismic
reinforcement of viaduct support columns and bridge columns based on experience derived from the
great east japan earthquake we will proceed with the seismic reinforcement of railway station buildings
serving more than 3000 passengers per day along with the seismic reinforcement of shinkansen
electrical poles



③ minimizing secondary accidents following derailment
  preventive measures against derailed trains leaving the track area
during the niigata chuetsu earthquake in 2004 one of our joetsu shinkansen trains was derailed while
running fortunately this derailment did not lead to any injury to either our passengers or our train crew
learning from the events surrounding this earthquake jr east has taken several measures for our
shinkansen trains and tracks for our railcars we have installed an lshaped car guide on the bogies
to restrict lateral movement of the car body by august 2008 we had completed the installation of
lshaped car guides on all shinkansen railcars for ground facilities we are currently improving the shape
of joint bars to lessen the impact of wheels on rail joints in the case of derailment and implementing
countermeasures to prevent the overturning and lateral movement of rails if metal rail fasteners are
damaged by a derailed train we implemented all planned measures for all shinkansen sections in
fy2012

measures taken since the accident on the uetsu line
on december 25 2005 the limited express train inaho no14 derailed between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations near the no 2 mogamigawa bridge we would like to report on the measures we
have taken since this accident


increased number of anemometers wind meters
jr east has increased the number of anemometers at the accident site between sagoshi and kita
amarume stations in addition for sections with operational restrictions when there are strong winds we
established multiple anemometers as our new standard and increased the number of anemometers in
locations where windbreak fences were installed by reconfirming the requirements for wind restrictions
on sections of railway lines using information from frontline employees topography and wind conditions
of the areas and adding new operation restriction sections we are working to improve our safety
observation network to counter the effects of these strong winds with this reinforcement since the
accident jr east has installed a total of 622 anemometers for its conventional and shinkansen lines
and as of march 31 2014 we had 939 anemometers installed 781 on conventional lines and 158 on
shinkansen lines
                                                                                                  as of mar 31 2014

expanded introduction of a gale warning system
we have been adding to our gale warning system to raise the level of safety by restricting operations
not only when the actual wind speed measured by anemometers exceeds restriction thresholds but
also when the projected maximum wind speed exceeds these limits jr east has installed gale warning
systems in all of the 299 locations on its conventional lines with gale operational restrictions


introduction of a method to properly assess the effect of wind force on railcars for
operational restrictions
the effect of wind force on railcars is constantly changing for this reason jr east has been studying
methods to properly assess the effects of wind on railcars and utilize the results to more accurately
impose operational restrictions for increased safety in train operations together with consideration for
the opinions of experts in the field jr east has been studying the following
① more accurate methods of wind observation using anemometers
② calculation methods for the yield strength of railcars against wind through consideration of track
   conditions and car body shape
jr east introduced each of these new methods to some sections of the uetsu main line the keiyo line
and the echigo line and the second measure to all sections of the ominato line


utilizing meteorological information to test methods for operational restrictions
local gusts are meteorological phenomena and are difficult to observe with conventional observation
equipment such as anemometers through meteorological information obtained from the japan
meteorological agency radar and by detecting the passing of cold weather fronts and the accompanying
development of cumulonimbus clouds we have been investigating how to forecast the occurrence of
local gusts and to apply that information to our operational restrictions from fy2008 the system was
tested during the winter on the uetsu main line between niitsu and sakata and on the hakushin line
between niigata and shibata on february 17 2009 we added the system to sections of the uetsu main
line shinetsu main line echigo line yahiko line and rikuu west line for additional testing additionally
from fy2013 we have added the japan meteorological agency          s nowcast that supports detection of
tornados as a condition for issuing alarms for our train operations
during this 7 year period of testing though we initiated train operational restrictions for a total of 20 days
we did not observe any actual occurrence of local gusts


research of a doppler radar observation method
we are currently investigating the possible utilization of a doppler radar observation method to help
identify local gusts as information to be used for operational restrictions doppler radars can determine
wind conditions by detecting the movements of raindrops and rain clouds and are used at some airports
for detecting local gusts
since 2007 we have been conducting local gust observations using a doppler radar installed at amarume
station on the uetsu main line in 2010 we constructed a prototype of the local gust detection system
and began realtime local gust detection experiments we plan to continue our experimental monitoring
with this system conducting validations and improvements and further advancing our research on the
potential applicability of the system for train operation restrictions

service quality
jr east setsservice quality reformas one of the eternal missions in itsjr east group management
vision vand views the reform as an important pillar in business management in order to become a
group that is chosen by customers and local communities jr east will strive to reform service quality with
a crossdivisional and crosssectional teamwork to attain the highest customer satisfaction unequaled in
the railway industry specifically we will further improve ourtransport qualityby preventing transport
disruptions resuming train operation quickly after disruptions minimizing the effects of disruptions and
enhancing information communication we will also improve the economic situation of every lineside area
will offer services which elderly customers can use comfortably and ensure that we have a customer
friendly railway service through various measures to prevent injuries and crimes




    quality services that reassure customers

prevention of transport disruptions early resumption of operations after transport
disruptions and prevention of disruptions to connecting lines
we are implementing various measures to improve transport quality by striving to prevent transport
disruptions and by stepping up early resumption of operations after transport disruptions as well as
preventing disruptions impacting on connecting lines
we continue to implement expanded introduction of railcars with dual systems and installation of track
switches of nextgeneration design making equipment failure less likely measures to prevent lightning
strike damage to electric facilities and other disruption countermeasures
for early resumption of operations we maintain efforts to enhance our postdisruption response abilities
by such measures as drills to deal with accidents resulting in casualties and rescuing passengers notably
concerning accidents resulting in casualties cooperation with police and fire services is important and
we thus implement drills etc for employees jointly with police and fire services on a regular basis in
addition we try to turn trains back before they enter the disrupted section or operate other routes
wherever possible in an effort to minimize the impact on customers
when a disruption has occurred each worksite involved reflects on how it was dealt with learns the
lessons from this and uses the knowledge to study and implement measures to prevent recurrences
which are then widely disseminated inhouse to raise the level of each and every employee
 railcars with dual systems railcars with increased reliability through duplication of major equipment

 information enhancement
 for better information provision in an emergency jr east is taking steps to provide our customers with
 more accurate information by having the anticipated time at which operations should resume announced
 within ten minutes of a suspension of operations following an accident that caused casualties and giving
 subsequent updates depending on the situation in addition as tools for providing transport information
 we continued to install emergency information displays installed at 186 stations as of march 2014 as
 well as enhancing display functions such as displaying in four languages and showing information on
 turnback operations disruptions on other lines and other events we also provide information through
 various media such as onboard led and liquid crystal displays the jr east and other websites and the
 contents of cell phone carriers
 in addition on our website we commenced distribution of information on service suspensions of
 conventional line limited express trains etc and extended the time that delay certificates can be issued
 on major lines in the tokyo metropolitan area furthermore for smartphones we commencedjr east
 train operation information push notificationa service for notifying information on train operations on
 our conventional and shinkansen lines for 12 lines in the tohoku area we started operatingdokotrain
 a train operation information service that enables customers to confirm the operating status of individual
 trains by using their computers or smartphones

  pursuit of customerfriendly railway services

baby stroller safety measures
to increase safety for customers with baby strollers who use our stations and trains we have been
working to improve the detection ability of railcar doors in the event that baby stroller frames etc get
caught in addition supporting the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourisms baby stroller
campaign we have been putting up posters etc from may 2014 to urge customers with baby strollers
to be careful as well as asking customers with baby strollers and other customers to give way to each
other when boarding trains we also collaborated with the tokyo metropolitan government and railway
companies in kanto region in holding asafe use of baby stroller class in teppakuat the railway
museum on may 20 2014 in which about 1000 visitors took part and enjoyed learning about safe
railway use of baby strollers

escalator safety measures
to prevent injuries to customers when they use escalators we are carrying out safety enhancements
including measures that will prevent sandals from getting caught prevent falls during emergency stops
and prevent steps from descending when escalators stop in addition we are also working together with
other railway companies retailers and other facilities to carry out campaigns in an effort to draw the
attention of customers through such means as posters and handing out free pocket tissues that call for
the safe and proper use of escalators
campaigns have been underway since july 2014 continuing an ongoing effort to concentrate people       s
attention upon the proper use of escalators and upon caring for those customers who due to injury or
various other reasons are able to stand only on the right side of the escalator steps which are normally
used by people who are walking while on the escalator we are trying to make the content easily
understood by all ages from young to old in addition to railway operators this time those involved with
office buildings shopping centers and the jr east group are collaborating in the production and use of
these campaign posters due to the area coverage of corporate partners being expanded nationwide in
the campaigns

prompt service quality improvements with customer comments at the core
customer comments are considered at various levels within the company initially a decision as to
whether or not some action of improvement is possible is made at the level that initially received the
original customer comments the action will reflect this decision if action is difficult to take at that level
then the comments are passed on to higher levels where potential improvements can be discussed
at the very top level we have also established the customer comments committee chaired by the
president which considers the possible implementation of improvement measures based on collected
customer comments through this system we are constantly striving for the attainment of improved
customer services

customer satisfaction surveys
we conduct customer satisfaction surveys via our jr east customer questionnaires to enable us to gain
an understanding of how customers evaluate our services that we cannot get simply through customer
feedback and to quantitatively check levels of customer satisfaction the survey results are used to decide
which issues jr east should most urgently address as well as to confirm the efficacy of previous measures


railway line wayside monitors
we instituted a wayside monitors system beginning in fy2012 to gain a more specific understanding
of the needs of our customers and of the way they use our services on each of our railway lines this
is in addition to customerscomments we receive daily and our jr east customer questionnaires we
have recruited the monitors from among our customers who live along our railway lines and sought their
views through questionnaires on the internet and interviews to understand their needs from different
perspectives so that we can increase the attractiveness of living alongside or near our railway lines
surveyed sections the yokohama saikyo and keiyo lines in the fiscal year ended march 2012 the
musashino line in the fiscal year ended march 2013 the joban line in the fiscal year ended march 2014
and the takasaki line in the fiscal year ending march 2015


projects for improving service quality

service quality and transmit information has begun on the musashino line and saikyo line in march 2013
and on the yokohama line in june we will continue to work to improve service quality in light of the
needs and characteristics of each area along our railway lines and provide information about our service
quality reforms via various media

ascertaining what they really need we therefore strive to discover their potential opinions by making use
of social media thejr east official facebook   launched in may 2012 provides information about our
various campaigns and proposals

needs we learn about customersdemands from their comments and use this information to develop
specific improvements it is through such twoway communications with our customers that we endeavor
to upgrade our service quality



sq network
due to prompt improvements in the quality of our services that reflect customer comments with the
entire group working as a single team our company and group companies closely involved in transport
service established the sq service quality network in october 2011 the sq network holds meetings
of representatives of jr east and group companies at stations branch offices and the head office to share
customerscomments and devise solutions and improvements through teamwork that goes beyond
individual departments or group companies in this way the jr east group as a whole can dedicate itself
to enhancing customerssatisfaction

for providing reliable railway transport we stationed service quality coordinators in district and branch
offices beginning in october 2011 the coordinator    s job is to supervise the areawide improvement of
service quality as well as to support and promote solution of crossorganizational problems in this way
efforts will be made to improve service quality rapidly from the frontline field operations



service quality meetings
to improve our service quality further with field operations branch offices and the head office working
as a team we instituted service quality meetings in which senior executives from our head office visit
field operations and exchange views with field supervisors in the fiscal year ended march 2014 with
improvement of satisfaction by each area along our railway lines set as the main theme each branch
      s tasks were selected as subthemes and discussions were underway on the subthemesstatus quo

area and strives to improve quality of service by means of teamwork without being constrained by the
organizational framework of the company

toward opening of the hokuriku shinkansen
in preparation for the opening of the hokuriku shinkansen line we set uphokuriku sales
centerour first domestic office outside of the jr east service area in kanazawa in april 2013
here we are mainly working on promoting development of communitybased tourism and
creating products for travel from the tokyo metropolitan area to hokuriku specifically we
are joining forces with local governments jr west other transportation business operators
business facilities along railway lines to prepare secondary transportation services and to find
and refine the region s tourism aspects we are also making efforts to promote the development
of tourism routes covering a wide area including niigata nagano and gifu prefectures by
enhancing tourism and other attractive aspects of the region we can generate more travel and
exchangefrom tokyo to hokurikuandfrom hokuriku to tokyoleading to the development
of winwin relationships



uenotokyo line tohoku through line
the uenotokyo line is a project to add two tracks to the section from ueno station to tokyo
station which will allow trains from the utsunomiya and takasaki lines and the joban line
which terminate at ueno station to continue to tokyo station for direct service to the tokaido
line the level of intrain congestion between ueno and okachimachi on the keihintohoku and
yamanote lines during morning commuting hours is about 200 a level that leaves no room
to move during rush hours but the opening of the uenotokyo line is expected to ease the
congestion to 180 or lower in addition travel time will also be shortened because transfers
at ueno station and tokyo station will no longer be necessary for many passengers in terms
of economics enhancing the transport network connecting the tokyo metropolitan area to
the north and south will stimulate mutual exchange between the areas along the utsunomiya
takasaki and joban lines and the areas along the tokaido line leading to regional revitalization
the opening of the uenotokyo line is planned at march 2015

 yoshino allowing train crew to carry tablet computers means regulations emergency manuals etc can now
         all be managed on tablets making updating and management very easy this is a great advantage
 koyama i think it
                  s also a great advantage that with regulations etc all available via tablets the materials
        are now easily portable and we can retrieve search and browse them immediately when needed
        however from a manager     s perspective we were very careful to take measures against possible
        loss of the tablets because some of the information in them is confidential as we are now
        preparing for their use in field operations we are thoroughly reviewing management methods so
        we can instantly identify to whom tablets have been lent out
                                  yoshino among us in charge of instruction too we sorted out the
                                          materials to install by discussing what kind of information should
                                          be input and what kind of apps would be effective
                                  koyama i would like to see that train crew are thoroughly informed and kept
                                          up to date through training on what kind of information is in the
                                          tablets and what kind of impact may arise in the event of loss
                                     yoshino our use of tablets is viewed positively by many in that it broadens
                                                the scope in which we can serve our customers and allows us
                                                to provide increasingly enriched services there have already
                                                been cases where problems experienced onthejob have been
                                                documented in a manner that
 takashi koyama                                 is easily understood by train
 assistant depot chief                          crew and shared on tablets and
 chiba conductors depot                         the tablets are proving useful in
                                                serving customers
            furthermore based on feedback from train crew on the front lines
            transfer advice disaster information and translation are three kinds
            of applications that were introduced after hearinghaving such apps
            would helpmost staff probably feel the increasing potential of
            using tablet computers
 koyama indeed young employees in particular are continually askingcan
        this be doneso our intentions are to increasingly incorporate
        ideas from the field                                                    masato yoshino
                                                                              senior chief conductor
 yoshino on the day that the kanto region was hit by heavy snowfall
                                                                               conductor coach
         there was an incident where bamboo had fallen on and partially
                                                                              chiba conductors depot
         blocked the railway tracks if we had just told this to customers
         they would still be wondering aboutwhen will operations resumewe found that distributing
         onsite photos to the tablets of conductors on stalled trains so that conductors could then show
         customersthis is whats happenedgave those customers more assurance
 koyama that is a good example of improving customer service quality in the field through quick thinking
        and utilizing tablets
 yoshino i
          ve heard there have been other cases using tablets such
         as researching tokyo disney resort admission restrictions
         and other information alerting customers to things like
         this by intrain announcements or using tablets to inform
         customers about connections to other railways and about
         the weather
 koyama looking ahead our intentions are to keep improving
        the quality of information provided for example we
        are considering whether information can be transmitted
        via tablet email onsite photos and messages planned
        operations on days following major transport disruptions
        and rain and wind forecasts are some of the various
        kinds of information we want to continue considering ways we can serve our customers more
        specifically by having such information mailed to tablets for viewing by the train crew in charge so
        that they can use the information to better serve customers

                                             i can get the items that i liked when traveling even in tokyo
 be purchased just by stopping by after work
       s nostalgic to find products that are a specialty of the
 andit
 prefecture where i was born
 the ultimate goal of this store is to communicate the attractiveness
 of eastern japan through local food found atnomonohave
 people in the tokyo metropolitan area feel that theywant to visit
 the site firsthandand then actually travel to that region
 as store manager it is my desire to have staff themselves increase
 their knowledge of the products and becomeconcierges for
 eastern japanwho can confidently suggest and introduce
 products to customers in addition i also think it is my role to
 mount efforts to nurture staff so that manufacturers and farmers
 can feel at ease in entrusting their products with us
 there are still many food and local delicacies in each eastern
 japan region waiting to be found that we have yet to discover
 and introduce in the store intentions are to keep searching
 for products characteristic of regional areas that are yet to be
 found to form a unique selection of products so that we can
 communicate the attractiveness of eastern japan more and more
 to everyone in the tokyo metropolitan area                            hiroko mizuno

relationship with employees

   demonstrating the power of human resources

in order to ensure safe and reliable rail transport and provide services that will satisfy customers it
is vitally important for us to create an environment where jr east     s personnel can fully exercise their
abilities our success in enabling our people to be able to personally decide what they need to achieve
and then act on their decisions will determine the future of our entire organization
we also have to face the fact that society is in a continual state of change and this includes both
the awareness of working people and their working environments as a result of this we believe that
jr east must constantly respond to the motivation of all our employees as they work to meet their
responsibilities and thereby bring about improved safety and increased customer satisfaction
jr east continues to work to provide an environment in which all employees can enjoy their jobs while
constantly striving to attain even higher goals to that end we are determined to face the challenge of
creating a company where people grow through their work from the perspectives of how to respond to
the motivation of each employee to meet challenges how to ensure a suitable worklife balance and how
to make full use of the diversity of our human resources
injr east group management vision v ever onward         the company advocated reforms to its culture
including opening up our organization to young employees and giving increased opportunities for
motivated people to apply for inclusion in training and other new projects exchanging people with
other companies passing on technical knowledge and skills to the next generation and participating in
technological innovation and overseas railway projects



recruitment
jr east s main supports are the capabilities of each and every employee our basic philosophy is to
employ people based chiefly on their personalities and abilities and then to steadily nurture them
until they reach the full flowering of their abilities because of the large number of employees reaching
retirement age in the fiscal year ending march 2015 and the constant necessity for human resources
development and the transfer of knowledge and technologies to the next generation we have recruited
about 1800 new employees

care to increase their awareness of this problem we have also set up a counseling service in conjunction

to promote frontline care in the workplace beginning in the fiscal year ended march 2008 we also
organized training programs for onsite supervisors

during the fiscal year ended march 2009 jr east introduced the elderly employee system that
encourages employees who have reached retirement age to continue working for group companies that
can benefit from their individual capabilities and skills this is done by 90 of the eligible employees
through this plan we hope to enable retired employees to stabilize their lives until they reach their
fully pensionable ages as well as to encourage them to continue to contribute to our groupwide
accumulation of knowhow

 user of maintenance master nurturing academy program
 now able to see own work from objective perspective
 thanks to the nurturing academy
 i was employed after having worked at a household appliance manufacturer where i was in charge of design
 work since joining jr east i have been involved in mainly railcar inspection and track maintenance work
 the age composition of the workplace included only the baby boomer generation and young employees
 with no employees in between to act as intermediaries and this made me feel slightly concerned as an
                                                              engineer notably the technical management
                                                              department i belonged to was made up of mostly
                                                              veteran employees increasingly raising doubts
                                                              about whether younger employees could manage to
                                                              acquire the same skills within the short period that
                                                              remained
                                                              it was at that point that amaintenance master

                                                              intensively over two years it was a great opportunity
                                                              to address the issues that were concerning me
                                                              and i was eager to apply for the program now
                                                              that i managed to pass the screening my present
                                                              thoughts are on acquiring every skill and knowhow
                                                              possible in the given two years to become a person
                                                              that can contribute to society even if just a little as

                                                              at the nurturing academy the required skills are
                                                              basically learned through ojt but there are also
 many programs that one would not be able to experience other than with the nurturing academy these
 included group training at the head office and visiting the plants of nonrailway companies through such
 experience i sense that i can now see things from various angles even in the daily ojt at the general rolling
 stock center by going though each work division in a short period of time i can now objectively look at
 my own work and workplace from the perspective of a different
 department i can now understand better the movements of those
 people around me that i had been watching vaguely and see things
 i could not recognize before another advantage is that many
 participants of the nurturing academy have clear high goals which
 is extremely inspiring and i too am kept highly motivated
      s railways especially jr east constantly place safety first
 japan
 have extremely low delays in train operations and such a high
 level of punctuality is well recognized around the world this
 would be impossible without excellent railcar management and
 maintenance in fact once i have gone through acquiring railcar
 maintenance and management skills at the nurturing academy i
 dream of participating in overseas projects and put such skills to
 good use i see the way jr east takes a comprehensive approach
 in overseas projects to encompass not only railcar manufacturing
 but also maintenance and other aspects too as a strength
 therefore i hope to be able to make at least a slight contribution
 to infrastructure development in emerging countries based on the          takayuki onodera

compliance

                basic concept of compliance

jr east adopted our policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the group        s
corporate activity guidelines concomitantly we established compliance hotlines both inside and outside
the company for internal reporting and have promoted efforts on compliance
in addition we continue to implement a program of education for all group employees every year and
strive to raise their awareness of the need for compliance
other approaches to further promotion of complianceminded management throughout the group may be
exemplified by our confirmation of the proper execution of our business through general checks of legal
and regulatory requirements concerning all aspects of it and activities using abasic matter confirmation
support sheetthat should be periodically checked in each location



formulation and revision of the compliance action plan
in 2005 jr east adopted our policy on legal and regulatory compliance and corporate ethics as the
group s activity guidelines to heighten the efficacy of these guidelines we also prepared the compliance
action plan which sets forth advisable modes of conduct for all employees of the jr east japan group
we are distributing the plan to all employees in the form of the compliance action plan handbook
in 2013 with the formulation of jr east group management vision v we revised the 2005 policy together
with the compliance action plan handbook taking into consideration the social changes surrounding the
company we will continue to ensure that all employees of the jr east group completely understand
and follow the compliance action plan and review it according to ongoing environmental and societal
changes



strengthening mechanism for proper business conduct
we conducted full inspections of our compliance for all our operations including group companies
starting with the inspections jr east group is promoting continuous reviews of all its operations based
on laws and regulations internal rules and social norms
in 2011 jr east created thebasic matter confirmation support sheetlisting matters subject to regular
checking and requiring heads of departments to personally ensure that business is carried out properly
we endeavor to achieve thorough implementation at each workplace



ensuring information security
with the advancement of the information society ensuring the security of our information systems has
become an important issue
jr east has designed and introduced an information security management system and carries out
necessary measures to ensure safe and secure information system operations we have also established
a contact system in the event a problem should occur and we conduct problem response drills
all employees are kept aware of the importance of information security and the strict handling of
information through our group rule book and internal magazine all employees also receive information
security education with the aim of raising awareness about how they should guarantee workplace
information security

education of all employees
we began providing compliance education for all employees in 2009 in order to heighten awareness of
the need for compliance among each and every one of them in fiscal 2014 we carried out a program
of education including a case study which prompted employees to consider cases that could occur
in their workplace for the purpose of tightening adherence to guidelines for conduct based on the
revised compliance action plan handbook we will follow this in fiscal 2015 with continued education
to enhance compliance awareness that centered around cases and topics based on the recent social
situation and actual conditions in workplaces
in addition in fiscal 2014 besides conducting a questionnaire in conjunction with our compliance
education for all employees we surveyed employee awareness of compliance by means of the group
company compliance questionnaire which was conducted mainly with employees of the management
and planning divisions at the member firms of our group
we are committed to continued compliance education based on the social responsibility our company
must discharge and the changes in the mindset of our employees

in june 2010 having obtained a permit from the director of the hokuriku regional development bureau
of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism to again take water from the shinano river
we resumed operation of the shinanogawa power station
we are redoubling our efforts at compliance management to prevent occurrence of similar incidents and

independent assurance report website version




the complex process of calculating energy use and co2 emissions on a non
consolidated basis has been reorganized over the past few years starting
from this year co2 emissions are disclosed by categorizing emissions into
scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and other improvements are being made
toward aligning with global trends in the disclosure of information on co2
emissions in addition we believe working on the data survey sheet format
and clarifying data definitions are also improving the accuracy of data
collection year by year we believe that introducing an information system
for data collection with such initiatives at the core will not only reduce
human error but also improve the efficiency of calculation work
with jr east businesses other than the railway business growing in presence
we also believe it is becoming difficult to convey the environmental and
social aspects of the jr east group as a whole when disclosure is only
                                                                                 naomi sugo
being made for the railway business on a nonconsolidated basis we              kpmg
suggest future consideration of the volume of information and how detailed       azsa sustainability co ltd

disclosure should be made on the environmental and social aspects of the
nonrailway businesses in addition we also believe that preparing csr
reports in accordance with the gri guidelines has become a global trend
that the jr east group which is accelerating overseas business expansion
cannot ignore the gri g4 guidelines released last year require that
information disclosure be focused on material information with clarification
ofmaterialityfor the corporate group we suggest jr east proceed
systematically toward preparing reports in accordance with the gri guidelines
