    measures to further improve the safety
    of the hamaoka nuclear power station
    chubu electric power shut down the hamaoka nuclear power station in may 2011 in response to a request by the
    national government our first priority in making this decision was to provide a sincere response to people s concerns
    about the safety of nuclear power generation and regain trust in the safety of nuclear energy from society at large
    including local communities
        under these circumstances chubu electric power is facing serious management challenges with regard to the
    fulfillment of its csr we should improve the safety of our power generation facilities including the hamaoka nuclear
    power station and increase public understanding of these facilities while ensuring the stable supply of electricity and
    improving our financial situation
        in this feature article we will introduce the measures that chubu electric power has been implementing since the
    suspension of operations at the hamaoka nuclear power station
    based on the plan as of july 30 2012 should a significant change be made to the plan a revised version will be made available through press
    releases and on the web site

     response to the first report of nankai trough massive earthquake
     model investigative commission cabinet office
      in march 2012 the cabinet office publicly announced that the                         even in the event that the power station loses some of its
      maximum height of a tsunami that might strike the hamaoka                        func tions the station will never theless be able to continue
      nuclear power station would be 21 m above sea level thus                        providing its minimum required functions by using sequential
      exceeding the height of the breakwater of the power station                     alternative approaches we believe we can increase the reliability of
      chubu electric power deems it necessary to design safety measures                the entire system by taking a stepbystep approach to tsunamis
      for the power station and set them in place in anticipation of                   based on their height
      tsunamis exceeding the height of the breakwater

 1     4 extension of time for completing tsunami
          countermeasures
chubu electric power had made progress toward its december 2012 target for completing certain tsunami countermeasures at a cost of about 140 billion
yen at the hamaoka nuclear power station as established in july 2011 however with some measures for which revisions were announced in march 2012
the amount of work increased significantly leading to problems such as too much work scheduled at one time subsequently on july 30 2012 the
company announced that it had become necessary to extend the work period by about a year
     flooding prevention measures 1 such as the breakwater and the increase reliability of waterproof doors in outer walls of buildings part of
flooding prevention measures 2 continue to progress according to the original schedule
     chubu electric will examine the necessity of revising existing measures as well as implementing additional measures to ensure the safety of the
hamaoka nuclear power station against earthquakes and tsunamis based on the results of surveys conducted on the fukushima daiichi nuclear power
station accident and on the announcements made by the cabinet offices nankai trough massive earthquake model investigative commission


reference rationale for extension of the work period

 revision of a part of the work plan announced in march 2012                                rationale for extension of the work period

  we will be increasing the amount of cooling equipment that receives              while studying detailed plans for site work as we prepared to place
  electric power from gas turbine generators located on high ground                orders for revised measures we found that the amount of work had
  emergency ac power supply equipment to ensure enough electrical               increased significantly leading to problems such as too much work
  capacity to operate these pieces of cooling equipment the number of             scheduled at one time so an extension of about one year is necessary
  gas turbine generators cables power panels etc will all be increased

3 postdisaster measures

it is important to make recovery plans and have necessary systems and                including improving the related manuals to ensure the safe resumption of
procedures in place in order to ensure that we can resume the supply of             the facilities we have also been storing spare parts and materials
electricity to users soon after the occurrence of a disaster chubu electric         necessary to recover from a disaster
power has been implementing measures to resume the operation of its                       at present we are examining storing more spare parts and materials
main power generation facilities steadily and safely after a disaster               in order to enable a swifter recovery from earthquakes and tsunamis

 3     2 measures to ensure stable supply
chubu electric power will implement measures to ensure a safe and stable                chubu electric power will continue to aim for a balanced mix of sources
supply of electricity from a mid to longterm perspective                        to secure the safe and stable supply of electricity while taking consideration
     as the first step to achieve this goal we will strive to assure the even     of energy security issues and the goal of a lower carbon society
safer operation of hamaoka nuclear power station meanwhile each unit of
joetsu thermal power station total capacity 2380 mw will enter
commercial operation between july 2012 and may 2014 in order to
accelerate the use of renewable energy we will continue to steadily develop
tokuyama hydro power station total capacity 1534 mw while continuing
groupwide efforts to develop mega solar power stations wind power
stations and smallersized hydro power stations
     in addition we will work to start the operation of nishinagoya
thermal power station unit no 7 total capacity approximately
2316 mw in fiscal 2017 this is in response to the decisions by other
electric companies to delay the construction of nuclear power stations
from which we were planning to receive electricity meaning that we now
have to secure other sources of supply by bringing forward the launch of
nishinagoya thermal power station unit no 7 we can also cut fuel
consumption and co2 emissions
                                                                                   joetsu thermal power station unit no 11 started operation in july 2012

in the summer and winter of 2011 chubu electric power worked on                   and lng
various measures to compensate the energy supply reduced by the                        while we worked on these measures to overcome the situation on
suspension of operation at hamaoka nuclear power station we resumed               the supply side many of our customers supported us by reducing
the operation of some thermal power plants that had planned for                    consumption or changing their operational schedule to avoid peak hours
longterm shutdown plan and changed the timing or duration of regular              thanks to their cooperation we were able to supply electricity in a stable

basis for calculation
investments and expenses related to preventing reducing andor avoiding environmental impact removing the impact putting right any damage and other activities instrumental to these
are measured
 investment amounts are expenditures allocated out of capital investment for environmental conservation
 expenses associated with investments such as depreciation equipment leasing and maintenance and operating costs are calculated taking into account factors such as the depreciation

    major comments from members                                                    major comments from members
    it is very important for electric power companies to clarify their policy      the breakwater construction works seem to be effective and reliable
     on renewable energy they also need to explore how to promote                   i hope further efforts will be made to strengthen antiseismic measures
     renewable energy in society in order to facilitate proper understanding        in order to restart the nuclear power station it is important to take
     of the issue                                                                   multilevel safety measures
    chubu electric power should emphasize its efforts to improve thermal           ensuring safety does not equate to reassuring the public in order to truly
     efficiency and reduce co2 emissions at thermal power plants                    reassure customers on safety measures social trust in chubu electric power

   to reflect customers opinions in improving its services chubu electric power actively creates opportunities to listen to objective comments and
   advice from external parties to allow the company to share the same viewpoint as its customers in april 2012 we had a meeting with the
   members of the central japan branch of the nippon association of consumer specialists nacs to exchange opinions on our activities in
   fiscal 2011 comments and requests received will be used to improve our future activities

    major opinions
    the size of the type used in notices received from chubu electric power is too small and the writing style
     is too formal the text should be simplified and important points should be emphasized more by using
     larger type or enclosing sentences in a box so that they can be understood by everyone regardless of age
    more warnings should be issued about energy saving frauds and unscrupulous sales practices more
     information including specific precautions that consumers need to take and examples of typical sales
     pitches should be provided by chubu electric power
    the membership and login process for the electricity charges inquiry service should be simplified in addi
     tion if graphs showing a yearonyear comparison of electricity usage kwh for each household are avail
     able they will lead to higher motivation for people to save electricity                                                  a scene at the meeting
