dear ladies and gentlemen

i am delighted to present to you today the kion groups first sustainability report
      with our acquisition of dematic last year we bolstered our portfolio with an automation and
supplychain optimisation specialist ushering in a new chapter at the kion group we have be
come an even stronger company and can now offer our global customers an extensive portfo
lio of intralogistics solutions
      a great deal is rightly expected from such a company  and we are doing everything we
can to meet what is expected of us by our customers as well as a large number of other stake
holder groups with an interest in our groups activities
      the fair treatment of business partners our dependability as an employer towards our em
ployees and their families the responsible use of resources climate protection and engagement
in society in which we are actively involved as a company are all key aspects of our actions
and a cornerstone of our sustainability activities
      by meeting our stakeholders expectations we also address the key challenges faced by
companies and society today ranging from climate change through resource scarcity to the
consequences of globalisation and demographic change we are all called upon to address
these core issues after all only those companies which can provide specific answers will have
a future
      even though our group is still young our brands have a tradition reaching back many
decades  with some stretching back over 100 years our company history has taught us that
sustainability and business success are inextricably linked so we see our sustainability activities




w e a r e m o v e d b y s u s ta i n a b i l i t y                                                     sustainability report 2016  kion group ag

                                                                          foreword kion group sustainability report                                 7




as a longterm investment  in our company as well as for the benefit of our customers and the
society of which we are a part
    going forward we will report transparently on our engagement every year providing up
dates on our progress and performance as well as on the objectives we have not yet achieved
the internationally recognised global reporting initiative guidelines form the basis of our report
ing activities as we want to ensure that our activities are comparable this comparability is un
derpinned by our facts and figures for 2016 which will serve as comparative values for future
reports
    our first report illustrates that we are serious about wanting sustainability to be an integral
part of our company we are harmonising our processes along those lines raising awareness
among our employees and managers and calling on them to make the kion group that bit
better every day  also in terms of sustainability we also have our suppliers and business part
ners firmly in view we call for and encourage their commitment as sustainability does not begin
and end at our factory gates rather we need to ensure that our entire value chain meets our
high standards in doing so we also aim to lead our industry by our sustainability engagement
    indeed we have already achieved a great deal in recent years in this area we now need to
bring a systematic structure to our activities and measures within a groupwide sustainability
management system to this end in the reporting year we developed a clear sustainability
strategy and are currently establishing the structures to coordinate our activities across the
group our recently established sustainability steering committee will meet regularly to support
these activities and put them on the right track their work will be underpinned by a dedicated
sustainability programme which we are currently defining
    as cfo i know that controlling is a challenging task  even more so in terms of sustainabili
ty as there are very wideranging levers and kpis however i am confident that we will suc
cessfully drive forward the systematic integration of our sustainability management i am already
looking forward to next year and our 2017 report in which we will share the progress we have
made to becoming a more sustainable group i would like to thank you for accompanying us on
this journey and i hope you find this report both informative and interesting
    yours sincerely

strategy the definition of the corresponding action fields the de        through to positive experiences on work safety which are worth
rivation of initial objectives and benchmarks and continued right         replicating the high level of acceptance shows that employees
through to the appointment of people responsible for each action            consider this measure to be effective this is just one of many ex

    the speed and manner in which we implemented these                      the suggestion scheme also plays an important role here too as
steps fill me with confidence after all both of these show that           good ideas are usually also ideas that move us forward in terms
sustainability is already firmly embedded in our company  that             of sustainability

we need leaders who are responsible for these processes we                 cludes for example our shareholders our employees in all units
give them the necessary structures and tools to be able to take             and at our operating units naturally our customers too we aim to

      dr
are now harnessing the benefit of these experiences at kion
this is a further reason why we have already achieved a lot in
such a short space of time and linde material handling is not
alone at still and our other operating units too numerous
measures are currently running worldwide which are moving us
forward at both a brand and group level it is now important to
establish uniform standards across the group to manage our
sustainability activities systematically at the same time our oper
ating units can implement individual measures such as to provide
targeted support to their customers

they are either bypassed or the device is stopped if the path is
