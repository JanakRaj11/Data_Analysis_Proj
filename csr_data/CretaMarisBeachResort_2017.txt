the sustainability report as a tool for creta maris further development 
since its construction in 1975 creta maris beach resort aims to provide hospitality services that would mirror the culture the history and the customs of crete the principle
of its operation was to respect the employee the partner and the society while its goal was to offer equal or even higher quality services than any other tourist accommoda
tion in the country

during the last years the goals have multiplied due to the emergence of crete as a worldfamous tourist destination thanks to its favorable climatic conditions the natural
beauty and its cultural heritage which is now threatening its environment and its local culture
true to its philosophy creta maris operates on the basis of the sustainability thereby protecting the society the environment and highlighting the history and culture of
crete all these actions have been captured during the past four years in our annual sustainability reports which serves not only as a communication tool between the resort
and society but also as a development tool
this report like all the previous ones is the basis of our next year operation while it is the one that sets our new goals even higher year by year making us even better

73 water
water consumption
water is the basic element of life and development without it our country would not be the
same and our destination would not be thriving realizing the importance of water and un
derstanding the intense drought problem our country is facing especially during the summer
months we skipped ahead to the following actions

   drilling
   desalination units
   units of reverse osmosis and filtration
   automatic night watering the green areas and the organic fields of the hotel
   application of irrigation systems based on drops systems drips and underground irriga
                                                                                                            maximum allowable water consumption for 5 hotels according to the
    tion systems with reduced water evaporation
                                                                                                           greek legislation
   change single drip line with hose netafim
   water reduction filters to all taps of the hotel

the water offered in our unit is produced directly on site eliminating the transport chain the
times and places of storage the water is free from harmful substances through reverse osmosis
followed by filtration and checked regularly through laboratory tests
with the use of refillable glass bottles we faced the very dangerous phenomenon of bottled
water overconsumption of all inclusive in the past guests used to open bottles of water offered
to them free of charge without consuming the whole amount but throwing it in the trash with
refillable bottles and coolers customers consume the water they really need

economic benefits
   reduce cost of bottled water
   the cost per liter of creta maris drinking water is much lower than the cost per liter of the
    municipal drinking water

in conclusion the abovementioned implemented actions contributed to better management of                  maximum allowable water consumption for 5 hotels according to the
existing resources environmental protection and to reduction of costs                                    greek legislation


calculation of water consumption
aiming to the best possible presentation of the results of creta maris water consumption from
this year and on we take into account two constants the theoretical water consumption which is
the maximum allowable water consumption for 5 hotels according to the greek legislation and
takes into account factors such as resorts size facilities and services overnight stays conferences
spa nonresidents which the hotel offers as well as the actual water consumption that the resort
managed to have due to its sustainable operation in order to calculate the actual water consump
tion of creta maris we gathered all the necessary data regarding the irrigation the swimming pools
and the total overnight stays recorded by the resort for the years 2015 and 2016 finally there is
also available the presentation of the water consumption both with and without the desalination

                                                                                                                                                                                  43

 waste management
    each purchase is a real need of the hotel we do not make reckless purchases
     in order to get a better price on the contrary we prefer to make purchases of
     the actual quantities are needed demand based
    we purchase products in ecopackaging with the least possible packaging
     material used
    the procurement department informs the seller in every negotiation that
     our company operates in an environmentally friendly manner and asks the
     supplier to present the various environmentally friendly products on offer
    priority is given to products that are locally produced
    priority is given to products with recyclable and returnable packaging as well
     as those derived from recycled materials mainly paper aluminum glass
     plastic without excessive multipack
    the purchase of disposable items such as cocktails decorations glasses
     etc is avoided and when they are necessary biodegradable products are
     preferred
