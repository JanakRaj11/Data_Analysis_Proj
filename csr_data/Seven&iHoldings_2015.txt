       problem by making progress in it and systemization              no longer rare or highly valued items in regional areas
       establishing efficient operations that also respond to           thats why we dont simply develop a product in tokyo
       diversity the second pair of opposing concepts is indi        and use the same recipe in a uniform fashion across the
       vidual optimization and overall optimization while for        entire country instead we consider it important give
       mulating general guidelines and strengthening rules and          careful thought to the unique tastes in each region we
       principles you have also responded to individual needs         research thoroughly about the types of tastes preferred
