  our ongoing responsibility to balance the economic interests of      consumption figures on key equipment speak for themselves we
  our company with those of our stakeholders and the environment      have recently obtained an environment certification iso14001
  we furthermore commit to share this information with our stake      which will further aid us monitor and improve our environmental
  holders using our primary channels of communication                 performance in the years to come

  in this annual communication on progress we describe our            also worth mentioning for 2012 we stepped up on our efforts
  actions taken in 2012 to improve our performance on csr related      concerning anticorruption by formulating and communicating
  matters we are still relatively new to introducing csr to our       detailed guidelines to our organisation
  organisation however compared to when we took our first small
  steps in 2010 we believe to have made notable progress during
  the last couple of years

                                                         silicon plays a role in this context and

     vehicles
     in future more electric cars and hybrid vehicles
     on the road may be anticipated however they
     can only run if their batteries are charged
     beforehand and it is only possible to shift to a
     higher or lower gear if the electricity supply is
     regulated

     silicon may be used for energyefficient
     electricity supply and regulation silicon
     is used for example under the bonnet
