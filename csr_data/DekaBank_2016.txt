2  global compact communication on progress




      dear shareholders and investors

     anlegen statt stilllegen  this was the title of the information campaign launched by the deka group in 2015
on the issue of investing in securities given that interest rates remain persistently very low we firmly believe that
the returns needed in order to build up assets and provide for retirement can only be achieved using securities
people on medium or low incomes also need to organise their investments with this in mind  indeed doing so is
particularly important for such people it is also important to consider risk and find the right blend of income and
stability at the same time neither of these things is possible without a sensible level of diversification of the invest
ments and sound customerfocused advice

as the wertpapierhaus for the savings banks this is something we are fully committed to providing we therefore
see it as our duty to cultivate a securities culture in germany that is even more closely aligned with the interests of
the individual investor and society as a whole and hence sustainable in the best sense of the word for us this also
means helping to make sustainable investing possible with our banking products and services

we put this goal into practice in our business every day as evidenced by the fact that we have implemented a
sustainability filter for our proprietary investments of more than 15bn as at 31 december 2015 that prevents us
from investing in questionable business models since 2013 we have altered our lending process so that all the
financing we grant is checked in advance to ensure that it meets our sustainability criteria our services are audited
by national and international rating agencies specialising in sustainability and have been awarded high ratings

we were especially pleased to note that deka received a very good aa rating in its very first evaluation by msci a
global provider of sustainability analyses and environmental social and governance esg ratings for us operating
sustainably means keeping in mind the interests of all relevant stakeholders when making decisions in 2015 there
fore we also opened a formal process of dialogue with our major stakeholders during which we asked them what
topics were especially important to them this dialogue formed part of a materiality study that we launched in
partnership with the savings banks association badenwuerttemberg the study was carried out by consulting
firm imug in the final quarter of the financial year as well as the savings banks association badenwuerttemberg
the survey was also supported by the rhineland savings banks and giro association the savings banks association
westphalialippe the kreissparkasse köln cologne district savings bank and the hannover savings bank the
results of the survey form the basis for the future development of our sustainability activities and allow us to organ
ise our reporting in this area accordingly as we proceed with this work we are guided by the principle of focus
ing on the fundamentals our stakeholders expressed a particular desire to see more information on sustainable
corporate governance and sustainable products in our reporting we are happy to accommodate their wishes in
this report

                                                                                                                sustainability report  3




in the 2015 sustainability report we present our efforts to promote a business approach that adds value as we
develop the company further addresses the needs of our end customers and society as a whole and preserves our
natural environment

the report also details the progress we have made in implementing the ten internationally recognised principles to
which we are committed under the un global compact in the areas of human rights labour standards environ
mental protection and anticorruption the report is based on the global reporting initiative gri guidelines and
uses the g4 format for the first time including the financial services sector supplement the gri content index can
be found on our website wwwdekade

sustainability is an essential component of our business strategy and is part of our business models dna for this
reason at the end of 2015 we made the issue of sustainability an integral part of the d18 strategic transformation
programme adopted by our board of management we are well aware that doing so places great demands on us
and we work continually to live up to the challenge  in line with the wishes of our owners customers employees
and society at large

we look forward to continuing our dialogue with you

with best wishes

           sustainability as part of our business strategy


           strategic positioning with regard to sustainability is a binding part of the deka groups
           business strategy which must be updated each year the strategy is formulated passed and
           communicated to the administrative board and the regulator by the board of management
           since 2015 we have elected not to formulate a separate sustainability strategy as the wert
           papierhaus for the savings banks we manage sustainability throughout the whole value
           chain in line with the three guiding principles of economy ecology and social responsibility
           as we continue to develop our approach to sustainability and refine our reporting from 2015
           onwards we are focusing even more strongly on the areas of activity that our stakeholders
           deem to be particularly relevant our focus is based on a materiality study which must be
           carried out each year

      the commitment to organise our business in a sustainable manner is enshrined in the deka group philos
ophy this philosophy reflects dekabanks mandate as wertpapierhaus for the savings banks and is based on the
strategic guidelines of its owners as agreed in the dresdner thesen in 2013 at the 25th savings banks confer
ence in april 2016 the owners issued the düsseldorf declaration which expands these guidelines to include a
pledge to further strengthen sustainable regional development details of our approach to sustainable corporate
governance which is enshrined in our business strategy can be found at wwwdekade

the sustainability management department coordinates all of the deka groups sustainability activities on behalf
of the board of management

      communication of sustainability issues
      in addition to the survey carried out as part of the materiality study we maintain an ongoing dialogue on
sustainability issues with the various stakeholder groups and inform them promptly about events and develop
ments we rely on an integrated approach to communication to do this deka uses a range of channels to keep
the public employees and shareholders informed employees receive regular information about sustainability
issues via our staff magazine and the intranet

the most recent rating from oekom research provides an example of how a sustainability issue can be communi
cated across a range of channels the wertpapierhaus of the savings banks achieved a higher overall score of c
and was once again awarded prime status deka issued a press release covering this news in january 2015 and
informed its own employees via a report on the deka intranet dekabank inline as well as an article in the staff
magazine inkom deka also informed its shareholders and exclusive sales partners  the savings banks  about
the result of oekom researchs assessment

rating agencies specialising in the field of sustainability are another important target group for communication
the main ways in which we communicate with external parties are via active media and public relations commu
nication with customers and by maintaining a dialogue with agencies specialising in sustainability ratings deka
works closely with the msci sustainalytics oekom research and imug agencies

                                        sustainable corporate governance

      dekabank is a german federal institution incorporated under public law and part of the sparkassenfinanz
gruppe it is bound by the principles of subsidiarity and a focus on serving the common good the deka groups
customers owners and employees are entitled to expect highquality banking services that do not just satisfy
legal and regulatory requirements but also meet ethical and social standards

6  sustainability as part of our business strategy




      internal regulations and standards
      the code of ethics provides a binding framework of principles governing the behaviour of our employees
and of third parties acting on behalf of the deka group it represents the basic structure for a corporate culture
within the deka group that complies with the law is open and transparent and seeks to add value the current
version of the code which dates from 1 june 2014 is available for all stakeholders to view on the deka groups
website

compliance with the rules of conduct will be assessed across the board for all deka group employees from the
2016 financial year onwards

during appraisals when discussing whether targets have been achieved managers will assess whether employ
ees behaviour met the rules of conduct with reference to the code of ethics

      external regulations and standards
      in operational terms the deka groups commitment to a sustainable business policy is borne out by its
accession to the un global compact in 2011 and its signing of the equator principles in december 2013 the
deka group also signed the german sustainability code issued by the federal governments council for sustain
able development rat für nachhaltige entwicklung  rne the declaration of compliance with the german
sustainability code was most recently renewed in december 2015 for the 2014 reporting period

when financing projects deka has adhered to the equator principles since 2008 and signed a declaration adopt
ing them in 2011 the current report is available on the equator principles website wwwequatorprinciplescom

deka investment gmbh became a signatory to the united nations principles for responsible investment un pri
in 2012 under this agreement institutional investors make a commitment to act in a sustainable and responsible
fashion in the interests of society as a whole the un pri agreement is based on the idea that environmental
social and corporate governance esg issues can influence an investment portfolios results

hence the six un pri principles stipulate that esg issues should be incorporated into analysis and decisionmaking
processes to a greater degree and should be applied actively in ownership policies and practices the principles
also require deka to seek appropriate disclosure on esg issues by the entities in which it invests as a signatory
to the agreement deka investment gmbh undertakes to report on its progress towards implementing the indi
vidual principles each year the pri secretariat evaluates the activities of signatories on the basis of this informa
tion and also publishes details of those activities in a report each year on the un pri website

the deka groups sustainability reporting is prepared in accordance with the global reporting initiative gri
guidelines using the g4 format and the financial services sector supplement the sustainability report complies
with core and has been audited by an independent expert

      compliance
      the compliance corporate centre plays a major role in ensuring that dekabank acts in the interest of its
customers to conform at all times with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and with its own  some
times even stricter  internal rules and regulations the compliance corporate centre covers all issues relating to
capitalmarket and realestate compliance marisk compliance tax compliance and information security manage
ment it is also responsible for combating money laundering and terrorism financing implementing eu sanctions
and embargoes and preventing fraud and other criminal activities

the corporate centre develops groupwide standards and guidelines on relevant issues and provides correspond
ing training programmes and advice on their implementation it is also heavily involved in projects and processes
geared towards ensuring that the deka group meets regulatory requirements and that potential conflicts of
interest are identified and avoided as far as possible the corporate centre carries out monitoring and control
tasks at all levels of banking operations and is dedicated to the systematic management of potential compliance
risks

                                                                                                                  sustainability report  7




as the parent company dekabank ensures compliance with due diligence rules under the german money laun
dering act geldwäschegesetz  gwg and the german banking act kreditwesengesetz  kwg by means of its
minimum standards for the prevention of money laundering so that transparency regarding customers and
the underlying shareholder structure is guaranteed both in germany and in the subsidiaries this prevents the use
of opaque forms of business organisation that could aid tax evasion including in switzerland the office there was
closed at the end of 2014 and luxembourg

by making a corresponding declaration in their employment contract all staff are obliged to observe the provi
sions of banking secrecy and data protection from the moment they commence employment this undertaking
is given in accordance with relevant national laws germany luxembourg

the code of ethics also governs the whistleblowing system this system ensures that information provided by
employees and also by individuals outside dekabank relating to illegal or dishonest actions can be reported in
confidence to dekabanks ombudsman the ombudsman looks into the circumstances involved and forwards the
relevant information to dekabank in a confidential manner as a solicitor the ombudsman is subject to a profes
sional requirement to maintain confidentiality our whistleblowing system guarantees that whistleblowers remain
anonymous and are afforded protection

our compliance staff are always available to all employees for help with questions and uncertainties relating to
matters of integrity employees are provided with contact details for compliance staff when they first join the
company and these can also be found on the intranet and in training materials at any time

procedures and controls are in place in the specialist units and also within the compliance unit itself that serve
to prevent and detect irregularities for example in connection with other criminal activities detrimental to the
bank and are an integral part of the deka groups compliance management system

as part of its fight against corruption the deka group has established rules governing the circumstances under
which gifts and invitations may be accepted from third parties or extended to them a mandatory written
authorisation process is in place for all employees including executive bodies and all employees are made aware
of its contents by means of suitable publications as a basic principle employees may not give accept or request
gifts or invitations in connection with their work either for themselves or for third parties if doing so could com
promise the interests of dekabank or its customers insofar as it is in line with the applicable laws and other
standards the giving of gifts and invitations is consistent with standard market practice within certain limits as
the professional independence of all involved parties can be at stake however it is incumbent upon employees
to avoid even the mere semblance of a conflict of interest

the compliance unit runs mandatory training courses for all employees there are also further courses for specific
groups of employees and additional adhoc courses are provided where necessary the training concept is based
on facetoface courses in combination with webbased training and training documents

      data protection
      in the federal republic of germany data protection is governed by the federal data protection act bun
desdatenschutzgesetz  bdsg and the corresponding federal state data protection laws the purpose of the
bdsg as set out in section 1 of the act is to protect individuals from any infringement of their constitutionally
protected personal rights caused by the handling of their personal data

dekabanks data protection unit works to ensure that the bdsg and other data protection regulations are
observed within the deka group in germany the data protection officer reports directly to the board of man
agement or in his capacity as an external data protection officer to the management of the subsidiaries to avoid
conflicts of interest the data protection officer is independent of the compliance corporate centre and is based
in a separate unit in the legal corporate centre his responsibilities include providing employees with relevant
information on the subject of data protection this is done using various media such as the intranet and the
banks inhouse employee magazine staff are also required to take online tests on data protection issues

8  sustainability as part of our business strategy




in order to ensure that the requirements of data protection law are complied with dekabanks data protection
unit has set up a data protection management system ie it has established processes to ensure that statutory
requirements concerning data protection are implemented during the planning commissioning and operation of
data processing systems and after those data processing systems are withdrawn from use these processes are
also set out in a comprehensive data protection concept which describes for example what elements must be
taken into consideration when working with personal data

inter alia the data protection unit uses the following measures to help ensure that data protection processes are
implemented in a sustainable manner

          privacy impact assessments

          ongoing support for projects

          involvement in drafting contracts that involve data protection law

          monitoring the proper application of programs intended for use in processing personal data

          providing training to familiarise individuals involved in data processing with data protection regulations
           and their obligation to keep data confidential

          data protection courses

          monitoring and coordinating the technical and organisational measures required to ensure that data is
           protected

          carrying out advance checks and documenting the outcome of these

          verifying processes procedures etc to establish whether they comply with the requirements of data
           protection law

          monitoring the register of procedures for areas that process personal data

          preparing internal procedures and guidelines covering the practical implementation of data protection
           rules

documentation of procedures has been revised or newly issued in order to ensure that the requirements of data
protection law are met the revised version of the order processing procedure document includes refinements
of the existing processes as well as new regulations numerous appendiceschecklists have been introduced in
order to satisfy the increased requirement for checks and documentation the new examination and escalation
process for data protection risks procedure document standardises the regulations governing the implementa
tion of issues arising from the findings of data protection audits by the specialist units

      training courses  employee awareness raising
      under section 4g 1 clause 4 no 2 of the bdsg data protection officers must make all employees
involved in processing personal data aware of the goals and content of the data protection regulations

in addition individual employees are also obliged to ensure that personal data is not made available to and does
not fall into the hands of unauthorised persons employees must also be subject to an obligation to keep data
confidential as required by section 5 of the bdsg

however these formal requirements are not the only reasons for implementing staff training courses and aware
nessraising measures it is critical that individual employees have a firm grasp of the importance and special
position of data protection at dekabank

                                                                                                               sustainability report  9




training courses and awarenessraising activities must therefore make sure that as well as understanding the
general goals of data protection employees are also aware what personal data is and what requirements must
be met when handling personal data employees must be informed of their rights and obligations as a person
involved with data protection in addition the risks to the company and the employees themselves if the provi
sions are breached must be presented finally employees must be able to apply what they have learned in
practice

our awarenessraising measures cover the following topics

        raising awareness of data protection and data security requirements among management

        raising awareness of data protection and data security requirements among employees

        explaining the key requirements of data protection law

        explaining data protection measures involved in preventing employees from acting in a way that could
         endanger data security

        sanctions as a consequence of failing to implement the measures intended to ensure compliance with
         data protection and data security requirements

        security measures required outside the area of automated data processing for example measures to
         ensure that individuals privacy is not violated


      elearning program
      the elearning program enables employees to take a training course themselves using the pc at their desk
once employees have worked through the data protection training a certificate is automatically produced to
prove that they took the course this is documented in the data protection records all new employees receive
written notification that they are required to complete this elearning program and familiarise themselves with
the basic principles of data protection the data protection team also documents data protection training under
taken by employees

      data protection newsletter
      the data protection newsletter has become an established integral part of the way we keep our staff
informed we have received a great deal of feedback confirming that the range of topics presented on current
matters in the field of data protection law has been well received

      facetoface training
      our experience in recent years has shown that the advantage of facetoface training is that it makes it
possible to address issues more efficiently by providing for a direct exchange of views between specialist units
and the data protection team in particular the inclusion of data protection as a discussion point in established
forums for example regular meetings on the same day each week has helped to increase its acceptance

      audits
      pursuant to section 4g of the bdsg the data protection officer works to ensure compliance with the
requirements of data protection law this also involves data protection audits carried out on the specialist units
each data protection audit follows an audit plan and usually also involves spot checks the results are docu
mented and brought to the attention of the specialist unit

10  sustainability as part of our business strategy




      reporting system
      a reporting system has been established to inform the board of management and the management of
subsidiary companies of any compliance deficiencies or risks that are identified the board of management and
the relevant management teams at subsidiary companies are also regularly informed of the findings of the data
protection audit and made aware of any data protection risks

an additional reporting system is in place for local money laundering and fraud officers to report to the group
money laundering or fraud officer

      complaint management
      complaint management in the deka group follows the stipulations of the european directive on the coor
dination of laws regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in
transferable securities ucits it is fully embraced and supported by senior management audits carried out by
the regulator over many years have consistently confirmed that the process is appropriate and properly
implemented

the absolute number of customer complaints within the group has been declining for several years a total of
4203 complaints were received in the reporting year this was more than 11 lower than in 2014 and represents
the lowest number since figures were first recorded in 2004 as the wertpapierhaus with more than 36 million
custodial account customers the majority of our complaints arise in connection with the way custodial accounts
are handled

customers can send dekabank a message or lodge a complaint at any time these are then immediately for
warded to the specialist unit concerned where they are processed customers are also free to contact the
ombudsman services of the association of german public banks bundesverband öffentlicher banken
deutschlands  vöb and the association of german investment companies bundesverband deutscher invest
mentgesellschaften  bvi the federal financial supervisory authority bundesanstalt für finanzdienstleistungs
aufsicht  bafin or the regulator in luxembourg  the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf
we received 22 complaints via this route during the reporting year

during the reporting period no complaints were received via formal procedures in relation to the impact of our
activities on ecological matters or human rights or on issues associated with corruption

      political engagement and social engagement
      dekabank follows the principle of lobbying politicians and policymakers only through its membership of
associations and organisations and their activities the same is true of our internal expertise which we make
available to policymakers solely through our membership of such organisations taking account of the interests of
our shareholders

donations to political parties political foundations employers associations or trade unions are forbidden as a
basic principle exemptions may only be made with the approval of the full board of management and there were
no such exceptions in 2015

our focus on serving the common good is an important and mandatory element of the relationship between the
deka group and the savings banks that support it which are fully committed to this principle in the light of this
deka donates to institutions that exclusively and directly serve to promote benevolent charitable and church
causes and that are also authorised to issue confirmations of donations for tax purposes

       innovation management

      following a multistage pilot dekabanks innovation platform opened for normal use in october 2015 it
allows employees to submit ideas for new products or ways in which processes can be improved the crowd
sourcing approach behind the innovation platform allows our staff to get involved in assessing and developing
the published ideas further a fivestar scale has been introduced for employees to use when assessing ideas
ranging from dont like it at all to like it very much the average number of stars combined with the number

                                                                                                                               sustainability report  11




of ratings given gives an indication of how widely the idea is accepted ideally comments can be used to flesh
out ideas further thus improving quality

indications of problems and risks can also be useful to the relevant department at a later stage when it is deciding
whether or not to implement an idea ideas that are particularly creative or valuable from a practical point of view
but that fall slightly short of the required criteria are still forwarded to the relevant department

during 2015 a total of 224 ideas were submitted via the innovation platform and its predecessor the deka idea
database of which 55 were part of a competition run by the board of management of these 28 were awarded
prizes totalling 18000

one idea that was implemented for example involved rounding off amounts on payslips and donating the
remaining cents to the notforprofit organisation hilfe für krebskranke kinder e v support for children with
cancer participation in this donation scheme is voluntary and money is only deducted after an employee has
signed up

           sustainability ratings

       dekabank maintains a dialogue with the independent rating agencies msci sustainalytics oekom research
and imug these agencies regularly evaluate the deka groups sustainability performance the assessments pro
vided by the rating agencies are an important indicator for us in the ongoing development of our sustainability
activities at the end of 2015 deka was assessed for the first time by mscis sustainability division increased
interest in sustainability ratings among investors and our consistently sound rankings confirm that our strategic
approach to sustainability is working the deka group currently has a sustainability rating from the following
agencies

       sustainable products


       as a business lender and investor in global money capital and property markets we have
       a special responsibility our activities must therefore focus not just on the interests of our
       customers but also given our strategic foundation as a member of the sparkassenfinanz
       gruppe on the social and environmental impact of our operations

       for this reason dekabank was the first of the systemically important banks to implement a certified
sustainability filter for its own investments the sustainability filter was developed in collaboration with the
hanoverbased rating agency imug and has been applied to new investments in the treasury banking book since
1 july 2014 the sustainability filter is based on exclusion criteria relating to the environment armaments human
rights ilo core conventions on labour standards and corruption any companies business models or assets that
contravene one or more of the exclusion criteria will no longer be considered for investment as at 31 december
2015 the volume of sustainably managed proprietary investments amounted to 152bn

our range of products and services enables our customers to achieve their individual investment objectives when
it comes to creating and preserving wealth in this prolonged period of low and zero interest rates fundbased
products are the first choice to help them do this

       responsible investment

       when investing on behalf of clients deka always acts in the interest of the investment fund we firmly
believe that in the long term share prices and bond yields are as strongly influenced by environmental and social
factors as they are by business and economic considerations deka therefore takes these aspects into considera
tion in all of its investment decisions dekas standard practice is to avoid investments in companies that manu
facture antipersonnel mines or cluster munitions and does not invest in basic food products this applies to all
the funds it manages

      capitalmarket based investment products
      dekabank began offering private investors products dedicated to sustainable investment back in 2011 with
the dekanachhaltigkeit dekasustainability aktien renten and balance equities bond and balanced funds and

investments amounted to 46112m at the end of 2015 sustainable securities funds accounted for nearly 3
of total assets under management in the securities sector

the dekakirchen dekachurches balance fund which was newly established during the year under review has
a special focus on churchrelated investors parishes official church municipal associations and charitable organ
isations and is based on the investment policies of the catholic and protestant churches alongside ethical and
moral standards their requirements include a sufficient level of investment security an adequate return and the
ability to access the invested funds when needed

with the deka oekem euro nachhaltigkeit ucits etf deka has for the first time launched an etf for institutional
investors that specifically invests in sustainable companies from the eurozone the index underlying the etf is
composed of companies that have an aboveaverage sustainability rating from oekom research ag in terms of
environmental social and governance aspects

                                                                                                                  sustainability report  13

      exercise of voting rights and dialogue with companies
      dekas position on ethical social and ecological issues also influences the way that it exercises its voting
rights representing fund investors interests and exercising their voting rights in companies is a responsibility that
we take very seriously

deka defines its policy in a set of principles on the exercise of voting rights which state that it holds shareholder
voting rights on trust and exercises them on behalf of fund investors either directly or through proxies the prin
ciples also include an undertaking on the part of deka investment gmbh to base its voting behaviour on what it
deems a to be critical achievement or position on the part of a company in terms of social and environmental
responsibility

the principles have been compiled based on dekas extensive experience they take account of applicable legis
lation the latest analysis guidelines for shareholders meetings from the german association for investment and
asset management bundesverband investment und asset management  bvi the german corporate govern
ance code deutscher corporate governance kodex  dcgk and relevant environmental social and governance
esg standards deka generally advocates uniform voting rights in line with the principle one share one vote
it rejects preferential treatment for specific investor groups holding multiple voting rights it also strictly opposes
all actions that lead to restrictions on the rights of shareholders such as maximum voting rights and delegation
rights the principles covering the exercise of voting rights together with information on voting policy and an
overview of dekas voting behaviour during 2015 can be found on its website at wwwdekade

esg environmental social and governance indicators are becoming increasingly important during dialogue with
companies in 2015 deka investment gmbh held some 1600 discussions with companies in whose shares or
other securities its funds have invested

      activities to promote sustainable investment
      through our membership of and active participation in the forum for sustainable financial investments
fng we are supporting an important initiative to inform customers about the opportunities offered by sustain
able investment our sustainability funds are among the fund profiles listed on the fng website

we also support efforts to boost knowledge of sustainability through our involvement in the fund and asset
management association bvi we help to promote the idea of sustainability through talks and published articles
and by supporting customer events hosted by savings banks on the subject of sustainability

       investor information and promoting financial knowledge
       all deka group documents made available to private customers are subject to the regulations summarised
in the groups guidelines on the preparation of advertising and investor information these regulations strictly
prohibit practices such as aggressive marketing or the exploitation of particularly vulnerable customer groups in
this respect our many customers from the municipal sector are also considered to be private customers

in order to promote knowledge of the world of finance and capital markets since 2014 we have acted as a part
ner organisation to support the sparkassenfinanzgruppes stock exchange simulation which is organised by
deutscher sparkassenverlag the stock exchange simulation is the largest in europe for more than 30 years it
has contributed to broadening knowledge about capital markets in particular for young target groups and pro
vides a platform for indepth examination of germanys securities culture

14  sustainable products




during 2015 33442 teams of schoolchildren 1500 teams of apprentices and 3949 undergraduate teams from
across the whole of germany took part in the stock exchange simulation during these projects which lasted
several weeks participants were given the opportunity to try out riskfree equity trading to improve their under
standing of market principles and correctly interpret economic and business news

in 2013 the content of the stock exchange simulation was expanded to include a module on sustainability which
emphasizes investments in sustainable securities the project was officially included in the united nations dec
ade of education for sustainable development with sustainable development in mind each year deka supports
this special programme for promoting young talents in 2015 deka arranged the first national award ceremony
for the undergraduate winners of the stock exchange simulation in frankfurt and in an accompanying pro
gramme helped undergraduates to gain a better understanding of frankfurt as a financial centre the winners
themselves receive a financial grant towards their studies from the german savings banks and giro association

       sustainability in lending business

       sustainable lending business with public and private institutional customers has been an indispensable
component of dekabank deutsche girozentrales dna since its formation as early as in spring 1918 the banks
owners the present day deutsche sparkassen und giroverband stated in its certificate of incorporation that the
new bank should undertake the financing of municipalities and their activities for example almost 100 years
after its foundation the lending business of dekabank deutsche girozentrale comprises three pillars trading and
capital markets activities property financing and project finance

this means that across the entire spectrum of the lending business consideration is given to the guidelines set
out in the business strategy in relation to sustainable corporate governance see section 23 of the business
strategy as a matter of course this means lending in a responsible sustainabilityoriented manner that upholds
the reputation of the bank moreover dekabank conducts lending business almost exclusively with institutional
customers

the credit risk strategy forms the basis for lending business the credit risk strategy stipulates parameters for all
financing activities based on the objectives and guidelines set out in the business strategy

as a matter of principle dekabank will not enter into

         lending transactions of a speculative nature such as highlyleveraged transactions

         financing connected to the arms trade financing of arms shipments or of weapon manufacturers or
          trading companies

         financing of coalfired power stations  in this regard no financing is undertaken of companies
          involved in mountaintop removal mining

         financing of nuclear power stations

         financing in relation to activities that pose a significant threat to the environment for example
          uranium mining see also oecd environmental guidelines

         project financing that does not meet the requirements of the equator principles ep

         financing of speculation on basic foodstuffs

         transactions with a country or lender in a country that is included on the negative list of central
          governments

         venture capital financing

         financing of companies in the pornography sector or comparable sectors eg the sex trade

         financing of manufacturers of substances that are dangerous to health tobacco

                                                                                                                   sustainability report  15




        financing of companies that operate controversial forms of gambling or

        financing of companies that breach internationally recognised principles on human rights and
         employment rights ilo declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work
furthermore dekabank does not enter into financing transactions if it suspects that in doing so it may be sup
porting companies that use forced compulsory or child labour

if an increased sustainability risk is identified the loan request is passed on to experts in dekabanks sustainability
management team for assessment this team will also examine whether based on sociocultural or ethical aspects
the financing itself a business partner the business practice and the country where the company or the risk is
based are in keeping with dekas internal values and guidelines this will naturally also include consideration of
whether public trust in or the reputation of the deka group could be adversely affected over the long term for
example speculative transactions with food products

      project finance excluding property financing
      as at the reporting date our gross loan volume amounted to 643bn the structure was as follows of
gross loan volume 37 was invested in germany 18 in the eu and 13 in other oecd countries while 32
was invested outside of the oecd lending to finance alternative energies wind and solar power amounted to
028bn accounting for around 14 of the gross loan volume of infrastructure financing

        property financing
        the deka groups commercial property financing activities concentrate on transparent markets with exist
ing market liquidity and a stable legal environment which due to their size transparency and liquidity are of
crucial importance for the business division as a whole in those countries where it is possible our basic objective
is for loans to be eligible for inclusion as cover pool assets

alongside traditional investors and project developers at an individual property level the customer focus includes
reits property companies pension funds and german openended property investment funds

as at the end of the reporting year deka had property financing business in australia germany france great
britain italy ireland japan canada singapore and the usa with a loan volume of around 62bn including
financing for our openended property funds and publicsector construction projects economic efficiency and
environmental and social responsibility are obligatory selection criteria for property lending business these
aspects are explicitly assessed when entering into any new business and form part of the due diligence review
sustainability certificates from independent accreditation bodies such as the building research establishment
environmental assessment method breeam or other internationally recognised seals provide support for this
process in general in addition to benefitting from energyefficient operation sustainable properties have better
rental prospects thirdparty usage and exhibit better value retention this is reflected in the position of the
lender with respect to collateral

      capital markets business division
      the capital markets business division is the central product solution and infrastructure provider as well as
a service provider and driver of innovation in capital markets business its business activities focus on generating
customerdriven business within the triangle comprising savings banks dekabank and group subsidiaries and
selected counterparties and business partners such as external asset managers banks insurance companies and
pension funds furthermore the business division fulfils the deka groups broader role as a risk and liquidity
platform the capital markets business division is also able to offer selected business partners traditional credit
products

      dialogue with customers

      dialogue with savings bank customers and institutional investors is a high priority for dekabank we con
duct detailed customer surveys on a regular basis every two years for savings banks and institutional customers
and every three years for retail customers and discuss the results with the management boards executive staff
and customer advisers of the savings banks the combined results of this process form the basis for optimising

16  sustainable products




our product and service offering the insights into investor trends provide important inspiration and ideas for
developing our sustainable products

in 2015 we conducted our regular survey of retail customers with a total of 741 customers taking part in the
online questionnaire the customer satisfaction index calculated on the basis of the survey results reached its
highest level since the inception of these surveys in 2003 at 58 points it significantly exceeded the most recent
comparative result from 2012 49 points this was also the case for the customer loyalty index which rose by
8 points against 2012 to a total of 66 points

when asked about their overall level of satisfaction 89 of respondents rated deka as excellent very good
or good which again represented a significant improvement on the 2012 results percentage of respondents
77

the next survey of institutional customers aimed at management boards depot a managers and treasury man
agers among others and savings banks aimed at management boards executive staff and customer advisers
will take place during 2016

           sales support and cooperation with the savings banks

      the german savings banks are dekabanks primary customers with a network covering almost the entire
country they provide a germanywide platform for investments within the sparkassenfinanzgruppe the sav
ings banks are responsible for providing local investment advice to private customers dekabank supports them
in many different ways and in all phases of their advisory and investment process such as by providing advisers
with information on investment products or on market developments dekabanks sales consultants work on site
at the savings banks and help to ensure highquality advice for instance by providing training and coaching for
advisers in addition we take some of the pressure off them by continuing to develop advisory tools to help them
meet the increased documentation requirements thus leaving them more time to give individual tailored advice

we also maintain ongoing dialogue on the subject of sustainability and sustainable investment with interested
parties including savings banks regional associations landesbanken training institutions from the savings bank
organisation and the dsgv joint investment seminars with speakers from dekabank have proved doubly bene
ficial savings bank customers have the opportunity to learn about different forms of responsible investment
while dekabank discovers more about customers needs

           sustainability in the real estate business division

       the real estate business division has converted dekas principles on sustainable corporate governance into
a sustainability strategy that is specific to its own business division at its core are 19 measures which are to be
implemented by the end of 2016 during the year under review the business division continued to make progress
in this regard key aspects for our operating activities include a general reduction of co2 consumption increased
inclusion of green clauses in property facility and rental contracts the reduction of incidental expenses through
sustainable management and renovations aimed at reducing energy consumption and firmly embedding esg
components in processes related to property and fund management accompanying our activities with strong
communication and presenting them via internal and external media are further important elements

      a metastudy carried out by irebs centre of excellence for sustainability in the property
      sector provides proof of the added value created by sustainability 2
      up until now there had been no documentation or study that provided a broad overview of existing find
ings on the benefits of sustainable development from a german perspective in relation to openended property
investment funds or property and which focused specifically on this business model this was thus the starting
point for the current study which fills this research gap



2
     metastudy sustainability versus returns the implications of sustainable business management for openended property investment funds using deka immobil
     ien investment gmbh and westinvest gmbh as examples irebs centre of excellence for sustainability in the property sector

                                                                                                                  sustainability report  17




as part of a metastudy the above issue was discussed in depth and implications for openended mutual prop
erty funds were derived from empirical and theoretical research the study was conducted using openended
mutual property funds issued and managed by deka immobilien investment gmbh and westinvest gmbh as
examples

for the first time the metastudy included research and evaluations based on 70 scientific studies on sustainabil
ity it examined and explained the added value of a focus on sustainable development at individual property
portfolio and company level incorporating both national and international findings for various types of use all
the studies confirmed that the potential benefits quantifiably exceed the additional costs

the key point is that only by quantifying added value for example in the form of increased market value can
investment in sustainability initiatives such as in renovation aimed at reducing energy consumption be justified
both the metastudy and a specific analysis of the certified sustainable property portfolio of the capital manage
ment companies deka immobilien investment gmbh and westinvest gmbh reach the conclusion that broadly
speaking a stronger focus on sustainability is also beneficial from a financial perspective on the revenue side
there are both implicit benefits in the form of financial added value as a result of the impact of sustainable devel
opment on rental rates and purchase prices and explicit benefits due to the increased appeal for potential inves
tors on the cost side there can be reductions due to energy savings for example

requirements in relation to the sustainability of buildings will continue to increase as a result of progressive cli
mate change diminishing resources ongoing rigorous regulation and changes in consumer behaviour in this
context many of the existing portfolio properties from the heterogeneous property market will not be viable in
the future and will gradually lose ground in competition for tenants markdowns in price due to nonsustainabil
ity a socalled grey discount have already been observed in markets where sustainability certificates are more
established there are also signs of this in germany

in the view of irebs the overall property sectors commitment to sustainability still has plenty of room for
improvement despite all the efforts and successes to date this makes the deka groups business and fund focus
on sustainability all the more important as an additional cornerstone for safeguarding longterm commercial
viability in a highly competitive market environment

      key features of sustainable property portfolio management 3
      when managing their funds our property capital management companies kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaf
ten  kvgs take into consideration sustainable principles solely in the interest of their investors the principles of
the real estate business divisions sustainability strategy include translating the diverse obligations into the organ
isational and structural management of the property portfolio and making them an integral component a vital
part of this is the operationalisation of the sustainability strategy through a package of measures

increasingly sustainability activities are already firmly embedded in processes when managing its properties
sustainable property management is a priority for the real estate business division we work with rating agencies
such as scope in order to be a reliable source of support for investors by facilitating and improving comparison
of products sustainability features

we also promote the topic of sustainability through our work with industry associations for instance the real
estate business division is represented at the german property federation zentraler immobilienausschuss  zia
in its energy and building technology green rental agreements csr and benchmarking working groups
at the bvi in its investing responsibly and sustainability in property funds working groups and is involved in
the corporate governance initiative to draft guidelines for socially sustainable corporate governance

     certifications
     our property kvgs make use of sustainability certificates as proof of compliance with sustainability criteria
these include the building research establishment environmental assessment method breeam leadership in
energy and environmental design leed and the german sustainable building council deutsche gesellschaft für
nachhaltiges bauen  dgnb they seek the highest possible level of certification while never losing sight of the
economic context

certification by an independent accreditation body allows investors and tenants to consider environmental and
social elements when choosing properties in addition to economic concerns for many commercial tenants cer
tification of their rental property is also a condition of signing a lease agreement in addition occupying a suitably
certified property helps the lessee company achieve its own sustainability objectives

we increased our holdings of certified property assets by around 10 during the reporting year a total of
169 properties with a value of around 166bn had been certified by the end of the 2015 reporting year of which
81 properties alone are in germany with a volume of around 56bn leader among the large cities is frankfurt
this means that as at the end of 2015 around 60 of the entire property assets held in deka funds had been
certified

among the successful certifications of properties in our dekaimmobilien europa mutual fund that of the eleven
property in central hamburg stands out in particular as well as making investments in water efficiency and the pro
tection of nonsmokers achieving this result required the participation of the tenants the sustainability of the loca
tion is demonstrated by the fact that 75 of tenants make use of public transport the property carries the gold leed
sustainability seal during the 2015 calendar year the number of certified properties in the dekaimmobilien europa
fund reached a total of 80 following the addition of 20 new certificates

one of the properties from the portfolio of the dekaimmobilien global mutual fund carries the highest current
rating for an office building awarded by the sustainability seal breeam outstanding the building the edge
in the zuidas district of amsterdam was built in 2014 and received a number of awards for its innovative technical
design features such as lighting and temperature that can be individually adjusted by smartphone

during the reporting year 2015 the westinvest interselect property fund increased its certification rate by almost
10 as planned to 62 the certifications of eleven properties in the portfolio and the disposal of six uncerti
fied buildings both contributed to this rise one certification worth highlighting in particular is that of the hürth
park shopping centre in hürth near cologne which was awarded a breeamdeportfolio certificate with the
rating very good around two months after its acquisition

meanwhile the westinvest immovalue fund obtained a strong breeaminuse certification with a good rat
ing for the helfmannpark 1 property in eschborn renewal of the central cooling system in 2013 has led to
annual energy savings of 25 in the course of renovating the facade heat leakages were identified and any
damp penetration removed

       renewable energy
       at properties held in the portfolios of property funds managed by deka companies the main forms of
renewable energy currently in use are power generated from photovoltaic plants heat generation from ground
or airsource heat pumps hot water production from solar thermal energy and well installations for supplying
cooling systems green energy sources are used to supply power for the communal areas of almost all german
properties the concept of renewable energy plays an extremely important role during renovation work

      external ratings reaffirm focus on sustainability
      dekas sustainability efforts are also being recognised by external bodies during the year under review in its
annual evaluation of all relevant openended property funds in germany the scope rating agency once again
attested to our funds strong focus on sustainability and a major improvement in the certification rate of our invest
ment portfolios this was seen as a positive attribute as it helps to preserve the properties value and ensure their
marketability

                                                                                                                                                                 sustainability report  19

professional experience of seasoned managers in order to advance their own selfdevelopment and to take a
leadership role themselves in the future

           resource management and the employer brand

      deka has committed itself to filling all vacancies with internal candidates where possible and to supporting
internal appointments in general this chimes with our efforts to rigorously promote the continued development
of our employees and a clear focus for our hr strategy  having the right employee in the right place the hr
 organisation corporate centre plays a leading role in supporting this matching process the job change rate 4
within the deka group amounted to 528 over the course of the year for certain target groups at the bank
such as apprentices or junior staff specific matching processes have been implemented

the management forum used to fill vacant managerial roles was launched in 2014 and has since been improved
on an ongoing basis this sees candidates attend a standard interview which is led by managerial staff from the
specialist department and closely connected departments moderated by the hr  organisation corporate centre
this procedure contributes to a sound decisionmaking process at management level

we see the staff turnover rate as one of a number of quantitative indicators for the success of resource manage
ment and the cultivation of our employer brand

the domestic staff turnover rate 5 remained very low in 2015 for the first time the average length of service
reached more than ten years in 2015

      as at the reporting date 31 december 2015 the number of apprentices and trainees within the deka
group in germany including student scholarships stood at 75 previous year 61 the number of apprentices and
trainees is determined in line with the current requirement deka strives to be able to offer continuing employ
ment to all apprentices and trainees once their apprenticeship or training has been successfully completed during
the year under review all apprentices and trainees who had completed their apprenticeships and training pro

our personnel development strategy includes treating interns fairly and providing them with appropriate support
deka participates in the fair company initiative run by the handelsblatt publishing group and as part of this ini
tiative is committed to providing undergraduates with interesting tasks during their internship and a fair chance
of permanent employment

      further training

       individual development paths are agreed based on the areas for development that have been identified
this is done at least once a year as part of the threestage employee appraisal agreeing targets discussing mile
stones and appraising achievement of targets employees and managerial staff have a wide range of tools at their
disposal for this purpose which are continually updated in line with the banks requirements and strategy

during 2015 the karrieredeka careersdeka programme aimed at preparing junior staff to take on spe
cialist management and project leadership responsibilities was comprehensively revised our internal potential
assessment centre was also overhauled the centre conducts personal performance assessments for employees
who show the potential to take on additional responsibility within their current roles in addition dekabank has
designed a new trainee programme for university graduates

training offered may either form part of an individuals professional activities or be unrelated to their work this
can include seminars as well as longer training courses that lead to a certificate the range of further training on
offer includes seminars aimed at developing interpersonal methodological and social skills furthermore provid
ing information on and raising awareness of sustainability issues are key parts of the training offered

deka supports internal and external training for employees both financially and by releasing them from work
when required the training programmes and seminars offered are constantly evaluated based on satisfaction
learning success transfer success and benefit there are two stages to an evaluation participants are asked for
their first impressions shortly after the training session and are then questioned once more about the event four
months later this second round of questioning focuses on the practical use and benefit of the training content
the respective managers of participants are also questioned at the same time

monitoring of training activities also contributes to more indepth exchanges of views between managers and
employees on learning objectives and knowledge transfer activities which in turn makes an important contribu
tion to continuous improvements in management culture

the average financial cost of further training in germany during the reporting year amounted to 1001 per active
employee previous year 1170 this figure does not include the cost of further training that took place as part
of projects the reduction in financial expenditure for further training is explained by more favourably priced
training courses as well as by stronger on the job development which focuses on internal knowledge sharing
for example through work shadowing

      open dialogue with employee representatives

      our employees are represented by staff committees and works councils germany and by the comité mixte
luxembourg they are informed at an early stage of any forthcoming changes and are involved in shaping the
actual change process dekas hr  organisation corporate centre engages in respectful open dialogue with
employee representatives in addition an employee representative is available for consultation once a week

      worklife balance

      as part of its social and corporate responsibility deka aims to use its lifecyclebased hr management
approach to create an environment that makes an employees career progression as compatible as possible with
the needs and requirements of his or her private life this applies especially to employees who have or are plan
ning to have children and to those with responsibilities towards family members in need of care

all employees regardless of where they are based have access to advisory and arrangement services in relation
to childcare and nursing care

flexible working hours are a further element of the efforts being made to guarantee an appropriate worklife
balance overall dekas employees make use of more than 330 different working time models the proportion
of parttime staff has been rising steadily for several years over the long term comparative figure in 2002 62

       remuneration

      dekas remuneration system is based on our longterm corporate strategy it is reviewed on an annual basis
to ensure it is in line with current regulation and where necessary updated to reflect currently applicable regula
tory requirements it offers incentives for strong performance on a sustainable basis whilst avoiding any that
would encourage employees to assume disproportionate risks on behalf of deka detailed information can be
found in the deka groups remuneration report at wwwdekade

remuneration is based solely on the employees role and performance the increasing trend towards positions for
highly skilled employees is also reflected in the development of the employee pay scale breakdown with the
proportion of both nonpayscale employees and employees in the higher pay bands growing steadily

deka employees remuneration can be supplemented with variable components these are granted based on
performance taking into account both the performance of the individual employee and the success of the deka
group as a basic principle deka does not make a distinction between parttime and fulltime staff in terms of
the benefits it provides

for employees whose activities have a material impact on dekas overall risk profile riskrelevant employees the
variable portion of the remuneration involves assessments and payments spread over several years deferrals in line
with regulatory requirements

a groupwide evaluation of staff conduct on the basis of the deka groups code of ethics has been introduced
as a new component of performancebased remuneration this has also placed even greater focus on good con
duct towards clients owners and colleagues

in line with regulatory requirements a variable remuneration component cannot exceed 100 of the fixed compo
nent pursuant to section 25a of the german banking act kreditwesengesetz  kwg this upper limit to the vari
able component can be increased to 200 of the fixed component by shareholders resolution however during
the year under review dekabank did not make use of the option to increase the upper limit for variable remuneration
components for the members of its board of management or any other employees of the bank all salaries paid by
deka are as a matter of principle at least at the level of the statutory minimum wage for the most part however
they significantly exceed this level

           sustainable bankingenvironmental management


           deka has resolved to step up its environmental activities it intends to make an active contribu
           tion towards the settlement agreed at the cop21 climate conference in paris on 12 december
           2015 representatives of more than 170 countries have since signed the paris climate agreement
           thereby undertaking to limit global warming to a manageable level the goal is to restrict it to
           an increase of considerably less than two degrees relative to preindustrial levels and ideally to
           15 degrees in future deka will focus even more vigorously on reducing its energy consumption
           and the level of business travel

      thanks to the numerous measures it has already implemented deka has already achieved a high standard
in terms of making its operations as environmentally friendly as possible this is demonstrated by the fact that its
environmental management system was recertified by an external environmental auditor in 2015

           din en 16247 energy audit

      on 5 november 2014 the german federal cabinet adopted a draft bill to implement the eu energy effi
ciency directive eed which was transposed into german law at the end of april 2015 since that time all com
panies that do not qualify as smes small and mediumsized enterprises  and therefore deka  are required to
undergo an energy audit under din en 16247 every four years the energy audit is an advisory audit which aims
to establish a companys overall energy efficiency and identify steps that can be taken to improve it resulting in
a better energy footprint for the company

in advance of the energy audit deka set up an energy management task force spanning every business unit
the task force carried out preparatory work and provided support for the audit process along with the environ
mental management team the task force also included senior staff from the real estate business division to make
sure that key data about the buildings to be audited was available

working with independent energy auditors from the firm drees  sommer the specified properties were then
subjected to a detailed audit we were therefore able to carry out an energy audit under din en 16247 during
the reporting year as required by law and were one of the first central giro associations girozentralen to do so
drees  sommers final report certifies that all buildings are in very good condition from both a structural and
technical point of view and there is essentially little need for improvement

deka already completed a gradual process of converting the lighting at the trianon and prisma buildings to more
energyefficient led bulbs in 2014 and 2015 including external areas the trianon pyramid and logos floors
dedicated to conference facilities corridors and lift lobbies from 2016 75 of the electricity supplied to the
buildings at the frankfurt site will come from green sources from 2016 onwards deka already uses 100 green

      the most recent review in 2016 showed that 240 suppliers have signed a dekabank sustainability declara
tion around 82 of our order volume was placed with german suppliers in 2015 the total procurement volume
was approximately 26764m6 we currently do not use any overseas service providers7

           supplier audits

       a risk assessment procedure within the purchasing process ensures that the relevant purchaser checks
whether there is an entry in the risk database before any supplier is commissioned dekabank has corresponding
risk reports on the providers involved for around 80 of the volume spent suppliers are subject to audits and a
clearlydefined procedure has been set up to rectify any infringements of sustainability regulations and reach an
agreement between deka and the supplier concerned if no agreement is reached the matter is escalated to the
head of sustainability management the same applies if the audit identifies any infringements

as a basic principle all new suppliers are required to enter mandatory information about their environmental
protection measures during selfregistration via the electronic purchasing portal information entered on each
supplier and service provider is then clearly available for all buyers to use during negotiations

we also carry out regular audits of the disposal companies we use in order to ensure that waste is disposed of
safely and in an environmentally friendly manner all of our disposal companies are drawn from the local area and
hold the relevant certifications all contracted waste disposal companies hold certification as specialists in waste
disposal in line with the german lifecycle management act kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz

           environmental and social standards

       when inviting tenders for building management services we ensure that suppliers abide by international
environmental and social standards preference is given to service providers with an industrystandard certifica
tion eg emas or iso 14001 or a recognised environmental certification contractors also undertake to perform
the services in accordance with a quality management system complying with iso 9001 and subsequent stand
ards as a general principle specified tasks must be carried out in such a way that the health of those using the
building is not put at risk and that minimum environmental requirements and statutory health and safety regula
tions are met

across all product categories at the present time the deka group has no connections with suppliers suspected
of using forced compulsory or child labour and who therefore do not comply with the ilos core labour stand
ards by including requirements specifically covering such matters in the sustainability declaration that we require
suppliers to sign we can also be confident that none of our suppliers have breached the principle of freedom of
association

           din en iso 14001 environmental management system

     on the basis of environmental guidelines agreed with the board of management the deka group employs
a wide range of measures in every business division to protect the environment and ensure that resources are
handled in an environmentally sound way

since 2009 the deka group has put in place a systematic standardised framework for environmental protection
within the company by introducing an environmental management system in line with the recognised din en iso
14001 standard and using sectorspecific metrics as set out by the association for environmental management and
sustainability in financial institutions verein für umweltmanagement und nachhaltigkeit in finanzinstituten e v 
vfu these steps also underpin the groups commitment to continually improving environmental protection

in addition the group bases its recording and monitoring of relevant environmental data on the greenhouse gas
protocol 8 the environmental management system includes an annual environmental programme in which the
group sets environmental targets for its main areas of activity and determines how these are to be implemented
cutting energy consumption and reducing the number of business trips and hence also achieving the target of a
5 annual reduction in co2 remains a priority in addition deka aspires to operate the bank in a climateneutral
manner and has also enshrined this goal in its code of ethics

data relevant to our environmental balance sheet such as information on energy consumption or emissions is
recorded and monitored in a central database this allows us to quickly identify areas where there is potential for
improvement or where upgrades are required it also forms the basis for the annual calculation of our greenhouse
gas emissions and co2 footprint the calculation allows us to verify whether the environmental programme and
the measures it includes are an appropriate and effective way to achieve the groups environmental goals

the data on energy use and consumption of resources see figs 16 to 20 at the end of this section published as
part of this sustainability report is based on analysis of the 201415 figures which were evaluated in february 2016

this was that the vfu revised the emission factors that we use as the basis for calculating our greenhouse gas
emissions9 even so there was a considerable rise 15 in total business travel in 2014 although we achieved a
total reduction of 2 in 2015 this was only enough to offset a small portion of that rise travel by road rose
particularly sharply with 677000 additional kilometres driven this is due to a substantial increase in sales staff
whose numbers rose by around 200 in 2014 and 2015 because the savings banks and their branches can often
not be reached by train or other local public transport each new employee received a company car in 2014 there
was also a sharp rise in shorthaul flights which increased by around 36 231007km and again by roughly 11
257680km in 2015 the increase was caused by a number of factors including efforts to build up business
relationships in berlin which called for a very large number of onsite meetings

a number of concrete measures to combat the rise in greenhouse gas emissions have been planned for 2016
onwards we are also very closely observing the activities underway to develop the climate action plan 2050
which is being drawn up by the german government on the basis of the paris climate conference as a first step
we are increasing the proportion of green electricity we use at our frankfurt site from 25 to 75 we are also
seeking to reduce the use of flights for domestic travel by creating targeted measures and incentives to use alter
native means of transport or video conferencing for example in terms of fleet management for our company
cars we are also considering alternative drive technologies such as electric vehicles more closely

deka already determines co2 consumption for selected investment funds these reports are taken into account
by fund managers when evaluating funds in the long term dekabank would also like to implement co2 reports
for finance it extends as part of its lending business taken together these measures constitute the basis for a
solid mediumterm climate strategy which should more than live up to the requirements of the governments
climate action plan 2050 if however greenhouse gas emissions should continue to rise it would only be possi
ble to meet our objective of operating the bank in a climateneutral way if we were to implement largescale
compensation measures

on a positive note we have managed to reduce the amount of paper per employee  by 5 in 2014 and 13 in
2015 in addition we reduced the total volume of waste generated by 77 in 2015 to 3256 tonnes in 2014
total waste rose by 381 the sharp rise in 2014 was due to comprehensive fire protection measures imple
mented in the trianon building which continued into 2015 the demolition of the ta10 building also accounted
for a further rise the introduction of a waste sorting system in the office kitchen areas in the prisma building from
the end of 2014 was another factor behind the reduction achieved in 2015 this also led to a 12 increase in the
recycling rate which now stands at 66

  	in particular the emission factor for district heating doubled from 27333 kgfy 2014 to 538 kgfy 2015 there was also a substantial increase in the factor
    for road travel which rose from 0089 kgfy 2015 to 0142 kgfy 2015

    ghg emissions are calculated for the sites in frankfurt as well as for dekabank germany and the deka group as a whole including its sites in germany

      corporate citizenship


      supporting notforprofit institutions and organisations lies at the core of the sparkassen
      finanzgruppes brand dekabank complements this by focusing its efforts on supporting
      architecture academia culture sport and the arts it concentrates its work in these areas on
      actions that have an impact across the whole of germany either working alone or with other
      institutions in the sparkassenfinanzgruppe

      package of measures for refugees

       more than a million people sought refuge in germany during 2015 such a large number of people places
considerable extra demands on society dekabank believes it has a responsibility to act and has put in place a
threetier package of measures aimed in particular at making a meaningful contribution to integrating refugees
into local communities primarily in the rhinemain region

as part of the first stage of an emergency aid programme that has been in place since september 2015 employ
ees are able to apply for a donation of 1000 to support voluntary work with refugees by the end of 2015 a
total of 64 donations had already been made to notforprofit organisations focusing on helping refugees this
emergency aid programme will continue in 2016

secondly we are expanding our partnership with freundeskreis arche frankfurt e v  which has been in place
since 2008  to include a new project in view of the current situation the arche intends to build a new facility
in griesheim close to the existing arche centre in the area which is located in the bertoldotto primary school
as well as caring for children from all social backgrounds the arche has also been looking after the needs of
refugee children and their families for a long time now the primary goal is to facilitate the social integration of
between 80 and 100 children and young people aged from 12 to 17 so as to carry on the successful work under
taken at the primary school

the initial donation the deka group made in 2015 will ensure that the new facility is fully funded for three years
experts from deka immobilien gmbh are also providing support for the planning and execution of the construc
tion project the facility is expected to be completed in 2016

thirdly in december 2015 the deka group informed the employment agency agentur für arbeit in frankfurt
that the bank would take on 20 interns in both 2016 and 2017 from among the refugees as long as certain min
imum standards can be met each internship will last for a year senior figures at the frankfurt employment
agency have praised this pledge which commits us to creating additional jobs in the agencys catchment area
calling it exemplary especially given that it was made so early on

34  independent environmental assurance statement




      independent environmental assurance statement


        dekabank engaged agimus gmbh umweltgutachterorganisation und beratungsgesellschaft an environmental verification
provider and consultancy to perform a review of its 2015 sustainability report in terms of materiality transparency and compara
bility it is the responsibility of the board of management to ensure that key indicators on sustainability performance are appropri
ately determined and presented in accordance with the reporting criteria including the appropriate identification of significant
issues our responsibility is to verify that the statements made in the sustainability report are transparent and complete pursuant
to the criteria set out in the gri global reporting initiative g4 sustainability reporting guidelines

      independence and quality assurance of the environmental verification provider

       we observed the independence requirements for environmental verification providers as well as further professional ethical
requirements for third party reviews and conducted our review of the sustainability report in line with the procedures for the
certification of the environmental management system set out in iso 14001

      scope of assurance engagement

      it is our responsibility based on the procedures that we have performed to express an opinion as to whether any matters
have come to our attention that lead us to conclude that the information in dekabanks sustainability report for the 2015 financial
year has not in all material respects been prepared in accordance with the criteria set out in the gri g4 sustainability reporting
guidelines we were also engaged to make recommendations on the further development of the environmental management
system and sustainability reporting based on the results of our environmental verification review

when conducting our review we observed the professional practice guidelines for environmental verification providers in doing
so we planned and performed our engagement with due regard to the principle of materiality in order to express our opinion with
a limited level of assurance

in an environmental verification engagement with limited assurance the procedures performed are less comprehensive than those
required for an engagement providing reasonable assurance such that accordingly a lower level of assurance is obtained the
selection of verification procedures is at the professional discretion of the environmental verifier the procedures selected were in
line with those required for iso 14001 certification both technically and in terms of content within the scope of our environmen
tal verification review we conducted the following procedures amongst others

         interviewed employees from the departments responsible for the preparation of the report about the process for
          preparing the report and on the internal controls in place around this process

         inspected documents regarding the sustainability strategy and gained an understanding of the environmental and
          sustainability management structure stakeholder dialogue and the development process for the companys
          environmental and sustainability programme

         interviewed employees in the specialist departments responsible for individual sections of the report

         reviewed and tested on a sample basis the procedures and the system and process documentation in relation to the
          collection analysis validation and aggregation of the sustainability data

         conducted an audit and onsite inspection at the frankfurt am main office

         aggregated selected data performed an analytical review of data included in the report

         obtained further evidence to support selected information in the report through inspection of internal documents as
          well as reports and records from external service providers

      opinion

      on the basis of the review that we have performed to obtain limited assurance no matters have come to our attention that
lead us to conclude that the information in the sustainability report for the 2015 financial year has not in all material respects
been prepared in accordance with the criteria set out in the gri g4 sustainability reporting guidelines

                                                                                                                 sustainability report  35




a materiality study was carried out in the autumn of 2015 involving 2699 participants drawn from the stakeholder groups of
employees customers experts and others a summary of the results is now available and this concludes that the banks stakehold
ers attach greater importance to the areas of sustainable corporate governance and customer relationships and sustainable
products as a result the areas of business ecology and corporate citizenship were presented in a more compact manner this
is an understandable and transparent change which is also acceptable from an environmental verification point of view particularly
given that after seven continuous years of iso 14001 certification the area of business ecology has a secure foundation

during the preparation of the report relevant topics were assessed for materiality and both upstream and downstream organisa
tional units were taken into consideration the report includes all information that should be deemed material with due consider
ation given to the principles of materiality sustainability context and stakeholder involvement

according to the results of our review no information has been omitted from the report that could potentially influence the assess
ments or decisions of stakeholders or that might reflect significant economic ecological and social impacts the report discloses
both positive and to the extent that these exist negative events

the use of gri indicators as well as additional sectorspecific criteria facilitates the comparability of the report the sustainability
report meets the requirements of the core in accordance option and also fulfils approximately 90 of the requirements for the
comprehensive option one of the indicators la9 could only be determined in monetary value as opposed to time value as
required by the standard the process for compiling the data should be amended the scope covered by the 2015 sustainability
report thus demonstrates that dekabank is willing to allow its sustainability performance to be compared with that of other leading
financial institutions

      supplementary information and recommendations

       dekabanks commitment to integrating sustainable development into its core business far exceeds normal practice in the
sector it is commendable that dekabank has signed the un global compact and the equator principles and has thus made a
voluntary pledge to uphold internationally recognised principles in the areas of human rights labour standards environmental
protection and anticorruption the progress achieved in the implementation of these principles is also described in the sustaina
bility report the mandatory introduction in 2014 of an internal code of ethics for all dekabank employees and third parties
acting on behalf of dekabank also clearly underlines the importance the bank places on the issue of sustainability sustainability
criteria are consistently observed when making investment and financing decisions

we welcome the fact that the bank has elected not to formulate a separate sustainability strategy since 2015 this decision rein
forces its aim of embedding sustainability throughout the whole value chain and hence approaching it as an integral part of the
business model in addition to the external verification of its compliance with gri guidelines dekabank is evaluated by other
specialist rating agencies thereby facilitating its comparison with other banks furthermore this allows all of dekabanks stake
holders to gain a clear picture of the successes and potential difficulties experienced in the implementation of sustainability prin
ciples without qualifying the conclusion of our review presented above we have the following recommendations on the further
development of the banks sustainability reporting

in general terms there is still considerable scope to increase the level of detail involved in the reporting of some indicators while
the results of the stakeholder survey clearly show that operational environmental indicators are of less interest than businessre
lated aspects

the increase in greenhouse gas emissions is not satisfactory and is not in line with the banks overarching sustainability ambitions
however we are pleased to note that the bank is addressing this issue by undertaking a clear analysis of its causes and introducing
a package of measures to counter the rise in ghg emissions progress made in this area should be presented in the next report
