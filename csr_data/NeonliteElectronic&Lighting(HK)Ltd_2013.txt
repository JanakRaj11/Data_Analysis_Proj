                                              temperature and its control have a significant impact on the quality and lifespan
                                              of led lamps to ensure leds operate at their optimum capabilities effective
                                              thermal management is essential

                                              many directional led lamps on the market today incorporate multiple lenses with
                                              which to direct light output however these tend to cause more glare and visual
                                              noise from the multiple shadows megaman led directional light sources do
                                              not use lenses but reflectors to direct the light output megaman led reflectors
                                              create a clean superior quality beam of light

                                              a unique design of heat drain across the reflector to dissipate heat efficiently
                                              and prevent deterioration of the led and other components the technology
                                              gives the lamps a longer life with lumen maintenance resulting in 70 of initial
                                              lumens being available even at the end of the lamp life thanks to careful thermal

                                              the key to creating an led lighting scheme that looks good for years to come
                                              is in ensuring that over their lifespan all of the lamps are performing within an
                                              acceptable tolerance in terms of colour deviation to define acceptable tolerance
                                              from lamp to lamp led manufacturers have adopted the macadam ellipse
                                              and sdcm standard deviation of colour matching measurement of colour
                                              consistency

                                              the macadam ellipse is a system of colour measurement it measures how much
                                              colour variation is possible around these axes before the human eye detects a
                                              colour change a series of ellipses can then be drawn around any target colour
                                              and the closer any given lamp is to the target the less colour deviation will be
                                              experienced when these lamps are placed side by side in an installation

                                              the distance from the target point in each ellipse is measured in sdcm an sdcm
                                              of 1 step means that there is no colour difference between led chips 23 sdcm
                                              means that there is hardly any visible colour difference colour consistency of 67

                                              thanks to megamans control of the phosphorled blend and the optimized
                                              control its led light sources have prominent performance in this area by having
                                              a colour consistency of 35 sdcm

                                              given a high priority when adopting a value orientation the purchasing strategy
                                              must link to overall business goals and objectives we must respond to customer
                                              needs to achieve the distinctive and sustainable competitive advantages eg

                                              customer service we identify the core values of the purchasing strategy as
                                              follows

                                              supplier optimization the company chooses an optimum mix of vendors who
                                              can provide the best prices and terms it requires the suppliers to provide an ever
                                              increasing quality service in order to ensure purchasing best practices

                                              risk management evaluation on suppliers should not only rely on price
                                              advantages but also which supplier would be most reliable and offer the best
                                              quality within a reasonable price range production activities and support services
                                              must be under continued review to assess competitiveness

                                              green purchasing this strategy champions the need for recycling and

                                              will choose the purchasing strategy that promotes our procurement best practices
                                              of minimizing costs maximizing quality and ensuring that quality products are
                                              delivered on time

                                              different product groups require different purchasing strategies in neonlite
                                              product groups and the supplier base are analyzed using two criteria purchasing
                                              impact on profitability and the supply risk associated with the purchased items
                                              quality is always the top priority in the supply of goods in our procurement
                                              operations for key components like led chips suppliers are obliged to have
                                              100 indemnification on all led chips supplied to us in case of patent infringement
                                              in fact patent issues are crucial to our sustainable business

                                              strategic purchasing also involves building rapport between suppliers working
                                              together it may be possible to streamline the advance time needed to process
                                              an order with the supplier thus reducing the need to maintain a larger inventory
                                              production activities and support services must be under continued review
                                              to assess competitiveness for example key supplier audits are executed in
                                              accordance with the stringent requirements of the iso 14001 program and the

                                              and reviewed in addition our suppliers are obligated to follow anticorruption and
                                              bribery laws in the same way that we do

                                              this program involves both led lamps and cfl at the beginning there were
                                              too many cfl models in the same product range resulting in scattered order
                                              for an abundance of models the erp system becomes very bulky and hence

                                              paper etc we recorded 159730 tons of combined recycled waste in 2011 with
                                              a significant drop of 627 as compared to 427666 tons in 2010 the figure is
                                              further decreased by 131 to 138795 tons in 2012 the company passes on
                                              nonreusable waste for disposal this includes the majority of hazardous waste
                                              and nonreusable miscellaneous water the waste is disposed by landfilling

                                              emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of solvents from the
                                              operation of equipment are virtually negligible owing to the low volumes involved
                                              and are not recorded measures undertaken by the company to cut ghg
                                              emissions are based primarily on optimizing material and energy consumption in
                                              the production process

                                              we have set a target to reduce the ghg emissions at production plants by 2020
                                              to be further reduced by 20 per cent as compared to 2012

                                                    two years this was primarily due to the reduction of excess capacity of cfl

                                              city lighting is unevenly distributed while wellheeled business districts and busy
                                              tourist areas are brightly lit many pockets of the city are underlit after dark this
                                              limits local trade and the use of public space undermining economic activity

                                              in the first year of the study architect megan charnley worked with local
                                              communities on the historic boundary estate in london to explore how an

                                              research led to the proposal of a nighttime neighbourhood network of brightly

                                              the study negotiated a permanent lighting setup on an underused sports pitch on
                                              the boundary estate two selfilluminating football goalposts were developed for
                                              a group of local boys who live on the estate and have nowhere to play after dark

                                              the project worked closely with a local youth club to develop and install the
                                              goalposts in order to assess the practical performance and social benefit of the

                                              pitch a number of new requests were made by local residents for the system to
                                              be introduced in other parts of the estate the intention is that the led light tube
