                       consumers webstore and other digital services are a key development             t          ry
                       area to us in sweden the ecommerce is rapidly growing and was in 2016                 eve
                       already over four per cent of total pharmacy sales we were able to further
                       grow our traded goods and otc share of the sales in sweden and also our
                       webstore grew strongly especially during the final quarter i believe that the new
                       year will be interesting due to both increasing competition and strong growth in
                       ecommerce

                       during 2016 there was a lively discussion in finland about the development needs
                       of the pharmacy market in the light of the stated arguments on the matter it is clear
                       that there is much potential for development patient safety is on a good level in
                       finland and it is important to regulate the pharmacy operations in the future at least
                       as well as currently it is also an undisputed fact that the regulation concerning phar
                       macy ownership makes it difficult to increase efficiency and unnecessarily increases
                       retail costs of medicines compared to other nordic countries the example from
                       sweden proves that the regional availability of medicines can be safeguarded at the
                       same time when general availability of medicines and competition in the markets are
                       increased in my opinion it is important that pharmaceutical distribution as a whole is
                       part of the solution when healthcare reform is on the planning board in finland

                       an interesting year ahead
                       the past year was busy and the new year seems to offer many new and interesting
                       projects i want to thank all our customers and employees for the year 2016 and hope
                       that we may together do this year 2017 at least as successful
