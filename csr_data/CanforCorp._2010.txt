as a forestry company dependent on a renewable natural resource for our products
sustainability underlies everything we do from the forest to the customer we have taken
this approach and integrated it in every aspect of our business

the sustainability of our natural resource the timber supply and associated plants and
animals is of course paramount considering we have been entrusted with comanagement
of 134 million hectares of public forestland in canada however equally important is
the health and safety of our employees the quality of the air land and water around our
manufacturing facilities and the support we provide to our operating communities

by its very nature wood is one of the most environmentally sound building products trees
continually store carbon in the form of cellulose throughout their lifetime when a tree is
harvested and turned into a wood product much of that carbon continues to be stored

at canfor we are committed to utilizing as much as we possibly can from every tree that
is harvested our primary focus is of course the manufacture of lumber however we
also fuel our energy systems with residual fibre stemming from the lumber manufacturing
process pulp and paper manufacturers of which we own or partially own four mills use
our wood chips

we also have a wellestablished safety program that
continues to improve each year we are industry leaders in
this category all safetyrelated incidents are investigated
thoroughly and we seek to learn from all of them every year
we set new safety targets and continually challenge ourselves
to improve on an already impressive record

we appreciate that as a large company various communities
have come to depend on us first and foremost we provide
muchneeded employment for these communities the last
three years of terribly depressed markets have forced canfor
to make some very difficult decisions which have resulted
in the indefinite closure of some of our operations this
was done to ensure that the company as a whole managed
to survive the prolonged downturn we look forward to a
time when these mills can reopen in the meantime we
are ever mindful of the overall health of the company we
must ensure that we are economically viable and capable of
restarting operations when markets improve

canfor has also been forced to reduce the number of
donations it provides in its operating communities we are
still supporting key charities like the united way and our
employees have shown an equal spirit of generosity through
their own efforts to raise funds for this charity when this
downturn comes to an end canfor looks forward to providing
greater support for worthy endeavours we appreciate the
patience organizations that depend on our contributions have
shown throughout these challenging times

the publication of our sustainability report is in keeping with
our commitment to be transparent about the way we conduct
ourselves while carrying out our business operations this includes reporting on our
commitment to operate in an environmentally responsible manner our initiatives to create
a safe work environment for employees and our contributions to enhance the communities
where we live and work

    manufacturing
    compliance report
    canfors commitment to transparency also extends into our manufacturing processes the following is an inventory of compliance for canfors
    whollyowned manufacturing operations


    in 2009 canfor had the following noncompliance situations reported in accordance with government noncompliance reporting criteria


    air
    at one wood products operation a burner operated below compliance temperature for a portion of two days due to reduced mill production
    following a mill fire at another operation an hydraulic oil spill was cleaned up with wood residue and subsequently burned in a standby
    beehive burner without prior approval of the ministry of environment moe temperature charts for the same burner were not changed and
    submitted to the moe as required


    effluent
    no issues in 2009


    landfill
    in 2009 two operations submitted late annual landfill reports another operation submitted an incomplete report and another operation
    deposited volumes to their landfill in excess of the annual permitted limit


    spills
    canfor manufacturing operations had 4 reportable spills in 2009 all were contained cleaned up and preventive actions taken the spills all
    involved hydraulic oil one due to a ruptured hose on a piece of mobile equipment another due to a valve accidentally struck and opened and
    two due to damage to hydraulic hoses on mobile equipment by wood debris one of the spills was reported late to the moe




    performance versus objectives in 2009


    air quality
    in bc we will continue to work towards phasing out canfors remaining tier 2 burners canfor currently has one operating tier 2 burner


    performance
    we are evaluating several options for phasing out the one operating burner including utilization of the surplus wood residue for combined
    heat and power generation


    audits
    we will conduct corporate environmental audits of five sawmills and one remanufacturing plant


    performance
    three sawmill audits were completed                                one of the sawmills that was to be audited was indefinitely closed   the other sawmill and
    remanufacturing plant will be audited in 2010

                                                                                                                 c an fo r co r p o r at i o n sus tainab i li t y r ep o r t 2010   5




objectives and targets for 2010


audits
we will conduct corporate environmental audits of five wood products facilities


greenhouse gases
we will update our company greenhouse gas strategy


improving our performance
canfors greenhouse gas emissions ghgs were less in 2009 than prior years due in part to reduced operational levels and related reduced
fossil fuel use startup of the 112 million fort st john sawmill barkfired heat energy system in april 2009 has resulted in a substantial
reduction in natural gas purchases previously used for mill heat and lumber drying this will reduce canfors annual ghg emissions by an
estimated 12000 t co2eyear on an ongoing basis and contributed to the 2009 emission reductions a second new energy system under
construction at mackenzie virtually identical to the fort st john system will start up in may 2010 and will also substantially reduce natural
gas purchases and ghg emissions
