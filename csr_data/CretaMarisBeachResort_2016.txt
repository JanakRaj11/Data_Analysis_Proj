message from the ceo
andreas metaxas


the amount of resources someone has is of minor importance in comparison
with his willingness and expertise to implement these resources

the literal meaning of the word sustainability in greek is associated with the
concept of bearing fruit eternally αειφορία  αεί  φορία in familiar lan
guage sustainability means to produceuse a resource while maintaining the
balance that exists in nature balance was always important for creta maris
and i personally believe that it is balance that brings progress development
and prosperity both literally and figuratively

the main pillar of creta maris beach resorts operation is its sustainability pro
gram many people believe that sustainability development is a set of simple
actions which can be superficially implemented

for creta maris the sustainable development is a complex process that re
quires careful planning and connection of multiple data in order to achieve its
objectives through this development we become better more efficient thus
contributing to the protection of nature its systems and generally to the life
itself as a company as partners as people

the amount of resources someone has is of minor importance in comparison
with his willingness and expertise to implement them hence the implementa
tion of a sustainable operation and development should be applied by every
one in this way we will be able to live together in harmony and above all in
balance with our environment


in the next pages we report all those actions which for us mean
sustainability

                                                                 enjoy reading

planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda     reviewed using a set of global indicators these will be compiled into an annual goals

creta maris adopts these 17 goals established by the un gets inspired by them and        at creta maris we intend to monitor and support the scope of this difficult task and
consider its obligation to contribute to the understanding promotion and support of       pursue to inform the upcoming generations about all the challenges they will face
the related intangible assets


it is important to mention that the objectives and their implementation appears to
depend on

a the support of local food producers in any possible way and any cost in the view of
   the upcoming undervalued climate change
b the support of local food producers through the newly planned development poli
   cies of
         the enlarged policy makers
         the global it business  electronic communication and
         the global industry of tourism

it is also important to mention that for the goals to be reached everyone needs to do
their part governments the private sector civil society and ordinary people



the 2030 agenda for sustainable development calls on countries to begin efforts to
achieve the 17 goals over the next 15 years the goals address the needs of people
in both developed and developing countries emphasizing that no one should be left
behind broad and ambitious in scope the agenda addresses the three dimensions of
sustainable development social economic and environmental as well as important
aspects related to peace justice and effective institutions

the mobilization of means of implementation including financial resources technology
development and transfer and capacitybuilding as well as the role of partnerships are
also acknowledged as critical

at the regional level countries will share experiences and tackle common issues while
on an annual basis at the un the highlevel political forum on sustainable devel
opment hlpf will take stock of progress at the global level identifying gaps and
                                                                                                                                                                                    13

412 professional environmentally
friendly cleaning detergents
during the past years 2013 2014 the use of green products for the resorts
rooms cleaning was up to 80  90 each year the use of these green prod
ucts and its increase in comparison with the previous years is a goal for the
management of the resort this is why in 2015 we continued to use the ad
ditional ecological cleaning product for our kitchen department needs in this
way the amount of the environmentally friendly detergents of creta maris is
13 of the total consumption of detergents of the entire hotel and rising to
464300 liters increased consumption by 300 liters compared to 2014
as regards the other sections because of the lack of a complete line of green
products on the market creta maris preferred to use the least harmful products
to the environment




note the amount of the environmentally friendly detergents is reported imprinted in
their concentrated form which means that the actual used quantity is greater than 13
of the total consumption of detergents in the entire hotel

                                                                                         40

     the solar panels installed in order to heat the water are resulting in sav
       ings of 580000 kwh  year during 6 months of hotels operation which
       are equivalent to 65000 lt of lpg
     currently the liquid propane gas has replaced the electricity in all kitch
       ens and main laundry stations

       led lamps 3303 headlights in 2015 thus saving 5006000 watt in total
     training and information are given to the staff so they can operate energy
       saving measures switch off lights and equipment when not in use etc in
       their daily activities
